        "transcript": "SPEAKER_06:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the next agenda item is a recommendation to receive and file a presentation on the City Auditors Fraud Hotline and the City Auditor. Laura Dowd is here to present. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much and could you introduce your team? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, thank you very much, Vice Chair. I'm Laura Dow, the city auditor, and this is my deputy city auditor, Alvin Chiu. He'll be going over a presentation regarding our broad hotline today. And first of all, I'd like to thank the commission for having us here today. And thank you for all of your dedicated service that you provide to the commission. I know you take your roles very seriously, and I know that you've been very dedicated in the hours and the work that you've put in. I also want to acknowledge the ethics officer Heather. She's been great in reaching out to our office and has been working with Alvin. And we're looking forward to continuing that working relationship to implement some things that we can do together. So we'll continue to work on that. I just wanted to write off the bat, just let you know that everything that we present today is on our website. So there's links to our website. There's instructions, there are materials, there are summaries, there's reports. And all of the information we're happy to answer any questions anyone has today. But if a question comes up later that you think of later, feel free to reach out to our office or you can look to our website at city auditorlora.com. And so all of it's there if you have any future questions. As an overview, I'd like to go over sort of the what, who, when, where, and how regarding our Auditor Fraud Hotline, and then my deputy city Auditor Alvin has a PowerPoint presentation that he'll go over regarding the case management and how we handle our Fraud Hotline cases. So first of all, I want to let you know that one of my very first priorities when I first took office as the city auditor was to reinvigorate the Fraud Hotline. It had been dormant for a while. And this was one of our top priorities. So we established and reinvigorated this hotline. And there are very, there's three very simple, easy ways for the community and the public to report Fraud Hotline calls. The first one is through the phone. We have a Fraud Hotline and it's at 1-888-Fraud07. There's also an online form on our website, again at cityauditorlora.com. And there's also the My Auditor app. It's a free app that you can download on the app store at the app store or Google Play. And all the three of these ways are very easy, user friendly ways for anyone to report Fraud. As a reminder, it's important that the public know that within our jurisdiction, it's just that Fraud Waste and Abuse that deals with the city of Long Beach only, not the county, state, or federal. Also, there are these forms of reporting can all be done 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and in all in any language. We have a third party vendor who handles our Fraud Hotline call and it's open 24-7 and it's available in all languages. The who is, you know, one of the most valuable things about our Fraud Hotline is that allows anyone to report Fraud, whether it's a vendor, a business owner, a citizen, and employees that they can confidentially report Fraud on this Fraud Hotline. And according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, they say that 42% of Fraud is detected by tips, which is more than three times the rate of any other detection method. So we encourage people if you don't, \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  If you see something that doesn't feel right or seem right, is probably not right and we encourage you to report it and we will investigate it and look into it and Alvin will go into that a little bit more in his presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  The Y is some of our best audits have come from tips from the Fraud Hotline. One in particular was the Animal Care Revenue Audit. There was a situation where discrepancies of deposited revenues were found. And upon discovery, the city management asked our office to review revenues and confirm if Fraud did occur. Through my office's findings, we provided critical evidence in the prosecution of an employee who embezzled $250,000 in the 11-month period that our office reviewed. There was another situation where \nSPEAKER_02:  the audit, it morphed into an audit of our police and fire public safety dispatcher overtime audit. And this was a tip that was in regards to overtime that led to this audit. And it found that 911 dispatchers were working a significant amount of overtime. \nSPEAKER_02:  up to nearly 100% of their salaries. And this was due to a considerable amount of vacancies. And not only was there a cost of $1.3 million incurred for the overtime, but this type of excessive overtime can lead to serious dispatcher fatigue and burnout, which caused unnecessary risk to public safety. So our recommendations resulted in changes to the dispatcher staffing levels and schedules, as well as improved recruitment efforts to fill those vacancies so that the overtime would go down so that the dispatchers could be alert and aware on their A game when they're working such a critical function for the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  And with that, I'd like to turn the time over to Alvin Chiu for his presentation, a PowerPoint presentation, on our case management. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Laura. Commissioners, my name is Alvin Chiwama, Deputy City Auditor here in the City Auditor's Office. And I'll cover a little bit more in detail about the Broadhot Line, which I'm in edge. \nSPEAKER_00:  You guys may recognize Laura Doud as our city otter. She's been the city otter since 2006. Our mission statement is to make Long Beach better through independent audits and fraud investigations. So, fraud investigations is the key pillar to our mission. Laura's already gone over the ways in which people can submit a complaint or tip through the fraud hotline. One thing I do want to point out is that by utilizing a third party operator, it gives the caller or complainant or tips their greater anonymity. There's certain organizations where they utilize kind of in-house either a voice mail system or they physically pick up the phone whenever someone calls in. With caller ID, a lot of people may not know how to block their number. They may feel a little bit more apprehensive. So, having that third party creates an additional layer that kind of provides them that feeling that their identity will be protected should they choose to remain anonymous. \nSPEAKER_00:  In terms of our fraud hotline, the annual average over the past three years has been 44 cases closed. Of those 44 cases that were closed, 42% were investigated either by our team or the department. And I'll get into a little bit more later how that department investigation process works. In terms of the team itself, we've got myself, I'm the deputy city auditor. We also have two staff members and of course Laura is our city auditor and she oversees the fraud hotline. A little bit about my background. I was formerly a manager with KPMG's forensic group doing a lot of corporate investigations and corporate compliance work. I also managed the city of Los Angeles, fraud, waste and abuse hotlines, so pretty much the same thing but just for the city of Los Angeles. So my entire career has been really within this realm of investigations, audit and compliance and I've been doing this for 17 years now. \nSPEAKER_00:  Additionally, the team has a varied background. One team member has a bachelor's degree in accounting, and the other has a master's degree in public administration with a bachelor's in international relations. So we'd like to have not only the skills of being certified fraud examiners like myself in law, but also having people with accounting backgrounds and people with more of a social science background. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I'll cover this real briefly, but basically we only involve the hotline if it's relating to city fraud. City fraud is a variety of things that could be theft of cash. It could be misuse of city resources like someone's taking a city vehicle home or using it for personal errands. It could be a violation or abuse of city policy, kickbacks or bribery. Things that we don't cover are employee grievances. So if it's HR complaint, my supervisor is yelling at me or giving me an unfair work assignment, those things we will hand off to HR. \nSPEAKER_00:  Unfortunately, sometimes we do get calls that are completely unrelated to the city, like credit card fraud or if it's something relating to the state or county. And I'll get into a little bit of how we handle those, but that's something that is part of our efforts to try and educate the public that the fraud hotline is related only to city fraud. But we understand that sometimes people are just looking for help so we try and help them the best that we can. \nSPEAKER_00:  In terms of the case handling process, what we like to do is treat every single case exactly the same in that we look at objectively, and no matter how big or how small the complaint might be, we will always look at it. The first step is to really determine whether or not that allegation or complaint is within the purview of our fraud hotline and whether or not the facts as presented are accurate. If it ends up being right off the bat, unrelated to our fraud hotline, so not fraud waste or abuse against the city, we will forward the complainant to the appropriate agency or department. We'll provide them the information. You can contact this person, et cetera, or contact this agency. \nSPEAKER_00:  If it is related to the city, then we'll conduct a preliminary review. And that preliminary review will be a review of facts, review of any potential evidence. And any way that we can try and independently corroborate the information that's being presented in that complaint. If the complaint has merit, then we'll proceed to a full investigation. And if at that point, the investigation substantiates the complaint, then we'll forward that information to the appropriate city administration or to law enforcement or to a prosecutorial agency. And we always ask for follow-up as to the final case disposition, just so that we can report back. Because ultimately it's something that came through our fraud hotline. And we want to show that we take every case seriously and that we're taking appropriate action. \nSPEAKER_00:  I want to touch on two important pillars of our fraud hotline, the first is confidentiality. This is something that is a best practice and something that we take very seriously. When it comes to confidentiality, it applies what I like to say a two-way street. The first way is the complaint details themselves are kept confidential. Our staff do not divulge it. In fact, we have an internal firewall within the city otter's office that those individuals who do not work on the hotline do not have any access whatsoever to our hotline information. That prevents this information from potentially leaking out. On the flip side too, we also keep the work that we do mostly confidential. Sometimes the tips or complainant will say, what have you done with my information? Have you investigated this? What's the status? Is it founded? Give me an update. I am quick to say confidentiality applies both ways. We take the information and we take appropriate action. But what we do is that we do not tell the actual complainant themselves. However, we still do customer service. That customer service is whenever a case comes through, we immediately acknowledge that we've received it. There is nothing worse than speaking out into the void and getting no response back. We do acknowledge that we've received their case. If there is any additional follow-up questions, we will follow up with them. A lot of times, complainants in the heat of the moment while filing the complaint may forget information that's critical for us in order to investigate it. And then when the case is closed, we do communicate with the complainant and say this case has been closed. But we do not provide any additional information such as, thanks for the case, your case resulted in XYZ. In terms of customer service, sometimes folks are contacting the hotline because there's no other way to get in touch with the city department or they're unaware of how to get in touch with the city department. So we made for their information to that department. But we don't let individuals utilize the hotline as like a shortcut. Like, oh, I'm going to contact the hotline and therefore be able to get to some live person faster than some alternative means. \nSPEAKER_00:  And a lot of times too, we do unfortunately get cases that are of low quality. Either it's something just outside the realm of possibility. It's a vent that doesn't really pertain to fraud waste abuse or it could just be simply very, very low information. So that's just part of the nature of operating a hotline. \nSPEAKER_00:  For department referrals, they can either go out as a request for response or no response requested. It really depends on the level of the complaint. We do notify the appropriate department personnel if we are referring a complaint out. Typically, it will be the department head and or manager of the bureau. That would be responsible. We also, if it's a city manager department, we copy both the city manager and assistant city manager on these allegation memos so that they're aware of what's going on within their departments. \nSPEAKER_00:  For the departments we do ask that they fill out an allegation or allegation response form where we populate questions that we would want answered had we been the ones doing the investigation ourselves. And that really ensures that the department is taking appropriate action to investigate the complaint. They're not just brushing it aside. And then we'll review those responses when those responses come back. And just because the responses provided doesn't mean that the case is closed. It's not closed until we believe that the case has been sufficiently reviewed and appropriate action has been taken. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sometimes we do get, like I mentioned, the human resources related complaints for things like that. Those would be outside of our purview and we would not ask for a response. \nSPEAKER_00:  As Laura mentioned, our city employees are the best ways, are the best tips we get are from city employees. So we try and focus a lot of our promotion towards city employees. Obviously it's all public for anyone to consume on the city otter lorddow.com website. But we also do things like send out emails to city employees with a copy of our annual hotline report. We have bulletin board post things available. And we do also attend the new employee orientation where we discuss our hotline and the benefits of the hotline and how city employees can contact us. \nSPEAKER_00:  Moving forward, I think you guys may be aware, but we're going to be working with Heather, the ethics officer on combining the current hotline with the ethics help line. And it's going to share a singular phone number, which has the benefit of less confusion when people are trying to figure out who to contact. And also, of course, there's the benefit of cross-promotional if we're distributing posters, one for the ethics help line, one for the fraud hotline, and they use the same phone number. Your phone number is being seen by more people. \nSPEAKER_00:  In terms of the operational logistics, that's going to be TBD pending the actual implementation of this combined hotline, which is going to occur in the months to come. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for taking time to listen to our presentation and city auditor and I are here to answer any questions that you may have. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'd like to recognize Commissioner D. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Chair. So first of all, thank you. It's been a year. Great to see you all again. \nSPEAKER_01:  before the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  really would like to thank the triad Heather. \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_01:  the two of you and working together. I know how difficult it can be, establishing new church and sharing areas, but I think that it does look like it's going well, and we hear nothing but great feedback from Heather about the partnership. I think that that's, it's critical. I wanted to ask a little bit about, if it's appropriate, Alvin and Laura, to talk a little bit about the summary that was provided. And if there's, if you don't have the information before you, that's fine. \nSPEAKER_01:  In one of the allegations where we're speaking about, we have a finding. Tell me a little bit about the process of adjudication goes to HR or does it go, tell me a little bit about the adjudication of that. When there's, for example, allegation one. \nSPEAKER_01:  and two. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I'll defer to Alvin as he is the one who handles our case management. \nSPEAKER_00:  So any time there's something that's been substantiated, it's then brought forward to the department to confirm their understanding. Whether it's something that they've conducted an investigation themselves or something that the Fraud Hotline team has done. And if the department agrees that the allegations substantiated, they note it as such. And then the department will indicate what action items are taken as a result. It could be employee discipline, it could be additional training, it could be creation of new policy. It really depends on what that exact item is. Unfortunately, I'm not in the position to disclose the details again due to confidentiality. One thing to note on our annual reports, we take great care to. \nSPEAKER_00:  be able to provide some information so that the public and city employees can see the types of actions that were taken, but at the same time they are, we make the descriptions as vague as possible so that nobody knows exactly what that is so they can't say, oh yeah, this was this person, I know I don't think it's possible. So we don't want to disclose more information beyond what is already publicly posted. \nSPEAKER_01:  appreciate the keeping it innocuous and that's a best practice for sure. I wanted to know a little bit about, for example, on the control weakness found in number two and also conflict of interest concern with the city vendor. I look at these as opportunities perhaps with Heather because those lessons learned, whether you're following the sentencing guidelines or anything along those lines, even to be woven back into the new training. I know that we're looking for material, nothing is better than a real life case, I think, for employees. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I think that's all I had on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's it. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner shot well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you and I agree with Commissioner B. Deb and Edictus. Thank you very for the well thought out presentation and the work that you have done especially since we last got together And a couple of questions on the third party vendor that you use for a hotline \nSPEAKER_05:  That vendor provides the ability to provide anonymity. Does the vendor also provide the ability to do a two-way conversation while maintaining that anonymity, you know, where the individual will be instructed to call back in and case more information is requested or needed? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so if the complainant would like to remain anonymous, what we can do is we can post follow-up questions through the vendor's platform. And the complainant is provided information on how to log back in and they're actually instructed by the hotline operator to check back within 10 days to see if there's any follow-up questions. \nSPEAKER_00:  It does occur where we do get that communication going, but sometimes unfortunately people put in the complaint and they disappear. And so we give them a couple of weeks. If it's something like a complaint that says, someone is stealing money and they don't tell me who that someone, where that occurred, how much money, and they don't answer any of the follow-up questions that we post at that point. We unfortunately have to close the case due to insufficient information, but yes, the vendor does provide that ability to have the two-way communication while still maintaining anonymity. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. If I can just add one thing, just to remind those who do provide tips, the most information you can give the better, the who, the what, why, when, where, how much. The more details they can provide, you know, the easier it is for us to do our jobs too. So anyway, the online forum does have all the information we're looking for. So it's all there just if they could fill it out. And also the third party vendor also is trained to provide those pertinent questions that would be most helpful for an investigation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. Does the online forum go through the third party vendor or are they totally separate? \nSPEAKER_00:  It goes through the third party vendor too. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think you said there was an average of about 44 cases per year. And I think you've had 52 close by via tip because you've had it in place longer than, obviously, in place longer than a year. That's not an average of 52. \nSPEAKER_00:  The average over the past two years has been 44 cases closed. Okay. It doesn't, we don't track the number of cases, well, we can, but we don't report on the number of cases received. We look at what we've been able to close during that calendar year. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. Well, that was my next question, so you just answered it. One last question. What is the percentage, and you may not be able to answer this, but what is the percentage of, uh, \nSPEAKER_05:  calls that come in or contacts that are anonymous. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't have that information right now, but that's something I can look up and get back to you with. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  the majority though. \nSPEAKER_02:  The majority are anonymous. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, that helps. And yeah, there's no need to get back to me with a specific number. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_06:  Really quickly, I'm just curious. You mentioned in your presentation that the, oftentimes the best tips that you receive come from the city's own employees. If it was in the data presented and I missed it, I apologize and I understand that the platform providing obviously for confidentiality and anonymity, and an in-mitty, excuse me, limits this somewhat. But I'm just curious at a high level. If you have any idea what percentage of the complaints that you receive come from internal city employees and what come from the public at large. \nSPEAKER_00:  Unfortunately, that statistic would be hard to come by because when people follow a complaint, they know whether or not they report themselves if they're city employee or not. And in my experience, the self-reporting is inaccurate. And it's just, you know, after doing this for a while, you can kind of tell if somebody is an insider with inside knowledge that only a city employee would have, first is someone who's a complete outsider and yet sometimes that outsider seeming to, they mark themselves as a city employee. So I don't have that statistic and I wouldn't trust that statistic either. But I think the reason why I'm saying the \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  best tips come from city employees are because the cases that are fruitful and lead to actual action or we find that the complaint was substantiated. \nSPEAKER_00:  in my experience typically it's because it's someone who's seen it firsthand and can provide that level of information that only a city employee would have. Sure. \nSPEAKER_06:  That makes sense. Do you think in your experience, perhaps personally, that the public is able to properly take advantage of these resources? Do you feel like the public can be better represented as a source of tips with this setup that you guys have? Understanding, of course, that yes, I completely understand that over time, it would perhaps appear that internal employees might be able to provide information that is more actionable. I'm just curious at a high level, if you think the public can be better represented or better served through these resources. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, I think that the fact that the fraud hotline is here in the city auditor's office and the city auditor is an elected official gives us greater access to the public than say if the fraud hotline was based in some internal department. That's more internal facing. In terms of educating the public, I think you, Laura can probably speak to this. This is something that is part of our mission statement. Laura is out there in the community and talking about this all the time because it's something that's not only important to the city, but it's something that's yielded great benefit. So, you know, I think that educating the public about this hotline is something that we do take seriously and something that we do on a frequent basis. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think when the public gets put on hold when they call into the city, we like to have a voice recording that they can call the fraud hotline. It kind of comes and goes according to who's controlling that message, but we're trying to be as innovative as possible and letting the public know that this is available. We have it on our website. We have fact sheets. I speak at neighborhood association groups and business groups and I bring our materials there. We also speak to the new employee orientation group. I know that's where employees. But we're communicating the best way we can and we're open to other options and ideas as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Just a couple things. In this part of this relates to one of the items that's coming up later, but I do think there is some reference to the fraud line in the ethics handbook, but we need to make sure that that continues and is highlighted. And then my other question was just in reference to what Commissioner D. Benedict has started asking about. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that has to do with the detailed report about the different allegations. And where you do notice a weakness in the control weakness, as you call it, are those being collected? \nSPEAKER_03:  and reported back to whomever might take action to improve those controls. Because I think that's the type of thing that this commission maybe could help on, especially when we're like looking at the vendor policy or things like that perhaps. That's one that comes to mind. So we need to learn what we can from what you're finding out in these things. Is there a process for sharing that? \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll have to go back and think about it from a confidentiality perspective, but I don't. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm open to it at this time. One thing to note in terms of those control weaknesses that we identify, as part of our overall audit process, I'm talking about audit, not fraud hotline, our audits also identify control weaknesses, and we make certain recommendations to the departments to address these deficiencies. And the departments have the opportunity to agree partially, agree or disagree with our recommendation. And that carries over into our fraud hotline too. If there are additional control enhancements or recommendations that we've identified as part of the investigation process, we will also prepare a management action plan for the departments to complete where we list out our recommended control enhancement. And it's up to the departments to agree to implement it or if they disagree, they provide an explanation to us. And that's something that we do track and we do follow up with. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, I just like to add that those fraud hotline tips that result in an audit as Alan stated are audits make recommendations and we always allow the audit to the department to respond to our audits. And we have the matrix with all of our action items and then we ask them what they are doing in responding to the recommendations that we're making. What actions are they taking to respond and when will that action be implemented so there's dates available. We also every few years do implementation audits where we go back and look at all of our audits and go back to the departments and ask for a status on the implementation of the audit recommendations that we've made. So we have done two of those implementation audits and this is all done at the department head level so that department heads know what they are and what the recommendations are and what we're expecting to be implemented. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, I think the question now is, are those available? Yes. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, those are the audit reports from the fraud hotlines. They are all available on our website. The animal care revenue audit that we, that I talked about earlier is on our website, the dispatcher 911 emergency audit. That's also on our website. We had another audit regarding our parks maintenance and that park maintenance audit on our website as well. Our jock audit was a result of a fraud hotline tip as well and our jock audit is also on our website with all of the recommendations that it made for that. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, well, the genesis of my question and the concern of my question is just that whatever can be learned and done better as a result of things that come through the fraud hotline without disclosing things that shouldn't be disclosed to discourage, you know, violate confidentiality. We want to just be sure that we take advantage of those things because we want, you know, at the same time we want people to report as much as needs to be reported, we also want everything to operate better than, you know, as well as it can. And so we learn from these things. So, yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  We share the same sentiment with you and feelings about our work. And the most important thing about our work is the implementation of the recommendations that we make. And so we're doing what we can to ensure that these things are being implemented and it changes our being made. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks a lot for your report. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there any public comment on this agenda item? \nSPEAKER_04:  I would like to thank you very much. I noticed we had three years worth of reporting in this. And I know we didn't have you before us last year. It's actually been more than that. I think it's been two years. Hopefully we can get onto an annual schedule. Because it's very informative. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hopefully we can. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  our next agenda item. Did you want to say? \nSPEAKER_05:  Did you want to.. Sorry. Emotion \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, I'm sorry, that's right. We have to have a vote on the... \nSPEAKER_04:  recommendation to receive and file the presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a motion. \nSPEAKER_04:  from Commissioner Feedler, seconded by Commissioner D. Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_06:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_18:  Our next agenda item is a recommendation to discuss amendments proposed to the lobbyist ordinance. Long Beach Municipal Code Chapter 2.08 by the ad hoc committee on the lobbyist ordinance, including community outreach options and if appropriate to provide a recommendation to the city council regarding the same and dissolve the lobbyist ordinance ad hoc committee. And I'd just like to say a couple of preliminary points first as \nSPEAKER_18:  encompassed in the agenda item one thing that we intended to talk about today was community outreach on this particular issue. When we discussed this ad hoc committee report at the February meeting, we were disappointed that there weren't members of the public present because we really did want to get community input. I'd like to thank the Long Beach Post for covering our February meeting and while we were trying to \nSPEAKER_18:  Figure out ways to get public comment. We've gotten public comment. So thank you very much for the press coverage and for the publication of this very important issue. We did receive some written comments. \nSPEAKER_18:  in advance of the meeting and I assume that some of the people here are present in order to address this issue and I'd like to thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedules because this is an important issue and one in which we very much want to hear public comment. There is, there was concern at the February meeting about how to address the issue of neighborhood associations and I know some of the written comments address that issue and hopefully we'll hear some additional comment. There have been some written comments submitted as well so I'm hoping that we will be able to receive the comment from those who have come in person, we'll review the written comments. If we have time we will have some discussion. \nSPEAKER_18:  among the commission today. \nSPEAKER_18:  But we are not going to close this issue because I think the ad hoc committee needs some time to absorb all of the public comments that we have received and consider the appropriate approach. I would like to say the chair. \nSPEAKER_18:  Unfortunately, it was not able to make it today. She is on the ad hoc committee and specifically wanted to make sure that we address two issues. One is the issue of neighborhood associations. \nSPEAKER_18:  She has continued concern about the about how appropriately to include neighborhood associations or not and also in our individual meetings with city council members They a number of of the members of the city council raised concern about the report reporting requirement imposed on electeds and senior city officials given that there is very limited staffing available and we are concerned obviously about non-imposing \nSPEAKER_18:  requirements that are so burdensome as to take away from other important work that are city officials and are elected have to do. In order to \nSPEAKER_18:  Properly allocate time. I'd like to find out how many of the people in the audience intend to provide \nSPEAKER_18:  comment at this meeting. \nSPEAKER_18:  Okay. The City Council, I believe when there are more than 10 people who want to provide comment, cut the available time. \nSPEAKER_18:  JT they normally cut the available time from three minutes to \nSPEAKER_39:  90 seconds. \nSPEAKER_18:  to 90 seconds. I think in order to address this issue and provide as many people as possible an opportunity to present will be keeping each individual to 90 seconds for comment. \nSPEAKER_18:  And with that, would the folks who want to provide public comment, please line up. \nSPEAKER_26:  I got it. It's okay, thanks. \nSPEAKER_26:  Get out first. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_26:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  I have a question for city attorney. \nSPEAKER_18:  One or more of the commissioners might have questions they'd like to put out right now to say, hey, we would really appreciate hearing on these issues. May I provide an opportunity for commissioners to speak for a minute or so before we accept public comment to identify those issues? \nSPEAKER_31:  So as long as the commissioners are engaging in a question and answer session with the community, if there's specific information you'd like feedback on, that's totally fine. \nSPEAKER_31:  You could do that now before the public begins commenting so that they're aware. \nSPEAKER_18:  I'd like to recognize Commissioner Feeler. \nSPEAKER_34:  Thank you very briefly. I have reviewed the correspondence we received in advance of this agenda item. I very much appreciate all of the excellent feedback. I see a long line of folks so I don't want to cut into people's time and people are certainly not obligated to respond to a question I have but I am generally curious. I'll just phrase it this way. I noticed in a lot of the correspondence that many of the organizations that were providing comment to us echoed the commission's overall goal of increasing transparency in city government. I saw an overall theme that the recommended changes to the lobbying ordinance would pose an undue burden on many different organizations. This has been discussed in past meetings and there have been materials provided by the ad hoc committee that are available for the public to receive but I am curious if any of the organizations that wish to speak today \nSPEAKER_34:  view the changes as furthering this commission's goal of increasing transparency in city government. \nSPEAKER_34:  If, for example, the burden was shifted from your organizations to the folks on the other side of the same communication that we're talking about, namely the elected officials, whether it be the mayor's office or the city council, council men or council women that your organizations meet with. So right now, I understand that certain organizations are exempt from any sort of reporting requirement. If rather than putting the onus on organizations that I understand are very understaffed to comply with the increased reporting requirement, if the burden were then shifted instead to, for example, the mayor's office or a city councilman's office, what would your organizations think then of such a shift of the burden? And again, free to address it or not, but that's a general question I have, and I'm hopeful that we can receive some feedback on that issue. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Would any of the other commissioners like to speak on before the public comment? \nSPEAKER_18:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_18:  Please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_26:  Hello, my name is Julie Dean. I've been on the board of the Bill Munchaw Residence Association for 14 years, and I'm now the president. Last August, I graduated from the Neighborhood Leadership Program, which is a five-month program offered by the city to provide grassroots residents with the skills, knowledge, and resources to make a difference in the quality of life of our communities. As neighborhood leaders, we struggle to stay on top of city projects, processes, and legislation because we're volunteers working during our free time. City outreach and communication is often lacking. \nSPEAKER_26:  We have to learn who is in charge of what departments have different requirements and some city officials avoid responding to us. And in response to what you were saying, I think that would even be worse if they had to do all the reporting. \nSPEAKER_26:  But we continue because we care about our community and our neighbors. Even when the topic does not affect us as individuals, we still work to ensure the best possible outcome for our area. To start requiring that we as overworked volunteers begin recording and documenting our prep time, working hours and interactions with city officials would be an undue burden. It could also create more of a hurdle in receiving responses from city staff and elected officials. Additionally, the BSRA operating budget is less than $1,800 a year. So how can we be compared to lobbyists? And if nonprofits with a $50,000 or less annual operating budget would not be required to register, then why would we? Finally, the current registration fee of $129 in the potential daily late piece of 32 would be burdensome to our organization. So we ask that you not include neighborhood organizations and thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Let me make this higher for you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Good afternoon, sorry to make it this higher. I am Michelle Byerlie, the Executive Director of the Nonprofit Partnership that many of you know. We've been a nonprofit support and resource in the community for 30 years. And as an organization supporting over seven nonprofits in the region annually work extremely concerned about the possibility of eliminating the nonprofit exemption from the city's lobbying ordinance, specifically also expanding the scope of the ordinance to include advocacy, which is a part of our daily work. And quickly to respond to the idea of placing the burden elsewhere, we are highly regulated and already report on our lobbying efforts and don't need another layer of reporting requirement to all of our information is public record and can be looked up. \nSPEAKER_05:  So back to some statements. We support greater transparency in government, and we also believe that all nonprofit organizations with being included in this blanket ordinance, particularly redefining and advocacy places a significant burden on nonprofits and create substantial barriers and hesitancy for nonprofits operating for the public good. Non-profits should continue to be exempt from the lobbying ordinance, and we are concerned that it hasn't been fully examined, that potential impact of this proposed ordinance and shift on nonprofits and the full implication of that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Nonprofits are mission driven. They have to provide detailed documentation, tax filings, registration to ensure they meet the requirements of the tax exempt status, including lobbying limits. \nSPEAKER_05:  and my colleague can finish some of our comments. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hi, I'm Ariana Kennedy. I'm the Operations Manager of the Nonprofit Partnership. Additionally, all nonprofits are required to have a board of directors to ensure that they stay true to the mission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Non-profit simply do not have the capacity to comply with multiple and conflicting lobbying requirements. Non-profits would have to remove staff or volunteers from providing critical services to the community, resulting in possible loss of funding and limiting their ability to deliver on their mission. The checks and balances exist already. \nSPEAKER_03:  the city of Long Beach. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_03:  is proposing extraneous and unnecessarily reporting requirements. \nSPEAKER_03:  This proposed revision would be in direct conflict and lacks alignment with the direction of the hardworking city. \nSPEAKER_03:  departments trying to make collaboration with nonprofit partners more efficient, impactful, and less burdensome. \nSPEAKER_03:  Long Beach is a well-resourced city with an abundance of nonprofits who care about the individuals and the community as a whole. \nSPEAKER_03:  It is what makes Long Beach an amazing and vibrant community. The proposal to remove the nonprofit exemption would have direct impact on the relationships nonprofit organizations have with the city of Long Beach. We ask that you fully consider the implications before changing requirements to do our work. \nSPEAKER_03:  that would take us away from serving the community. TMP is available to support exploration and the impact and offers our nonprofit as a resource. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Hello, my name is Gina Radiken. I am the president of the Belmont Heights Community Association, and I believe my statement will directly answer your question that I feel that including neighborhood associations specifically would place a real limitation on our performance. And I do believe that it would cause our district candidates to limit their, \nSPEAKER_13:  time and connectivity with us. I do have a couple questions if you can explain to me why you believe that neighborhood associations \nSPEAKER_13:  are considered advocacy groups or why we would be considered lobbyists. And I also would like to know what would happen to an organization that could not afford to pay their fines if each year it accumulates up to $500. Is there an actual punishment that comes with not paying their fine? I also would like to know if there's a clarification between like our organization is a 501-C3, but we also are a neighborhood association. Could we then just abdicate as an official neighborhood association and can take you to act as volunteers who want to help better our community like how we're having an Easter egg hunt next month and make a difference day with just a 500 or more volunteer day where we do good throughout the neighborhood. So those are really my questions to you and thank you for your time. Have a great day. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. Just one second. It looks like the people in line may be in line for quite some time if we keep everyone standing. We've got a good sense now of how many people we've got and we will try to hear from everyone. Why don't we just have maybe four or five people stay in line? The other folks, if you want to sit down, you're welcome to. Hopefully you're... \nSPEAKER_18:  compatriots will allow you to get back in line where you were so people don't have to stand for an hour. \nSPEAKER_18:  Please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_16:  Hi, I'm Estella Tahudor and I'm with the Bill Mottshore Residence Association. I applaud that the Ethics Committee wants to gain clarity and transparency in dealing with City Hall. I have encountered incredible frustration dealing with our city government when inquiring about procedures and proposed plans. \nSPEAKER_16:  I and other citizens who choose public engagement have been ignored, marginalized, and disrespected by high ranking members of public works, development, \nSPEAKER_16:  and a few council members. \nSPEAKER_16:  There seems to be no accountability. \nSPEAKER_16:  to inform or include the constituency. \nSPEAKER_16:  This move to impose regulations on community groups that parallel professional lobbyists, I believe is well intentioned. \nSPEAKER_16:  but it is unrealistic as well as onerous. \nSPEAKER_16:  We already have full-time jobs. We advocate for our community in our limited free time. And to create these requirements on top of our advocacy efforts, we'll seriously curtail our ability to engage in civic matters. I think this is a very important issue for community groups, which is why I'm missing work on a Wednesday afternoon to address you. Please reconsider. \nSPEAKER_16:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_04:  My name is Brian Cochran. \nSPEAKER_04:  Three years ago, I was barely aware of the community organizations within a \nSPEAKER_04:  my only half-release of my building. \nSPEAKER_04:  I was trying to gain awareness on a number of issues regarding our \nSPEAKER_04:  neighboring businesses, et cetera. \nSPEAKER_04:  today, though. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm a board member of one of the community organizations. \nSPEAKER_04:  I am a founder of another community organization and I participate in a 10 meetings of \nSPEAKER_04:  I have does another community organizations. \nSPEAKER_04:  Those matter. \nSPEAKER_04:  What you see before you on the agenda item is actually indicative, the fact that you were thinking about community outreach exactly reflects the problem with transparency and communication from the city on behalf of its residents. It's not proactive. There's a directory that exists where you could reach out to every one of the organizations and the people here that would have known about this before it was reached the media. That's a problem. That's where the burden should be. \nSPEAKER_04:  when you address the question of \nSPEAKER_04:  trying to figure out \nSPEAKER_04:  where the owner should be. The owner should not be on these people and the groups that are doing it freely and voluntarily on behalf of others. \nSPEAKER_04:  It should not be necessarily on the \nSPEAKER_04:  Officials themselves because if that creates a chilling effect that keeps us at the door while lobbyists paid professionals like the Long Beach Restaurant Association Get sit down with the mayor the council members and we gonna get the past the door because they cite the Brown Act or other impediments to not sitting down with groups of 10 or more. That's a problem \nSPEAKER_04:  That's the starting point where you should be for this discussion going forward. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_38:  Yes, hello. My name is Ian Patton, a board member with the River Park Coalition and also co-founder of the Long Beach Reform Coalition. \nSPEAKER_38:  There's a basic constitutional issue here. \nSPEAKER_38:  Citizens in a democracy have a right under the First Amendment to petition their government for redress of grievances. That means they have a right to access unimpeded to their government, their elected officials. \nSPEAKER_38:  And what's going on here seems to be conflating, and it's really bizarre conflating ordinary residents with pay lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_38:  There's only one word for that. Bonkers. It makes no sense whatsoever. \nSPEAKER_38:  Ordinary residents have a right in a democracy to access their elected officials. Pay lobbyists are representing economic interests. That's why they're regulated. And the impetus behind this seems to be that they want to inhibit the ordinary residents acting individually or coming together as community organizations because they consider that a level playing field. They want everybody to be burdened with the regulations they are rightfully burdened with. But they are supposed to be treated differently. They are different. They have the means to deal with these regulations and they're not acting as residents in a community. They're acting as representatives of economic interests. Now reforming the law. \nSPEAKER_38:  For unions, I mean union presidents are some of the biggest lobbyists in this city. That's fine. It would make no difference in their life if they had to register as lobbyists because that's what they're doing. They're paid. They have staff. It's an economic interest. But for ordinary residents and community activists to have to register, like show your papers to a city Gestapo just to talk to their council member after a certain number of hours ridiculous. \nSPEAKER_25:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_25:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_25:  Hi, corelessly here. I'm a number of neighborhood organizations. \nSPEAKER_25:  With respect to proposing that the neighborhood groups and nonprofit organizations should have to register as lobbyists and pay to talk to their council members. \nSPEAKER_25:  Keep books on every email and contact. That is just wrong. \nSPEAKER_25:  Lob being is an effort to exert influence on an elected. And yes, neighborhood groups and nonprofits attempt to exert influence. There's nothing inherently evil about lobbying. It's when you attempt to exert influence via quid pro quo and in favor of a special interest that you are introducing corruption. \nSPEAKER_25:  The reason there is a requirement to register as a lobbyist is to bring the light of day into the corrupting influence of lobbying. \nSPEAKER_25:  Professional lobbyists are the typical culprits. They take money from special interests and attempt to obtain favorable outcomes for their employer and themselves. Members of neighborhood groups are volunteers. They are not paid advocates. \nSPEAKER_25:  Neighborhood groups and nonprofits are looking to make the world a better place to raise issues. And some of those issues are safety issues. Do you want less of those? \nSPEAKER_25:  Do you want us to do less? Because now if I get my part group together, each one of us has to anti-app money. \nSPEAKER_25:  to be able to pay to come and talk to our Council member. \nSPEAKER_25:  I mean, do you want less of that? Because I think that is wrong. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_35:  Hello, my name is Van Gruenum here with Long Beach Resils empowered or Libre. \nSPEAKER_35:  As nonprofits, we do not have any financial incentive or gain when we talk to our elected officials as we're advocating on behalf of marginalized community members. \nSPEAKER_35:  I want to make it clear that nonprofits help make local government and act on one civic duty more accessible. \nSPEAKER_35:  to the community members in our network, which mostly consists of historically marginalized folks like BIPOC, low income renters. \nSPEAKER_35:  to remove this exemption for nonprofits would only add more of a burden and additional barrier to us and fellow renters from being able to advocate for our community's needs. \nSPEAKER_35:  We do not have the same capacity, resources, and systems in place as paid lobbyists do to be able to navigate this proposed ordinance. \nSPEAKER_35:  Preparation alone takes a significant amount of time for us to work directly with community members. \nSPEAKER_35:  Many of whom are limited, are limited English speakers to help them understand the \nSPEAKER_35:  political systems in place and empower them to participate in the domicrotic process. \nSPEAKER_35:  The voices of low income and marginalized communities have historically been excluded in the policy making process and eliminating this non-profit exemption. \nSPEAKER_35:  but only further tie the hands of the organizations fighting for inclusion. \nSPEAKER_35:  protection. \nSPEAKER_35:  protecting these communities. \nSPEAKER_35:  protection that Canadians can be used as their \nSPEAKER_35:  We urge you all to maintain the existing nonprofit exemption in its lobbying ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_35:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_32:  My name is Jimmy Eklund and I work as part of Long Beach Residence and Powered, protecting renters from getting evicted, getting displaced, and facing other situations that are some of the most stressful situations they've ever faced in their lives with no help whatsoever. \nSPEAKER_32:  The goal of regulation is to control something that you think might have an adverse effect. \nSPEAKER_32:  What is the potential adverse effect of community groups and nonprofits advocating for the public good? \nSPEAKER_32:  Um \nSPEAKER_32:  lobbying is regulated because of the potential for corruption. \nSPEAKER_32:  that corruption comes from money to interest, potentially bribing. \nSPEAKER_32:  or influencing public officials through money. It's not just from talking to people and advocating for the policy that you desire. It's because of the money that's there, and that's not what community groups and nonprofits are doing. \nSPEAKER_32:  So I don't understand why you would want to regulate this activity. \nSPEAKER_32:  It just doesn't really make sense. \nSPEAKER_16:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_36:  Hello, my name is Myra Fernanda and I'm a resident of council district two and I'm here representing Long Beach residents empowered. The first time I stepped foot in city and the chambers of the city of Long Beach was in late 2019 right before the pandemic began. I came to address my council members and share my story as a suffering renter and a constituent of the city with the support and backing of the organization Long Beach residents empowered. Libre taught me how to address council members and how to remain involved with the city and thanks to those experiences and education. I am now here today actively advocating not just for myself, but for the majority of suffering rent burden renters that have come to the organization for help as well. Because of our ability to advocate alongside nonprofit organizations such as Libre, we have helped influence important housing policy decisions that have ultimately helped and benefited marginalized renters in the city. Non-profit to provide direct services and support to historically marginalized communities are trusted members of the community. As 501C3 organizations, we already report our lobbying work to the federal government and we have limits on lobbying imposed by the federal government. Removing the exemption is a disservice to the process of developing public policy. These organizations help increase representation of the issues of marginalized and low income communities. \nSPEAKER_36:  making such organizations jump over yet another hurdle to register and report as local lobbyists is likely to have a very chilling effect on their participation in public debate. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_07:  Everyone, Matt Gardibossi with Long Beach Agives. Thank you for providing the space to speak to you all. There's been some really incredible comments made by my colleagues, my peers. I think it's also just really important to note that the nonprofit sector in large part exists to meet, to bridge the gap between what the public needs and what \nSPEAKER_07:  Governments are able to provide for their citizens. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think removing \nSPEAKER_07:  removing lines of communication between people and organizations that are providing services. \nSPEAKER_07:  for residents of our city. \nSPEAKER_07:  It is very problematic. I think it's we're creating, creating barriers to providing services for residents. And we're also creating elected officials who aren't aware of the services that are being offered in their districts. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think as an elected official, I would hope that all of our council members and our mayor want to be informed about the incredible work that's being done. \nSPEAKER_07:  by all of these organizations and hundreds more. \nSPEAKER_07:  so that they can better serve their constituents. \nSPEAKER_23:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_23:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hi, my name is Jason Mercado and I am a resident of Council District number two. And I am also a community organizer with Long Beach Residant and Powered or Lee Rae for short. Lee Rae is a small grassroots nonprofit organization that focuses on keeping people house by informing them of their rights, empowering the tenant leaders to pursue and improve their way of living for their community. \nSPEAKER_01:  Over the last year we had the privilege to help those ten and leaders to come out to this wonderful place we are currently located in to give them an opportunity to speak on items that concern them such as the right to council or even to support the ordinance and the declaration of the state of emergency on the homelessness issue. \nSPEAKER_01:  And of course, with us to us the nonprofits to back them. \nSPEAKER_01:  community-based nonprofits often include residents in their advocacy, so elected officials can hear directly from people. \nSPEAKER_01:  who need increased protections, such as \nSPEAKER_01:  fighting to stay in their homes, increase access to health care, and of course immigrant rights. \nSPEAKER_01:  These instances often serve as the first direct interaction between residents and elected members and changes to the lobbying ordinance with diminished these types of opportunities. The voices of low income and marginalized communities have historically been excluded in the policy making process and eliminating them and eliminating the nonprofit exemptions will further tie the hands of organizations fighting for the inclusion and protection of these communities that they deserve. We urge the ethics commission to maintain the existing nonprofit exemption and its lobbying ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Buenas tardes, mi nombre es Maira Garc\u00eda. \nSPEAKER_09:  Good afternoon, my name is Mara Garcia. \nSPEAKER_11:  y soy parte de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Libres. \nSPEAKER_09:  and I'm part of the organization, Leave It. \nSPEAKER_11:  y vivo en el distrito de Of. \nSPEAKER_09:  in a live and cancelled district. \nSPEAKER_11:  Gracias a organizaciones como Libre, Lombish Forward y la colisi\u00f3n de migrantes. \nSPEAKER_09:  and thanks to organizations like Leigh-Vere, Long Beach Forward, and other organizations. \nSPEAKER_11:  han pasado moratorias que me han beneficiado a m\u00ed y a otras personas. \nSPEAKER_09:  and there has been a lot of ordinances that have helped me and other people. \nSPEAKER_11:  porque conocen lo que hemos pasado. \nSPEAKER_09:  because they understand what we, in a comprehend what we've been through. \nSPEAKER_11:  y va a ser desalojada injustamente. \nSPEAKER_09:  and I was going to be evicted unfairly. \nSPEAKER_11:  y gracias a estas organizaciones que conocieron mis problemas lucharon por una monotodoria. \nSPEAKER_09:  And thank you, thanks for these organizations that understand \nSPEAKER_09:  My problems, they fought for the right. \nSPEAKER_11:  y hist\u00f3ricamente las voces de la ciudad de las comunidades marginadas y debajo sin gris o sancidos excluidas. \nSPEAKER_09:  Historically, the common marginalized voices of those of low income \nSPEAKER_09:  have been excluded from the process to formally political affairs. \nSPEAKER_11:  del proceso de formulaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas y la eliminaci\u00f3n de las exenciones sin fines del lucro. \nSPEAKER_09:  from the process of formerly political affairs and in the emulation. \nSPEAKER_09:  elimination of exemption of nonprofit organizations. \nSPEAKER_11:  Ater\u00e1n a\u00fan m\u00e1s las manos de las organizaciones que luchan por la inclusi\u00f3n y la protecci\u00f3n que estas comunidades merecen. \nSPEAKER_09:  and you will hold these organizations back. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  which fight for the inclusion and protection that these communities deserve. \nSPEAKER_11:  instamos a la comisi\u00f3n de \u00e9tica a mantener la execci\u00f3n de fines de lucro existente en una ordenasta de cabildeo. \nSPEAKER_09:  We have. \nSPEAKER_09:  or re-erage from the ethics commission to maintain \nSPEAKER_09:  the exemption of a nonprofit existing. \nSPEAKER_09:  in the ordinance of lobbying. \nSPEAKER_11:  las organizaciones infinias del lucro que brindan servicios, directos y apoyo a la comunidad. \nSPEAKER_09:  the nonprofit organizations that provide direct services and support to our community. \nSPEAKER_11:  hist\u00f3ricamente marginadas son miembros confiables de la comunidad. \nSPEAKER_09:  which have been historically marginalized are trustworthy units of our community. \nSPEAKER_11:  el impacto de las enmiendas propuestas ser\u00eda \nSPEAKER_11:  que las organizaciones infinas del lucro. \nSPEAKER_09:  The impact of amendments proposed would desist from the local efforts and defense. \nSPEAKER_11:  se retiran de los esfuerzos locales de cabine de hoy de defensa. \nSPEAKER_11:  porque les preocupa perder su estatus. \nSPEAKER_09:  and defense due to them being preoccupied to lose their status of exemption of taxes. \nSPEAKER_11:  Por lo tanto, la ciudad ya no se beneficiar\u00eda de nuestras voces en el debate p\u00fablico. \nSPEAKER_09:  Therefore, the city would not benefit from the weight of our voices in a public debate forum. \nSPEAKER_11:  en el que ayudamos a levantar las voces de los residentes marginados. \nSPEAKER_11:  y privados de sus derechos. \nSPEAKER_09:  in which we help live the voices of marginalized residents and exempt them from their rights. \nSPEAKER_11:  Gracias por dejarme escuchar mi voz como organizador y como parte de la ayuda que recib\u00ed de ellos. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you so much for listening to me and for making sure that you hear about the help that I received from these organizations. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_29:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  you \nSPEAKER_21:  Good afternoon commissioners, my name is Joanna and I'm here representing Long Beach forward, a local nonprofit who tirelessly works to ensure that community members are supported, engaged in their communities and are active participants in local decision making processes in our city. We work with community members to ensure that they have the housing policies and protections, language access resources like interpretation and the overall life-affirming resources. \nSPEAKER_21:  the overall life reform affirming resources that are meant to support and protect our communities. Our overall city budget or from the overall city budget which advocating for advocating to reinvest crucial city dollars into our Black, Brown and immigrant communities who are severely under-resourced and most marginalized in our city. \nSPEAKER_21:  clumping nonprofits in the same category as paid lobbyists who are employed by wealthy special interests who seek to personally benefit is offensive and deeply concerning. Professional lobbyists are often paid to push for the despicable policies that harm marginalized communities. In contrast, the work of 501-C3 nonprofits is rooted in increasing civic engagement and dignity within communities that are intentionally excluded due to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, disability, and income. We are community members here who are providing services, education, and any other resources to support and ensure that our most vulnerable communities embrace their power and advocate for the things they know will increase their quality of life here in Long Beach. We are not here to capitalize or make personal gains with monetary funds. Please take a moment this afternoon before voting and when you do vote. And ask yourself, is it ethical to actively work towards the disempowerment of the community? The voices of low-income and marginalized communities have historically been excluded in the policy-making process and democracy at large. We ask that you vote against this and protect our rights to speak up and have the engagement of our community. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_21:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, I have 90 seconds, I'm gonna make this fast. So good afternoon members of the Ethics Commission. My name is James Swazo, and I'm a six district resident and the Executive Director with Long Beach Forward. As a 501-C3 nonprofit organization, Long Beach Forward's mission is to create a healthy Long Beach with low income communities of color by building community knowledge, leadership, and power. So regardless of our racial and economic differences, all of us believe that people deserve to have a say in the decisions that impact them, which is why these recommendations in front of us are deeply upsetting. First, we believe that these recommendations are a step backwards in this progress. So to lump residents and organize groups of people who care about communities in the same vein as professional lobbyists who financially gain from lobbying is not just unethical but also immoral. As nonprofits, we do not have any financial incentive or gain when we do our limited lobbying as we are lobbying on behalf of marginalized communities. And I hope that the presence of all the nonprofits here helps illuminate the severity. \nSPEAKER_00:  And the burden that these barriers in these recommendations would place on our organizations. Adding additional requirements and reporting not only further burdens over burden groups, but it takes away time from doing the mission-driven work that nonprofits are founded on and established to do, especially as our local governments. \nSPEAKER_00:  allow COVID, error, safety and protections to expire. Non-profits are now being forced to fill the gaps and address the continuing needs that exist within the city. I also do want to say that you all respectfully ask for more public comment and for us to come here and reduce down to 90 seconds as an additional burden. I do want to also take the time to address the commission of proposals and acknowledge that the proposal as stated by Commissioner Field there is problematic because it still conflates, uses conflicting definitions for lobbying than the federal government and would include advocacy and prep time. And these things are also problematic for nonprofits. So even if it was city staff doing the burden of the reporting, it would still stifle and show the collaboration between nonprofits and organizations and break that trust. So I really want to encourage you all to acknowledge and recognize going back to the root of the problem. These recommendations feel like it's a solution in search of a problem. And we really want to encourage you to ask you to reconsider these recommendations by removing the vague and overarching advocacy requirements, remove the addition of nonprofits and neighborhood associations, and do the due diligence about reaching to people directly impacted. Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_18:  you \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Good evening, commission members. My name is Samaria and I'm a resident of District 3 and a community organizer at Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. As a nonprofit community organization serving the most vulnerable and underrepresented residents of Long Beach, the work that we do is vital to the livelihood of your constituents. \nSPEAKER_14:  We know this to be true because before, during and after the pandemic, we have served as a rapid response hotline that helps closely existing gaps between resources and accessibility. \nSPEAKER_14:  Community-based nonprofit organizations hold a unique role in our city, because we have direct contact and have built meaningful relationships with community members that are the most excluded from policy-making processes despite being the most impacted by said policies. \nSPEAKER_14:  I know many senior us, women like my mom, who have so much love for the city, but are excluded from participating in these meetings because the information being shared isn't available in their native language. \nSPEAKER_14:  You see, the work that we do isn't just reflective of our community needs. The work that we do is reflective of our commitment to include the voices of the constituents that you otherwise would have never heard from. \nSPEAKER_14:  to adopt a proposal that would require community-based nonprofits to register as lobbyists, impacts our organizational capacities, and by default it would be a direct attack on the inclusion, representation, and empowerment of the voices most excluded in our city. \nSPEAKER_14:  undocumented working class people of color. We urge you to continue to examine profits from its existing lobbying ordinance so we can continue to do the work that is at the heart of what makes Long Beach the beautiful and diverse city that it is. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Good afternoon, my name is Gregory Johnson. I am the board president for the Arts Council for Long Beach. We all agree with, especially in these days and time, with the new administration that arts and culture is an essential service towards our recovery out of the pandemic in the recent years that we have been. So much so that the City Council has formed an arts and culture and tourism committee. We recognize that arts and culture is very, very important to the recovery of the city that said to put regulations on advocacy. We are intrinsically linked with the city. So we're talking to \nSPEAKER_12:  Government officials, the parks people, how do we enter into parks to repair our murals? A paint new murals? How do we support the arts and community all across this city in every way, shape, form, and fashion? Our advocacy committee is hard at work doing this work. Our board, we are, okay, everybody has, we talked about how they are volunteers, our board, we are volunteers, but we are putting in the work that is required to advocate for the art. How can we be regulated in such a way that you put forth? \nSPEAKER_12:  when we are already intrinsically joined at the hip with the city. I would submit to you, and I'm going to ask this question of the committee. We are a public corporation, which means we're doing the business of arts and culture on behalf of the city. Is what we are doing through our advocacy, servicing our client? Or is this lobbying and advocacy as you've described and needs to be so regulated? I just think we're providing a service to the city. We have a history of doing a next and a job. We have a high reputation across the state in doing so. And so to put such regulations on us is a detriment to the progress of the city as we recover. And it's definitely a detriment to all of the arts and creators all across our city. Thank you so much. We need more information, and so do you all. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Austin Tuerre. I'm a long time resident and president CEO of the downtown Long Beach Alliance. I'm here speaking on the half of the downtown Long Beach Alliance, which oversees the two business improvement districts in downtown, as was a member of the Council of Business Associations also known as COBA, which is comprised of the various business improvement districts throughout the city of Long Beach. I'm here to express my great concern about the recommendations being put forward by the ethics commission and stand in solidarity with the other government, not on profits, neighborhood associations, and business improvement districts in the city of Long Beach. To provide some background and context and business improvement districts, where districts established by the city council to provide services and programs within our designated areas. We are chosen by the nonprofits or chosen by the city council to provide those services and to implement them within their districts. Across the city are bid serve as the leading voices, as well as on bidsmen to many of the services the city provides, recording a economic development to provide information on services from the ED team to businesses, record nating with public works to look at infrastructure improvements within our various districts, and record nating with special events to bring community events to property owners, small business owners, and residents. Our primary function is to communicate and coordinate with city departments, as well as city officials in our respective districts. \nSPEAKER_02:  Because of our quasi-governmental nature, we're also required to adhere to proud act requirements as well as the public records act requirement. So the issues of transparency and open meeting are fulfilled by those requirements. And I would just add lastly, I understand the commission is trying to look at greater transparency in the government, right? It's the rightful thing to do and it's the top priority of the ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_32:  please wrap it through comment your time is up. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm wrapping up. However, lobbying for as an integral part of the democratic process at all levels of government, however the commission should approach their work updating this ordinance in a more nuanced eye rather than a broad approach which they are taking right now. Thank you for the time. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_37:  Good afternoon, I'm Romeo Hebron, Executive Director of the Filipino Migrant Center. We are a nonprofit based in District 7 where we serve low-income Filipinos. As a nonprofit, we don't have any financial gain when we lobby on behalf of the marginalized communities that we serve. \nSPEAKER_37:  It's our goal to help make local government accessible and accountable to its constituents by including residents in our advocacy so elected officials can hear their concerns firsthand. \nSPEAKER_37:  We've worked alongside many other nonprofits to advocate for the city's language access policy. So residents could avail of different city services, key documents and meetings. In 2015, our community supporters successfully advocated for our organization to secure a space in a city building in West Long Beach where we continue to be rooted in the heart of the community that we serve. \nSPEAKER_37:  Since nonprofits already have lobbying limits set by the federal government, our limited capacity to handle multiple and conflicting reporting requirements could prevent us from participating in future lobbying efforts. The proposed amendments would take time away from serving the people and serving the community and uplifting the needs of our residents. \nSPEAKER_37:  Historically, the voices of low income and marginalized communities have been excluded in the policy making process and eliminating the nonprofit exemption will further tie the hands of the organization's fighting for the inclusion and protection our communities deserve. The Filipino Migrant Center urges the ethics commission to maintain the existing nonprofit exemption in the ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_23:  Good afternoon, my name is Omar Karvanas, I'm a resident of the Sixth District and organizing director with California's Forgestions, which is the statewide and local youth serving organization. \nSPEAKER_23:  I'm here just to urge the commission to maintain the existing nonprofit exemption in this lobbying ordinance. And I really just want to echo a lot of the comments or all of the comments that have been made here by some of the nonprofits and other folks advocating for the maintenance of this exemption. \nSPEAKER_23:  I believe they're not doing so. We'll really lead to the decreased civic participation from low income, historic and marginalized groups in our city, and in particular young people. \nSPEAKER_23:  who ought to rely on nonprofit youth serving organizations to engage in democratic process. \nSPEAKER_23:  I want to just share really quickly some of the experiences I've had as a community organizer from meeting with young folks and city leaders to packing out the city hall, some of the most historic moments that this city has ever seen. We have built a youth movement here in the city that has led to some of the most historic wins. For example, the Children and Youth Fund, the first ever Children and Youth Fund in the city, and now the establishment of the Office of Youth Development. Those wins would have not been possible, had not been for the work, the tireless work and effort of nonprofits, many of who are here today. And so I really just want to urge the commission to really consider continuing this exemption, because it's really important for us to continue to do the work that we're doing to empower, engage, and mobilize, and activate our young folks in this city. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_20:  Hi, my name is Susanna Sniem and I'm the Executive Director of United Kim Bowdoin Community. I also serve as the Chair of the Midtown Business Improvement District, which is in Kim Bowdoin, Utah. \nSPEAKER_20:  And I am concerned about the removal of the exemption for non-profits. We'll continue to marginalize the Kimballton community here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_20:  UCC provides services in health equity, youth enrichment, community integration, and economic inclusion. \nSPEAKER_20:  Our strategies include being able to connect our community members directly to services and resources, but also we \nSPEAKER_20:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_20:  empower and we build the capacity of our community members to engage in the city processes. \nSPEAKER_20:  to help build equitable policies and systems for our community members. \nSPEAKER_20:  advocacy is such a key strategy to our work. \nSPEAKER_20:  and \nSPEAKER_20:  It's our work in equity and policy structures that affect the Kim Bowdoin community. \nSPEAKER_20:  We are that bridge because we have the language capacity, we have the cultural understanding to be that bridge within the Cambodian community. \nSPEAKER_20:  and I urge you to keep the exemption for non-profit and business. \nSPEAKER_20:  improvement district so that we can ensure equal access for the Kim Bloating Community here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  Hello, everyone. My name is Gavir Nandiz, and I'm the Executive Director of the Long Beach and McGregor Rights Coalition. I'm also a resident of District 3 and our office is in District 1. I have a lot of questions for you all today. Who did you consult before bringing this forward? Have you talked to community groups? And other stakeholders? Who will benefit from this? What's the motivation behind this? \nSPEAKER_15:  I ask all of this, all of these questions, because you all should be asking this questions to yourselves. \nSPEAKER_15:  If this is recommended to Council in pass, this would require nonprofits like LBIRC, the Lombard Jimmy and Gregorite Coalition, to register as lobbyists, which we're not. Let me repeat that again. Organizers at organizations like LBIRC are not lobbyists, and so we should not register as such. \nSPEAKER_15:  Our organizations are doing critical work in vulnerable communities, and we are ready under staff. \nSPEAKER_15:  and the removal of this exception. \nSPEAKER_15:  would make a difficult for nonprofits like us to adhere to a limited amount of lobbying. \nSPEAKER_15:  activity and will diminish the voices of the community. \nSPEAKER_15:  of the most vulnerable in the city. \nSPEAKER_15:  of the people who seek to hold the Syria accountable. \nSPEAKER_15:  and in service to them. \nSPEAKER_15:  Our voices are already intentionally excluded, many times from government spaces, by design. So do not make things more difficult for organizations doing the work of serving vulnerable communities in Mon Beach to be excluded. \nSPEAKER_15:  to not make this recommendation to council and keep this exemption. \nSPEAKER_15:  It will impact the communities that we serve, all the people that you see here today. So do the right thing and keep this exception and don't recommend to counsel anything else. Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Good evening, everybody. My name is Jamilette, and I am the senior organizer for the Long Beach Immigrant's Rights Coalition. Happy Women's History Month. \nSPEAKER_10:  I have been organizing a lot of these for over six years as a student and three \nSPEAKER_10:  with LBRC as a community organizer. And it was soon into my organizing that I learned that the voices of low income and marginalized communities have historically and currently been excluded in policy making process. \nSPEAKER_10:  LBRC's first value is the following. We strive to build relationships that foster a sense of belonging, unity, and leadership, where we are intentional with our commitment to be driven by community and for community. We recognize and uplift the diverse voices and intersectional identities of the migrant community. \nSPEAKER_10:  Our organization has pushed a city in a direction that is not only includes but is driven by community members leadership. \nSPEAKER_10:  I have lost count of how many monolingual Spanish speaking low income immigrant women I have organized with and have come to Long Beach City Council for the first time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Even more so, how many more women have met with who had attended their first meeting with their council member for the very first time? And trust me, that requires \nSPEAKER_10:  really a lot of time to prep so that they feel confident and empowered and I'm so happy to do that and it's unrealistic for us to even have to track that. \nSPEAKER_10:  I point this out because LBRC has been committed to empowering immigrants in Long Beach to advocate for resources needed in our community. Our work is driven by community and for communities. \nSPEAKER_29:  community and for communities. \nSPEAKER_10:  As nonprofits, we do not have any financial incentives to gain when we lobby as we are lobbying informed by the needs of Long Beach residents who continue to be excluded. \nSPEAKER_10:  That's why we're asking the City Ethics Commission to continue exempting nonprofits from the existing lobbying ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_39:  What's up, y'all, my name's Eric. I'm with organizing and program manager with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. \nSPEAKER_39:  And I think I'm really thinking about this from like a cost benefit perspective. And really thinking about sort of like what the aftermath of this, assuming this sort of happens and goes all the way through. I think that as one of our colleagues mentioned earlier in terms of the impact that this would have on reducing the activity. And I think we should be encouraging community members and stakeholders to build their relationship with their council members and commissioners, especially if they're connected to and talking to people impacted by your decisions or indecisions. It's also worth mentioning that the sort of like umbrella term that's being used here as nonprofit. It's like not all, not all the different entities present here would be impacted the same way. I think there's like a question of resources and question around like how those resources would be divided. Two already limited groups with limited resources, which takes away from like programmatic or substantive work. And so I think the last thing I'll say is it feels strange to sort of take this approach without doing something something more substantive like limiting actual lobbying or limiting like money in elections. For example, in like by extension influence. \nSPEAKER_39:  I think there's more practical ways to approach sort of influence and transparency that isn't putting the burden on community groups and community organizations serving on Long Beach residents. \nSPEAKER_22:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_22:  Hello, my name is Heather Kern. I'm the executive director for the Belmont Shore Business Association. The Belmont Shore Business Association is a business improvement district, one of 10 in Long Beach. And I am a staff of one. Daily duties include talking to elected officials, every city department, special events. I just can't imagine how much work this would create. And also just looking at the room, this is just a drop in the bucket of the amount of nonprofits in the city. And I can't imagine if this were to go through the volume of reports it would generate and who would look at those, it would render it ineffective. I don't have a solution for you, but clearly this is not it. \nSPEAKER_22:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_22:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi, Dana Buchanan. As a fellow commissioner, I appreciate the work you put into this and delaying the vote on this tonight. \nSPEAKER_06:  I like lists, so I've made a little list of assumptions and guidelines perhaps for you to use moving forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number one, motivation I'm assuming is for this as anti-corruption. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number two, elected staff, elected and staff work for us. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number three, anything that provides total and complete transparency is the goal. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number four, number five. Focus should be on professional lobbyists. They're not hard to identify. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number six. \nSPEAKER_06:  Anything that stifles the public, aka the customers? \nSPEAKER_06:  ability to have access to elected elected's in management is not good. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number seven, anything that makes it harder for nonprofits to do the good work is bad. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number eight, if there is to be scrutiny on any non-profits, perhaps start with the ones that are founded and directly affiliated with the electeds. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm sure that's rich soil. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number nine, the public should always take precedence. The organizations are the public. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number 10, complete transparency is a requirement. \nSPEAKER_06:  not just here, but the entire thing. \nSPEAKER_06:  the whole show. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number 11, in addition, perhaps throw the lack of response to public records request into the mix. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number 12, please head in those directions. Thank you for your time and attention. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_28:  Hello, good afternoon members of the ethnic commission. My name is Jessica Quintana, I'm the executive director of Centro Ch\u00e1, the Long Beach Community Hispanic Association. We've been rooted here in the city of Long Beach for over 25 years. Most of residents have this great city for over 54 years. I've been working in nonprofit for my entire life. \nSPEAKER_28:  I've got this call probably the last two hours that this, you know, \nSPEAKER_28:  was coming before our city, before our ethics commission, as an organization that's been in the city for over 25 years. I don't receive any call from the ethics commission, from the ad hoc committee, anyone to engage our feeling as to how this was going to impact the nonprofit organizations. I'm very grateful for our Long Beach nonprofit who really reached out to the organizations because if this would have passed, that would have been a huge. \nSPEAKER_28:  Um. \nSPEAKER_28:  uprise in the community. So what I like to tell the commission today is \nSPEAKER_28:  What if imagine if this would have took presence or if this action would have happened during the pandemic? \nSPEAKER_28:  Do you know how many people would have not been reached without the nonprofits? Do you guys all know all of the relationships that we were calling the Council Office and agency departments and the lives that us nonprofit organizations were saving during that time? \nSPEAKER_28:  This is very disrespectful. \nSPEAKER_29:  Please wrap it up. And it doesn't bother you. \nSPEAKER_28:  And it doesn't value the work that we do as non-profit organizations in the city. We are not lobbyists. We work to increase the quality of life on behalf of the children, our families, our seniors, and our neighborhoods. \nSPEAKER_28:  So I encourage the commission to accept nonprofits and neighborhood associations. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_29:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_27:  Hello commissioners. My name is Zaidakar Sviyan. I'm the Executive Director of the Monster Foundation. \nSPEAKER_27:  and I urge you to keep non-profit exempt from the city's lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_27:  I'm here in support of our Long Beach nonprofit partners who have an arc, keenly articulating the importance of keeping nonprofits exempt. \nSPEAKER_27:  a little bit about the foundation. We invest about $4 million annually in 80 Long Beach nonprofit organizations. \nSPEAKER_27:  All those organizations support our entire community through after-school programs, shelters, clinics and hospitals. \nSPEAKER_27:  Overall, we support basic needs in Long Beach. And all of our nonprofits are working towards a public good. They are not lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_27:  All that support is in jeopardy, as our foundation does not support lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_27:  Our nonprofits lift the voices of marginalized communities and I urge you to listen to their concerns and the impact of this recommendation. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_24:  Good evening commissioners. My name is Laura Selmer. Thank you for allowing me to speak on this topic. I want to stress transparency above all. And I appreciate the commissioner mentioning that at first. If the burden is shifting where transparency is too hard on the nonprofit, maybe you can come up with something else. I did have an extra, I printed out. I mean, we have nonprofits working in the city with hundreds, you know, $30 million nonprofits. They're not small. Some are very large. We have a $100 million profit nonprofit here who's influencing policy in the city. Not all nonprofits are small. Some are very large. \nSPEAKER_24:  altruism is great. \nSPEAKER_24:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_24:  But I've worked for a nonprofit and I can honestly say it really dissolutioned me because not every human being has the ethics and the standards. And I worked for a nonprofit that \nSPEAKER_24:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_24:  go by the wayside because there was a lot of greed involved in \nSPEAKER_24:  in the running of that nonprofit. \nSPEAKER_24:  So I do believe in transparency. \nSPEAKER_24:  Um. \nSPEAKER_24:  I will tell you too. I was at a meeting last summer and one of the staff who they mentioned they were working with a nonprofit and we asked more questions. They said it was a secret they couldn't tell us. \nSPEAKER_24:  So, you know, keep a secret of city business and I'm going to put a lot of attention to that. So I do believe in transparency and I think nonprofits have to buy into a little bit of transparency too. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Both namely Tesla, and\u8eca Encourico. \nSPEAKER_29:  time. \nSPEAKER_18:  you \nSPEAKER_24:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  you \nSPEAKER_24:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Greetings commissioners, my name is Tony Bell. Today I'm representing Westside Long Beach Alliance. \nSPEAKER_08:  And we've provided each of you with a copy of a resolution that is opposed to the proposed amendment of the to the lobbyist ordinance. As a group of nonprofits and community groups based on the west side of Long Beach, we feel that our community and community organizations would be directly impacted in a negative way if this amendment is recommended to city council as it is written now. We understand that this proposed amendment aims to curb politicians' abuse of their relationships with some local nonprofits to further their political agendas, as well as a few nefarious actors. And we also recognize and support the ethic commissions efforts to promote transparency and ethical behavior in city government. But also believe that the proposed amendment may cause unintended harm to nonprofits, neighborhood associations and the like. However, the intent is admirable, but the application is thought. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sorry. I'd like to point out in the amendment appendix to Taylor Anderson deputy city attorney pointed out that the IRS rules distinguished between advocacy and lobbying. \nSPEAKER_08:  And if you go forward with this, this would be in direct contradiction to our federal protections under the Constitution. \nSPEAKER_08:  because \nSPEAKER_08:  There's a difference between what the federal statutes say, our lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_08:  and what you would be purporting lobbyist definitions are. And according to the supremacy clause in the Constitution, if there's a contradiction, you're supposed to go with the federal laws as opposed to the municipalities laws. So we ask you to please. \nSPEAKER_08:  your amendment, your proposed amendments. And do not impact the local nonprofits in this way because it would have caused a greater harm than it would do good. \nSPEAKER_07:  In the minutes and it isanan. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  Good afternoon, my name is Lily Martinez. I'm the Director of Health Education and Outreach for TCC Family Health. \nSPEAKER_19:  We're a federally qualified health center and also a nonprofit 501C3. We provide health and wellness services to the greater Long Beach area, behavioral health services, resources, education and advocacy for those community members that are most impacted so that we can increase access to health care and decrease health disparities. \nSPEAKER_19:  As a nonprofit and federal qualified health center, we're already highly regulated and we have strict limits on lobbying at the federal state and local levels, which also comes with extensive reporting already. \nSPEAKER_19:  The recommendation to include nonprofit health centers and all of the other 501C3s here in the room. In this lobbyist ordinance would pose an undue burden on all of our organizations that are most times very understaffed for the amount of work that we do. \nSPEAKER_19:  especially now that we're all trying to recover from the work that we all did together, echoing what Jessica said. We all pulled together all of us in this room to try to help all the community members come out of this very drastic public health emergency. So we request that we be exempt. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Are there any other members of the public who would like to comment? \nSPEAKER_18:  I'd like to thank everyone who took the time out to come today. As the agenda item notes and as I noted in my introduction, we very much wanted to receive public comment. We will take the comments we received here at the meeting, as well as the written comments that we've received. \nSPEAKER_18:  There was, I think we need to \nSPEAKER_18:  keep the ad hoc committee in place. I would recommend that the ad hoc committee take the \nSPEAKER_18:  comments into consideration and continue to meet. Is that okay? \nSPEAKER_31:  Yes, Vice Chair, you can choose to proceed in any way. So there's a couple options of how to do that. The recommendation. \nSPEAKER_31:  was to dissolve the ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_31:  You can choose to make a new motion. \nSPEAKER_31:  of how you'd like the commission to proceed. \nSPEAKER_31:  That motion does not have to acknowledge dissolving or continuing the ad hoc committee. You can continue the item. You have a lot of options here, but you do not have to accept the recommendation as written. \nSPEAKER_18:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_18:  I guess I'd like to hear from the other commissioners as to whether you would like the ad hoc to remain in place and \nSPEAKER_18:  come back to the commission having taken into consideration the public comment or if you want to schedule this for an agenda item with the full commission at which point we can discuss as a full commission the comments even if the ad hoc comes back I think what we would the ad hoc would do is summarize the public comment and propose any changes as are appropriate to the recommendation. \nSPEAKER_18:  in their view and then it would be up for discussion by the full commission. \nSPEAKER_18:  What's the thinking? \nSPEAKER_18:  Recognize Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_33:  I would be in favor of the ad hoc further considering the comments that have come before us today along with comments that were submitted in writing. And I would also be interested in knowing if the more about any of the federal requirements are those already fully laid out in the Atkitson, Edelsen memo or which I thought was more focused on the IRS or their separate federal reporting requirements. We can talk about it today or just want to know if that was, you know, I would like to have that fully considered by the ad hoc too. \nSPEAKER_31:  I'll have to check we had to defer to outside council on this due to the specialty of nonprofits and the tax issues. So that opinion came from outside council. I can check with them to see if the federal or all of the federal regulations that issue here were considered as well. And advise next time this item comes before the commission. \nSPEAKER_33:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  And I would like to note from the last meeting, Commissioner Chottwell had raised an issue regarding prep time. And we had a good discussion on that. And if the ad hoc does make changes, they would take those comments that the commissioners made at the February meeting into account as well. \nSPEAKER_17:  I'm not sure that we have \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_29:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  guys \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm gonna share a lot easier with my kids off. \nSPEAKER_17:  All right, well, let me start over since I wasn't officially on. First of all, I want to thank everyone for this input. This is exactly what we... \nSPEAKER_17:  needed to hear about from all of you and I hope that everyone will continue to send comments and suggestions about how this issue of transparency should be handled, how we achieve transparency and knowing how our decisions in our city are being made. \nSPEAKER_17:  and take and apply it fairly across the board. Procedurally, at this point, I would move that we \nSPEAKER_17:  continue with the ad hoc committee and that the ad hoc committee considered these comments and the comments that were came up in the last discussion of this at the February meeting. And come back with suggestions either modifying the report that was in recommendations that were previously made or making additional recommendations besides that report. \nSPEAKER_29:  you \nSPEAKER_18:  I have a motion. Do we have a second? \nSPEAKER_18:  And we have a second. Can we have a vote? \nSPEAKER_18:  over. \nSPEAKER_18:  Is there a public comment on the motion? \nSPEAKER_04:  Where did public comment check out? \nSPEAKER_31:  Vice Chair, you're okay. You already did public comment? Okay. \nSPEAKER_17:  What is the motion? \nSPEAKER_31:  Would you like me to repeat it back? \nSPEAKER_31:  So as we understand it, the motion is to continue the work of the ad hoc and for the ad hoc to consider the comments received in this meeting, both oral and written and at the last meeting in regards to the lobbying ad hoc's recommendations and to \nSPEAKER_31:  provide either a modified recommendation or proposed changes to the original recommendation. \nSPEAKER_31:  to mix. \nSPEAKER_18:  Do we have public comment on the motion? \nSPEAKER_04:  just make a brief that sends you a goal. \nSPEAKER_04:  and was to provide outreach options. \nSPEAKER_04:  will there be more outreach other than everyone who managed to get here for this and what you have on record previously. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_30:  Chair? \nSPEAKER_30:  We are. \nSPEAKER_30:  We do not need to do public comment again. We already did public comment on this item. \nSPEAKER_30:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_31:  Enough. \nSPEAKER_31:  you \nSPEAKER_30:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_31:  Okay. We already took public comment. \nSPEAKER_30:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_31:  you \nSPEAKER_24:  This is a question. \nSPEAKER_18:  Chair, did you want to take the vote at this time? Can we have a vote on the motion? \nSPEAKER_09:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_30:  Just a quick comment for folks leaving. We did raise the gates at the parking garage on Broadway and Chestnut if you park there. \nSPEAKER_30:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_18:  So this being the first meeting that I chaired my primary responsibility was to keep us on schedule and I have failed to do that. So I would like to I think we're. \nSPEAKER_18:  We're, yeah, we're pretty much behind schedule. I would like to defer the discussion of the ethics guide to the next meeting. We did also have a \nSPEAKER_18:  presentation on a community, a communication and outreach strategy for the ethics commission more broadly. \nSPEAKER_18:  April, is it okay? All right, if we differ that one as well. \nSPEAKER_18:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_18:  then I'd like to move to agenda item number six recommendation to receive. \nSPEAKER_31:  take care and have a good day enough! till Tigers put pressure, finale knight gonna ride pr\u00e9sent poder and tendon \nSPEAKER_18:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_31:  So for the ones that you want to lay over to the or do I need a vote? Yes, you do. So what I would recommend is identify all the items that you're suggesting. \nSPEAKER_18:  Um, \nSPEAKER_18:  need a vote. \nSPEAKER_18:  So what are you doing? \nSPEAKER_31:  to make a motion and have. \nSPEAKER_31:  You can enumerate all of the items that you'd like to have laid over and then have the commission vote on that. \nSPEAKER_18:  the eye. \nSPEAKER_18:  I would, I move to defer to a later meeting. \nSPEAKER_18:  Agenda items number four and five, the recommendation to receive and file a presentation on a communication and outreach strategy, and the recommendation to receive and file a discussion on the ethics guide and suggested next steps to update the guide. \nSPEAKER_18:  Do I have a second? \nSPEAKER_18:  I have a second. \nSPEAKER_18:  Should we take a vote? \nSPEAKER_37:  Did you want to see if there's any public comment? \nSPEAKER_18:  Is there any public comment on that motion? \nSPEAKER_09:  motion carries."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we move to recommendation to receive and file a monthly update from the ethics officer, including a summary of the ethics commission retreat. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Chair. Eric's gonna pull up the PowerPoint for it. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So just a quick summary, we met February 22nd, the Ronald Aries Equity Center. I just wanted to thank everybody for coming and participating. We got some good work accomplished. We were able to review our accomplishments over the last three years. We looked ahead to our education program launch, our helpline launch. Lot be as ordinance recommendations were discussed. Supplier code of conduct and ethics guide update is coming in the next year. \nSPEAKER_01:  We did our action plan goal prioritization exercise. Our top three priorities in this order. If you recall, yellow, the yellow happy face was our highest priority. \nSPEAKER_01:  The colors followed green and red for \nSPEAKER_01:  So the top priority that the commission collectively identified was 5.2, which is to identify penalties and discipline that can be imposed for violations and assess possible changes. Our second priority identified action plan 2.8, which is to establish process to provide advice and information to city employees in the public on ethics related issues. We are currently doing that. And then 3.2 create ethics training program based on code of conduct plan roll out and oversee deployment. So that is currently happening. \nSPEAKER_01:  tied for fourth, our three action plans 2.4 create comprehensive companion document to the ethics code to replace current ethics guide for long beach officials and employees. That was tabled for next month to begin that discussion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Action Plan 2.9 review, consolidate and propose modification or update if needed, complictive interest policies and establish EC role and investigation, which is Action Plan 4.3. And then our fifth place priority identified was Action Plan 5.7, which is for the Commission to conduct proactive audits on select campaign contributions and expenditures. And that's just a list of everything I just said for you to \nSPEAKER_01:  keeping your pockets. \nSPEAKER_01:  We also, there was a brief discussion on our ethics guide, which again we'll talk about more next month, but we talked about establishing expectations for the guide, our expectations, the commission's expectations, which include transparency, digital, comprehensive, but digestible, and we want to be sure to include values and compliance. There was a suggestion that staff compiled the first draft and then possible ad hoc this year. \nSPEAKER_01:  There was also a discussion about election-related regulations and tailor established that there was nothing for the commission to address at this time. And then there was a discussion about 2023 ad hocs again including the updated ethics handbook and then the commission's roles and responsibilities which we want to be sure to include a conflict of interest reviews. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then there was a yearly calendar review. So standing items on our calendar. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll continue to be Chair, Vice Chair, annual report, our budget agenda items and discussions, form 700 compliance reports, a city auditor annual fraud waste and abuse report, conflict of interest evaluations, and then action plan updates. There was a suggestion that the commission considered doing a bi-annual retreat that focuses just on the action plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that's the end of my summary. \nSPEAKER_01:  Do you guys have any questions on that? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think really a good question. By annual, you mean every other year? \nSPEAKER_00:  You mean twice a year. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Twice a year. I just wanted to make sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  twice a year. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, I might. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, Emma. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  I even looked at it twice in a second. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think just really quickly because I know we've been here a while today already just wanted to remind all of us to get our Form 700s in those are due by April 1st. The auditor gave us a brief help line update but just this week that the check was cashed so we have a contract in place with NavX for \nSPEAKER_01:  the help line partnership with the auditor's office. So Julian is working hard to establish next step meetings to understand how we activate all this and move forward. Coincidentally, this week, the learning management system went live. So there will be some workshops starting next week to train folks like me that will be building and uploading trainings. So we've had a lot of movement in just the last couple of days, which is good. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that's all I have this month. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Heather? \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a question. Did you ever present the log the final? \nSPEAKER_03:  more tentative logo and slogan after it came back from \nSPEAKER_03:  employees. \nSPEAKER_03:  and after \nSPEAKER_03:  They worked on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I did. That was the either you or Absinar, I think you had to leave early. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, yeah, I haven't even had some in the meeting so I must have been there. I love it. I have five. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Have a good night. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I was just curious how it all worked out. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I have a question for Heather also. \nSPEAKER_02:  I thought it was interesting the auditor's briefing. I still saw that there were areas, fraud waste to abuse, conflict of interest. You know, there's still these gray areas. So when opportunity arises and when you and Julian work these things out with her office, it would be interesting to hear how \nSPEAKER_02:  information will be continued to be shared or if there is actually going to be segregation in the duties. \nSPEAKER_01:  I agree with that. \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree with you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh-huh. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Do I have a motion to receive and file the monthly update from the ethics officer? \nSPEAKER_00:  We have motion from Commissioner Chautwell, seconded by Commissioner D. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can I have a vote? \nSPEAKER_03:  Did you want to check on Puppet Park? \nSPEAKER_00:  Is there any public comment on this motion? \nSPEAKER_00:  May I have a vote? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  motion carries."
