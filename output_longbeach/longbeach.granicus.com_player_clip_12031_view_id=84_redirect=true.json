        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Now we're ready for their regular agenda. \nSPEAKER_07:  and item one on top. \nSPEAKER_13:  Item 1 on tonight's agenda is a recommendation to approve a certificate of appropriateness to paint two murals and change building facade paint colors on elevations of an existing commercial building located at 2 8000 east fourth street. The property is developed with a non-contributing structure located in the Bluff Heights historic district and district 2. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Commissioners, Maryanne Cronin will be presenting this item. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Good evening Chair and fellow commissioners. Before you this evening is a request for a certificate of appropriateness to paint two murals and change the building facade paint colors on an existing commercial building, which is a non-contributing structure located in the Bluff Heights historic district. \nSPEAKER_11:  The subject property is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of East Forest Street and Temple Avenue. \nSPEAKER_11:  within the CNR, which is neighborhood commercial and residential zoning district. \nSPEAKER_11:  Currently, the property is developed with a commercial structure that was substantially remodeled from its previous use as an automotive repair shop. \nSPEAKER_11:  As some background, the subject building is currently housing a cannabis dispensary which was established in 2017. The structure is not a contributing building to the historic district due to the substantial alterations that have occurred over time to the building, which includes first story and second story additions over time. The previous uses have been an automotive repair shop, then a restaurant, and then the current dispensary that is there presently today. The historic for reference, the Bluff Heights Historic District's period of significance, is 1905 to 1950, and much of the remodel work has been done outside of that period of significance. \nSPEAKER_11:  The existing commercial building is shown in this photo, and it is oriented in the L shape layout, largely developed within the south-eastern portion of the rectangular parcel. The south and east elevations are constructed on or close to the respective property lines. The building features two north elevations, one at the first-story area, and one at the north, at the two-story portion of the building. \nSPEAKER_11:  Similarly, there are West-facing elevations that also are at one and two story elevations. \nSPEAKER_11:  The building is clad with solid stucco and features articulation through awnings and garage door windows that feature the north elevation at the one story portion. \nSPEAKER_11:  For reference, the one-story portion of the building features an approximately six-foot setback from Temple Avenue and a 50-foot setback from East Forest Street. The two-story portion of the building is setback approximately 38 feet from Temple Avenue and 30 feet from East Forest Street. \nSPEAKER_11:  This view is looking south towards the one-story portion of the existing structure where the window frames look similar to garage door openings. \nSPEAKER_11:  This existing site photo is facing east, so these represent the one and two story elevations on the western facades. And they show both those different articulations in the L shape building that I had mentioned in the previous slide. \nSPEAKER_11:  This is an alternate view due to the not a rectangular orientation. I wanted to make sure it was very evident that there are multiple facades working on this building. And this is a Southwest view, this is a southeast view looking over at the L shape orientation. \nSPEAKER_11:  And once again, just for reference, this is the view looking across Fourth Street at the building and how it's oriented with its relationship to the corner of Fourth and Temple. \nSPEAKER_11:  And finally, this is the view from Temple Avenue. One is on the right, that photo is going northbound on Temple Avenue. And on the left, that photo shows the closest facade to Temple Avenue, which currently features a window opening. And it is worth noting that the South elevation is a firewall for fire rating purposes. It has no openings, and it abuts a residential property to the South, which is addressed at 390 Temple Avenue. \nSPEAKER_11:  The applicant certificate of appropriateness request is for the authorization to paint two murals on the existing building and to repaint the body of the building to a different color. \nSPEAKER_11:  as proposed the murals would be on the north and west elevations of the building, which are substantially set back from East Forestry in Temple Avenue. \nSPEAKER_11:  There will be no physical alterations proposed to the existing commercial building beyond paint. \nSPEAKER_11:  The project before the CHC is regulated through the application of the Secretariat, the interior standards, and required findings for a certificate of appropriateness, which includes compatibility with the context of the historic district and existing structure on site. \nSPEAKER_11:  The content of artistic murals is protected by the First Amendment, and the CHC's purview is limited to the application of the Secretary, the Interior Standards, that will be discussed in these further slides and in the findings of the report. \nSPEAKER_11:  This slide is to try to articulate where the murals are going due to the L-shaped configuration of the lot. \nSPEAKER_11:  So. \nSPEAKER_11:  I want to just point out and name mural number one. Mural number one is the purple mural that is proposed on both the north and east facing elevate and north and west facing elevations. So you'll see here where mural number one is in purple and the different lines that is to illustrate where those that mural would be painted. \nSPEAKER_11:  Mural number two is a green mural and therefore that label is called out for that north two story elevation facing fourth three. \nSPEAKER_11:  In addition, the solid purple color would be on the one-story elevation closest to Temple Avenue. And then as discussed in the future, there is a condition of approval to paint the Southern elevation, which is along the South property line, along 390 Temple Avenue that abuts that site, to be painted a solid neutral color. \nSPEAKER_11:  This exhibit will be on other slides just for orientation purposes. \nSPEAKER_11:  This view shows mural number one and the solid purple elevation that I had discussed before. \nSPEAKER_11:  This view is from Temple Avenue. As you can see, the one-story portion of the building closest to Temple Avenue would be painted a muted purple color that corresponds to the other mural walls. \nSPEAKER_11:  this. \nSPEAKER_11:  Photo shows both mural number one and mural number two. So for a reference, mural number one was the purple mural. You'll see that it covers the one story and it peaks out from the two story portions of the North-facing elevation that you can see in the right-hand photo. \nSPEAKER_11:  Mural number two is the green mural that I had discussed previously, and that would be limited to the two-story north-facing elevation that would face Temple Ab. Um, 4th Street. \nSPEAKER_11:  For reference, this slide shows a previous submittal that was submitted by the applicant, and I wanted to go over some of the suggestions and recommendations offered by staff. There was a deeper and darker purple color proposed, and as such, it was asked that the color be made a more compatible and or more neutral color that is not as rich as the purple color that was previously proposed. \nSPEAKER_11:  Furthermore, the one story portion of the building closest to Temple Avenue was previously proposed as a mural, which would be mural number one. And staff asked that those mural areas were oriented more towards the commercial corridor of Fourth Street. And as such, the applicant has had revised that elevation to be the muted purple color. And so staff wanted to make sure that that is made aware to the commissioners today. \nSPEAKER_11:  Few special conditions have been placed on this application that I do want to go over. \nSPEAKER_11:  These are directly related to the proposed mural paint scheme that is proposed. \nSPEAKER_11:  First, the condition of approval number 6 is to require the applicant to coordinate with the adjacent property owner at 390 Temple Avenue for the paint color selection for the solid wall or the fire wall along the southern elevation. \nSPEAKER_11:  Rather than keeping the existing orange yellow color at this elevation, which is currently proposed as part of this application, that color would no longer be found on any other elevation of the building as proposed. So therefore, staff required that the applicant coordinate with the property owner to the south to choose a neutral tone color that is compatible with the residential character of the properties to the south. \nSPEAKER_11:  The final paint color shall be selected in concert with the property owner to the south and donkey documented on the final certificate of appropriateness for the project. This condition would ensure that the elevation most visible from the residential areas of the bluff heights historic district is more of a neutral color and does not represent \nSPEAKER_11:  a loud color at that South elevation. \nSPEAKER_11:  Secondly, a condition of approval will require that the final solid color selected for the one story, portion of the facade, along Temple Avenue, which is currently the muted purple color. \nSPEAKER_11:  would be carried through to at least one north elevation, whether that be the one-story elevation where the garage door looking windows are, or the two-story portion of the building that peaks out from the mural number two. \nSPEAKER_11:  This condition would ensure that the mural is framed by a more muted and solid primary color to bring some visual cohesion to the building and define the extent of the mural and ensure that it does not appear as though the entire building is covered with the proposed murals. \nSPEAKER_11:  For reference, this slide does show recent murals that were approved by the Cultural Heritage Commission, which were, those are landmark buildings. And those, both murals, it's worth noting were painted on elevations without character defining features on them. And those were both approved in one was in 2016 and one was in 2018. \nSPEAKER_11:  This is a slide that covers many of the secretaries, the interior standards. But what staff would like to point out is that specifically, the interior standards, number two and number ten are particularly important with this. With the proposed conditions, the murals are located to face the commercially-zoned street frontages and directed away from the more residential character of Temple Avenue to the subject site. \nSPEAKER_11:  This approach contains an oriental murals to the commercial area. And in this instance, the building is a non-contributing structure. And furthermore, the paint is reversible and would not affect the historic nature of the building, as paint can be painted over in the future if needed. \nSPEAKER_11:  As part of the findings that are included in your packet, there are findings that have been made in the affirmative related to the secretary to interior standards, the Bluff Heights Historic District Guidelines, and the Bluff Heights Historic District Ordnance as well as the requirements of the certificate of appropriateness findings. \nSPEAKER_11:  staff would like to reassert that this is a non-contributing building that has been modified from its original orientation and the applicant has proposed. \nSPEAKER_11:  murals and locations that orient away from the residential nature of the neighborhood and are more commercially oriented along the commercial corridor that is associated on the outskirts of retro row on the four-stream. \nSPEAKER_11:  As of this afternoon, 31 public comments have been received on the project and transmitted to the Cultural Heritage Commissioners. I would like to point out there is both support and opposition to the proposed murals and painting that is for this site. I would like to highlight there are a few themes and topics that were carried through. There were concerns related to the content of the murals, specifically mural number two, which is the green mural. There are concerns related to the color, the vibrancy of the colors used in the murals, including the vibrancy of the purple muted color along the temple avenue frontage. Current concerns also relate to the appropriateness of murals in historic districts, as well as the amount of building covered by the murals. In addition, without getting into detail, there is general support for the murals as proposed. \nSPEAKER_11:  And with that, \nSPEAKER_11:  staff has \nSPEAKER_11:  found that the required findings can be made in the affirmative as conditioned and recommends approval of the certificate of appropriateness subject to the conditions of approval before you \nSPEAKER_11:  This concludes staff's presentation, and the applicant is available for any questions you may have. \nSPEAKER_10:  Chairwoman Roosevelt, I believe you're muted. \nSPEAKER_10:  If you don't mind unmuting yourself. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you very much. I was just saying thank you for that excellent report. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  And um \nSPEAKER_07:  I also want to say welcome to the \nSPEAKER_07:  applicant who is here. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  Ask our commissioners if there are questions that you have for the applicant or comments or clarifications. \nSPEAKER_07:  regarding this project. \nSPEAKER_07:  Perhaps the applicant would like to present first to us. \nSPEAKER_14:  I believe the applicant is Amber Morris. If that's correct, Amber. \nSPEAKER_14:  You have been unmuted. Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_07:  Welcome. \nSPEAKER_17:  Hi, Michael for us is going to \nSPEAKER_17:  to be speaking on behalf of the project. \nSPEAKER_14:  Understood. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_14:  I find you in the list, Mr. Flores. \nSPEAKER_14:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_15:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_15:  I'm here. Thank you so much to the commission for giving us this time today. My name is Michael Forrest. I'm representing \nSPEAKER_15:  the dispensary of the lift. We are a small business looking to serve the community. We have submitted the proposal and the reason for the mural is to boost awareness, boost presence of our environment as well as being a cultural and vibrancy to the neighborhood. We selected the color purple on the facade, on this proposal because it symbolizes gender equality. In addition, the color purple and green together represent women's equality. \nSPEAKER_15:  And we were purposeful in ensuring that the murals only faced commercial corridors so that we did not take away from any of the residential areas of this area. \nSPEAKER_15:  It is our intent to enhance the neighborhood through our mural project. We recognize that this project has received mixed feedback by the community, both the support and opposition of. We are very appreciative and thankful for the dialogue we received from the staff and from the city to help us get to this point. Lastly, if deemed necessary by the commission, we are absolutely willing to adjust the design as we wish to be a welcome participant in the community as we do employ in the community and many of our teams live within the community as well. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Mr. Forrest. \nSPEAKER_07:  So commissioners. \nSPEAKER_07:  Are there any? \nSPEAKER_07:  questions or clarifications. \nSPEAKER_16:  I have a question. \nSPEAKER_16:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_16:  This is Commissioner Grasovsky. \nSPEAKER_16:  Um. \nSPEAKER_16:  But what is the significance of the abstract purple mural? I understand the green in your foot. \nSPEAKER_16:  to significance of that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  Sure, sorry about that. I was muted again. Yes, so the the artists that we chose for this mural is the same artists We use in some of our packaging of our product that we sell within our store And the name of this product is actually called one life the color purple in and of itself does represent gender equality and Our product you know specifically this product is catered towards that customer in that clientele And we would like to stand for something and be a welcoming part of the environment for everyone That is the significance of the color purple We specifically put a floral design to To enhance the femininity feminism of the design in coordination with the green \nSPEAKER_04:  Cheers. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  Um, you're all. \nSPEAKER_15:  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. \nSPEAKER_16:  but I was asking about the floral design. I couldn't tell what that was. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  fighting emotional around. \nSPEAKER_05:  the murals, over all, bring a lot of life to the sides. And I want to have... \nSPEAKER_05:  any right to \nSPEAKER_05:  to take any, I mean, they can consider, but how about the artist? \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, I mean, \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right, I'm in. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's an art supposition. I understand that he's... \nSPEAKER_05:  and business building. \nSPEAKER_05:  But overall, I think the approach of the artist is very fresh, very dynamic, and bring another energy to the side that is not offensive at all. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_17:  This is spice chair Irvine and I also \nSPEAKER_17:  Oh, very fond of both of these murals. I think that it's very appropriate for the East Village and for Long Beach in general. And I like the bright colors and the building itself as it was had nothing really to offer. \nSPEAKER_17:  And so I think this is a vast improvement. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good afternoon. This is Commissioner McGuan. \nSPEAKER_00:  And over the last few years, the city has made an effort to beautify the city with art and commission during certain phases of murals in and around downtown and other parts. \nSPEAKER_00:  At the time, it was unique and it added \nSPEAKER_00:  For \nSPEAKER_00:  talking points as well as the neighborhood itself. Probably that. \nSPEAKER_00:  And this mural here on Forrest Street, I know some of the neighbors. \nSPEAKER_00:  Voice that maybe this is not retro row, this is more residential and granted there was pros and cons but at the same time as I felt that \nSPEAKER_00:  As these murals are added, more and more people will... \nSPEAKER_00:  gain acceptance to this type of art. \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach is very unique and so much the cutting edge. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I would voice my support. \nSPEAKER_00:  and able to project. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hi, this is Commissioner Hunter. Sorry, I'm trying to show my video. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, echo. \nSPEAKER_03:  Exactly what. \nSPEAKER_03:  the previous commissioners have said with us being an art city. \nSPEAKER_03:  revitalizing and also recognizing the role of the artists in the community. And I'm not just speaking as a. \nSPEAKER_03:  of a person who's on the Arts Council or Long Beach. But this is exactly what we want to see. Buildings and property owners taking that initiative to. \nSPEAKER_03:  app the R2 these buildings so us and full support. \nSPEAKER_03:  and and thankful that this came before us. \nSPEAKER_09:  commissioners this is Patricia D even though for perhaps ask the commission to take the public comment that we can hear from the public and then and then have the deliberations of the commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think that's what the character was about. Would you like to invite the public to? \nSPEAKER_09:  We're \nSPEAKER_07:  We are very pleased to welcome any public comment at this time. \nSPEAKER_14:  That's my cue. We have \nSPEAKER_14:  Fair amount of members of the public soul. Maybe I'll go down the list. \nSPEAKER_14:  and sections here. \nSPEAKER_14:  alphabetically top to bottom. I have a banner or billy any comment in this application. \nSPEAKER_14:  No, no comment. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  There's also a few users on the phone. \nSPEAKER_14:  If you call there \nSPEAKER_14:  Your line is unmuted. Do you have any comment on this application? \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_14:  Hi. Do you have a comment? Hi, welcome. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, my name is Kathleen Brady and um \nSPEAKER_06:  I do not live in bloodhikes that I live in that neighborhood about six blocks from there and I'm often walking. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm very familiar with that corner there. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_06:  troubled by \nSPEAKER_06:  such a huge role on that little thing. \nSPEAKER_06:  I know it's non-contributing, but... \nSPEAKER_06:  Originally it was um \nSPEAKER_06:  allowed to have a second floor. \nSPEAKER_06:  in order to create a community safe for a rest drawn. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, the restaurant. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's good. \nSPEAKER_06:  community for a while and then they cashed out. But now, \nSPEAKER_06:  The second bar is finished at least. I mean, combining the first and second bar. \nSPEAKER_06:  So those are just huge murals and \nSPEAKER_06:  ? \nSPEAKER_06:  Can we, it's visually incompatible with \nSPEAKER_06:  You know the low-slung buildings and there's a couple Spanish old Spanish apartment buildings. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  further east on that block. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's just... \nSPEAKER_06:  It may get by cultural heritage criteria, but... \nSPEAKER_06:  I \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't know. \nSPEAKER_06:  The color scheme. \nSPEAKER_06:  So that neighborhood, this neighborhood, this area is very supportive of gender equality. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm really not sure. \nSPEAKER_06:  It needs to be. \nSPEAKER_06:  on that building in that way. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, the subject matter of the woman. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm not British and \nSPEAKER_06:  It would be lovely in a nightclub district. It really would. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would love it, but I don't love it there. \nSPEAKER_06:  So. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm pretty sure this has been a pass, but... \nSPEAKER_06:  pass your board and I understand the reasoning. \nSPEAKER_06:  However, \nSPEAKER_06:  Just a thought. \nSPEAKER_06:  That. \nSPEAKER_06:  Perhaps the honors. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we're a little more with. \nSPEAKER_06:  people in the neighborhoods that would like to see changes. I don't know. \nSPEAKER_06:  just an idea. \nSPEAKER_06:  And. \nSPEAKER_06:  One more. \nSPEAKER_06:  I, I, I too. \nSPEAKER_06:  Get on where Bix has been. Make you download the app and I didn't want to do that. \nSPEAKER_06:  So you talked about a couple contributing buildings that have \nSPEAKER_06:  Neural, so on them. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I don't know exactly which ones you mean, but I do have the photos, you know, on my phone here that were provided. \nSPEAKER_06:  by the city or provided any land the packet. \nSPEAKER_06:  and good. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  The building next to the \nSPEAKER_06:  The art theater, which is, you know, the facade was so nicely... \nSPEAKER_06:  Done. The center is next to it. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  Honestly, that's me, Earl. \nSPEAKER_06:  over the top of it. \nSPEAKER_06:  It really doesn't match with... \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  with retro row. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm sorry, there is a time limit. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um, Commissioner, sorry. Yeah, Chair Roosevelt. And if you want to remind the public of the two minute, the typical policy of a two minute time limit. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  But that was about 30 minutes. So yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you! \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  I apologize, we are very appreciative of your comments and we wanna hear from everyone. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I really thank you for making this call, but we do have a time limit. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm just not used to looking at it on my computer instead of. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you very much and I'm going to move to our next participant. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Okay, juby back on those colors on the line. Anyone else have a comment? They called in. \nSPEAKER_14:  in that moment. \nSPEAKER_14:  nothing heard commissioners I'm all down to. \nSPEAKER_14:  Donna, Donna, you didn't have a comment, please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you very much. I appreciate this opportunity. My name is Donna Sievers. I am the president of the Love Heights neighborhood Association, and I apologize with my my mistake. I didn't have enough time to fully \nSPEAKER_08:  uh, survey our entire neighborhood. So I'm speaking to you. \nSPEAKER_08:  on behalf of myself, not the entire neighborhood, but I think you may have heard from quite a few neighbors. \nSPEAKER_08:  I first want to say that I was very sorry to hear how much support \nSPEAKER_08:  The commissioners were already giving this project before we feel like we've had the appropriate time to make some additional comments to you. \nSPEAKER_08:  As I mentioned in my written comments, I am very opposed to the visual concept and the colors proposed in the summer. \nSPEAKER_08:  Well, I do believe that as our prior \nSPEAKER_08:  resident mentioned. \nSPEAKER_08:  Do believe the artist work with the appropriate and museum or gallery. \nSPEAKER_08:  However, I do not think a large painting in a building is the appropriate place for a young woman who in my opinion is being exploited to bring in customers to the lift. \nSPEAKER_08:  The mural portrays a woman, but Asian background, who is also happens to be \nSPEAKER_08:  My daughter's background. \nSPEAKER_08:  who although she is dressed, she is showing her breasts while she is stroking her cleavage. \nSPEAKER_08:  The artist, Amadeline, in her bio says, and I'll quote, she depicts strong seductive women and illustrates their strength, unquote, and she goes on. \nSPEAKER_08:  I had hoped that our social justice movement had moved to the point where women do not have to be seductive in order to show their strength. \nSPEAKER_08:  And while I certainly support First Amendment rights, there's a difference, a clear difference in First Amendment rights and the painting of a large \nSPEAKER_08:  mural on a building that shows a very young woman stroking her breast in my opinion. \nSPEAKER_08:  I would like to read you a quote by Joey Lee in the undergraduate journal of contemporary connections dated 2018. \nSPEAKER_08:  The author is quoted by saying one underlying representation of East Asian women in Western media and culture is the Dainty Chinatall or the diminutive butterfly. \nSPEAKER_08:  the Dossal archetype in fantasizes and hypersexualizes the diverse communities of people of Asian descent and unquote. \nSPEAKER_08:  Later in the paper, the author continues to say, \nSPEAKER_08:  that the portrayal of East Asian women is hypersexual and commodified. \nSPEAKER_08:  I would submit to you that this is actually exactly what this mural does. It come out. I'm going to show you guys about your unmute. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  I said that it commodifies and hyper-sensual. \nSPEAKER_07:  We did hear you, but what I was going to say is, unfortunately, we have now. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  moved into, we've gone beyond your time. \nSPEAKER_07:  but I thank you for your comments. And I want to make sure that we have time for other participants as well. \nSPEAKER_14:  Isaac, did you have any comments, Mr. Sorgato? \nSPEAKER_17:  Nah, I don't \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Moving along, Janus Theater if I show you log in twice, let me try \nSPEAKER_14:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  my husband. \nSPEAKER_02:  my head's in his vlog. \nSPEAKER_14:  boys. \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'd like to defer my time to him. \nSPEAKER_14:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're the owners of the 390 temple. \nSPEAKER_14:  We're the only \nSPEAKER_14:  I will. \nSPEAKER_14:  Would you like to? \nSPEAKER_14:  I don't know if I switched the user or this is fine. \nSPEAKER_12:  No, that's fine. I'm on all cell. \nSPEAKER_14:  We can hear you, please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_12:  Can you hear me okay? \nSPEAKER_14:  Yes sir, please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay, first of all, I want to thank you for the opportunity to express my concerns. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm Bob Beardorf. I'm a 45-year owner of the adjacent property. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  I've \nSPEAKER_12:  lived in Long Beach Road. \nSPEAKER_12:  moved along beach in 1977. I met my wife here. I've grown up there. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  and I'm not just some Shmack-Owns-EJs in property, I've got invested interest in the community. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm a long time owner. \nSPEAKER_12:  of the property there. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um. \nSPEAKER_12:  And I do you guys have got a tough decision. \nSPEAKER_12:  but I think there's some blurring factors that cannot be overlooked. \nSPEAKER_12:  I know that the... \nSPEAKER_12:  the cultural history. \nSPEAKER_12:  Commission. \nSPEAKER_12:  is purposed to protect and enhance. \nSPEAKER_12:  Pet your weight. \nSPEAKER_12:  The reminders of past eras, the architectural styles of the past. \nSPEAKER_12:  And \nSPEAKER_12:  to provide future generations with significant examples. \nSPEAKER_12:  from past generation. \nSPEAKER_12:  So we need to question. \nSPEAKER_12:  the subject of the mural and how that fits. \nSPEAKER_12:  and Donna points out. \nSPEAKER_12:  This is \nSPEAKER_12:  far more seductive or far more sexual \nSPEAKER_12:  then I think it needs to be. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_12:  I do not think that it's... \nSPEAKER_12:  It really portrays the history. \nSPEAKER_12:  or the culture. \nSPEAKER_12:  and I'm questioning then. \nSPEAKER_12:  what is the appropriateness and how does that fit? \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  end. \nSPEAKER_12:  Uh... \nSPEAKER_12:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_12:  where is the cultural significance? \nSPEAKER_12:  And where is the historical value? \nSPEAKER_12:  shouldn't fact \nSPEAKER_12:  the address shouldn't that be answered? \nSPEAKER_12:  before we approve this. \nSPEAKER_12:  that if it has no... \nSPEAKER_12:  cultural significance and has no historical value. \nSPEAKER_12:  Why is this being approved? \nSPEAKER_12:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm also. I just feel like I'm just. \nSPEAKER_07:  I just for let you show there 20 more seconds left in your time to make it come. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm so concerned about the color palette. You know, you have made a statement. \nSPEAKER_12:  First of all, my wife has deferred her time to me, so I think I should have been allowed a little extra time. \nSPEAKER_12:  and I'm also the adjacent property owner, so I am mostly impacted. \nSPEAKER_12:  by more than anybody. \nSPEAKER_12:  by what's going on here. \nSPEAKER_12:  and i think i need to show the show just a little bit of extra consideration because i'm being impacted \nSPEAKER_12:  very, very much. \nSPEAKER_12:  Ha ha! \nSPEAKER_07:  I would agree to you that it's very important and I hear you and also I think you should go ahead and take your wife's time. Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay. So please. \nSPEAKER_07:  So please continue to reach comments. \nSPEAKER_12:  I really do appreciate your consideration. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  So. \nSPEAKER_12:  I think we need to address for a moment just the color palette. \nSPEAKER_12:  because my home is 100 years old and it's a California style. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  up. \nSPEAKER_12:  Crashman home. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm required to adhere to a particular color palette. \nSPEAKER_12:  that. \nSPEAKER_12:  my adjacent \nSPEAKER_12:  neighbor. \nSPEAKER_12:  the property. \nSPEAKER_12:  severe progress in climate change.ower \nSPEAKER_12:  consideration here. \nSPEAKER_12:  does not have to hold to simply because he's in a non-conforming \nSPEAKER_12:  piece of property. \nSPEAKER_12:  So the question really needs to be made. \nSPEAKER_12:  to be asked, the larger issue is \nSPEAKER_12:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_12:  color code is \nSPEAKER_12:  If... \nSPEAKER_12:  A color code and it's here for a purpose. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_12:  your \nSPEAKER_12:  staff report. \nSPEAKER_12:  Stay. \nSPEAKER_12:  on paragraph 9 of page 4. \nSPEAKER_12:  under the heading of analysis. \nSPEAKER_12:  in the middle of the paragraph it states. \nSPEAKER_12:  it has been determined. \nSPEAKER_12:  that the project would not detract from the residential character of the area. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  nor of the historical integrity of the district. \nSPEAKER_12:  What the statement? \nSPEAKER_12:  is simply as false. \nSPEAKER_12:  No. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm not intending to call somebody out here. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm simply trying to point out an error in logic. \nSPEAKER_12:  All right. \nSPEAKER_12:  Let me explain. \nSPEAKER_12:  Philosophy 101 says \nSPEAKER_12:  that if an argument is to be held true, it has to be held true in all cases. \nSPEAKER_12:  if it's to be false, it only needs to be proven false in one case. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. I have to let you know that your time is up. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I very much appreciate your comments and hearing from you. \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Are there any other participants? \nSPEAKER_14:  Are there any other participants? \nSPEAKER_14:  any comments? \nSPEAKER_01:  Hello, could you guys hear me? \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, we can. \nSPEAKER_17:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to thank you guys for your time. Not only am I a resident of the city of Long Beach, I am actually the manager of the lift as well. We have gotten tons of feedback and people really excited to see what this is going to bring to the community. I myself personally think that with the new generations going on, a lot of people are looking for mules to post on social media, which will bring in tons of revenue to the city. I think the bright colors go in line with Retro Row. Just two blocks down, Lola's Cafe is a bright orange and right next door to it. It's a very bright pink, beautiful color building. I also feel that the mural of the lady represents \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, just the beauty of people, gender equality. So thank you guys for your time and I'm really excited to see where this goes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Should we move ahead? \nSPEAKER_14:  these. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you for your patience. Mariela, did you have a comment or Michael? \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, I think that's a bit... \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  I can do that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Why? You want to talk? \nSPEAKER_14:  If there's no comment, I'll go ahead and move on. \nSPEAKER_14:  I also show... \nSPEAKER_14:  of Michael Forrest, that was the last person on the list. \nSPEAKER_15:  Yes, I just wanted to thank the commission for their time and for their thoughtful consideration. Again, our goal is to work with the community and to work with the commission and I just want to reiterate that. \nSPEAKER_15:  One, the female in the painting is not Asian. \nSPEAKER_15:  doesn't even look Asian in our opinion. But the colors that we selected were purposefully intended to convey female equality and the strength of the female gender. And our customers embrace it. And one of the triggers for the mural was that the beauty of inside the store isn't being represented outside the store. And we will absolutely, if the committee teams necessary, we are willing to adjust the design as you see fit. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Mr. Forils. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is that our last participant comment? \nSPEAKER_14:  That is everyone. I'm going to show. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, are there any any comments or \nSPEAKER_07:  Questions or statements from the commissioners? \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm just going to scroll through. I can't see all of you. \nSPEAKER_07:  on one page. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_17:  I'll come in one more time. As far as the content. \nSPEAKER_17:  I believe that our purview does not cover that. \nSPEAKER_17:  reviews strictly has to do with \nSPEAKER_17:  historic significance and as this building is \nSPEAKER_17:  not historic. \nSPEAKER_17:  I think that \nSPEAKER_17:  Our purview is only whether we feel that it would be \nSPEAKER_17:  appropriate to put a mural on a building that is. \nSPEAKER_17:  and learn how to meses and sometimes \nSPEAKER_17:  Correct me if I'm not. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Commissioner, this is Patricia Diefendorf, and I'll invite the city attorney to add to the comments as she wishes that yes, I mean, as we established in the support. Yeah, the content of the mural is not what's before us. The mural is allowed by the coast and the content is protected by the First Amendment rights and really what is the for us is whether it is appropriate in light of the fact that it's in the historic district. It is a non-contributing building. It is at the outskirts. It is at the edge, the North Ali. \nSPEAKER_09:  most of the district and the murals have been, you know, with guidance from staff and through conditions have been oriented towards the commercial corridor away from the residential to try to make accommodations for \nSPEAKER_09:  concerns about the mural kind of intruding into the neighborhood, the residential neighborhood. So that's kind of... \nSPEAKER_09:  you know, the guidance that we can offer you and it's really, I think, you know, the commission just has to sort of weigh the Secretary of Interior standards as it relates to this project. \nSPEAKER_09:  If it's helpful, we can put the slide back up that lists the standards and that kind of like identifies the ones that are really \nSPEAKER_09:  to remain in this situation. \nSPEAKER_07:  That might be helpful also for. \nSPEAKER_07:  Everyone to see one more time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  there. We're meeting with the city attorney's office. I think Patricia's guidance is exactly what I would have suggested and I do think it's helpful to go and return the analysis to the secretary of interior standards. And I think that we've got that slide back up. \nSPEAKER_10:  And I think that's an accurate statement. Our focus is not on the content of the mural. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  from a First Amendment right perspective that we're really looking at compliance with that Secretary of Interior standard. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I thank you both very much and I think that you've definitely clarified. \nSPEAKER_07:  what our job on this commission is. \nSPEAKER_07:  at this time. Are there any other comments from other commissioners? \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, if not, then I would like to. \nSPEAKER_07:  have a motion. \nSPEAKER_07:  or recommendation to approve. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_17:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_17:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_17:  I swear, Irvine, I'll make a motion. \nSPEAKER_07:  And do I have a second? \nSPEAKER_05:  Ya i\u011fen ga? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  followed by the standard without interruption in terms of the content of the mural as an active swine. \nSPEAKER_09:  commissioners. Can I do this is Patricia do you feel no free I can't clarify that the motion \nSPEAKER_09:  is to approve the staff recommendation. Can you just please stay on the record and clarify that? \nSPEAKER_09:  What the motion is? \nSPEAKER_17:  Okay, I approve, I motion to approve the project with the conditions that staff has required. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_17:  without any other changes. \nSPEAKER_17:  That's not good enough. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Would you like me to read it? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  it that's that's sufficient just wanted to be clear on the record thank you \nSPEAKER_07:  it. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_09:  and thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_05:  and close your round second. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Commissioner Ramos and \nSPEAKER_07:  May we please have a roll call vote? \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Ramos. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes, Mr. McGon. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Mr. Hunter. \nSPEAKER_13:  You're on mute. Commissioner Hunter? \nSPEAKER_03:  Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Hines. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_16:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Mission Agressaphic. \nSPEAKER_16:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_13:  Vice Chair Irvine. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  and chair Roosevelt. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  I \nSPEAKER_07:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you commissioners and thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  when in the public. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have."
