This presentation \nSPEAKER_03:  on the budget outlook study session given to City Council on March 16th. \nSPEAKER_03:  and provides more detail on the general fund revenue and expense trends as was the out-ear implications. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_03:  As a reminder, the FYI budget was adopted before employee contract negotiations were complete. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the budget did not include funding for these potential costs as they were unknown at that time. \nSPEAKER_03:  It was noted in the budget book that any costs negotiated for FY20 required the city to identify and use one time funds and that the structural impact needed to be incorporated into the FY21 budget projections. \nSPEAKER_03:  When negotiations were complete, estimated costs of about 10 to 12 million were unfunded. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  Then the pandemic hit and the fiscal situation became even more strained. \nSPEAKER_03:  The final shortfall for the General Fund at the end of FY20 was 21 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  This was better than initial projections, which estimated a potential shortfall of 25 to 41 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks to incredible staff effort to maximize grants and scaleback costs, as well as revenues that did not perform as negatively as originally thought they potentially could under the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ultimately to cover this shortfall, we used almost all of the 13.5 million operating reserve and 7.9 million of the emergency reserve. \nSPEAKER_03:  For the operating reserve, this brings us to essentially 0% of normal operating expenditures, which is below the minimum of 2% and the maximum of 7% per the city's financial policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  For the emergency reserve, we are now at about 6.9% of normal operating expenditures, which is below the minimum of 8% and the target level of 10%. \nSPEAKER_03:  This use of reserves in FY20 was very appropriate as they were intended to be used in these types of emergency situations. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  use and until reserves are restored, the city is in a much weaker position in terms of being able to respond to future disasters such as earthquakes. \nSPEAKER_03:  or avoid major service disruptions during another crisis. \nSPEAKER_03:  Fortunately, part of the city's plan for the American Rescue Plan Act funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  is to replenish these reserves and others that have been used or is anticipated to be used because of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  The budget for the current fiscal year FY21 was developed during this pandemic crisis, with the projected structural shortfall of 30 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  This shortfall was reserved through a combination of structural and one-time solutions, including in-employed furloughs and even more use of reserves. An estimated 5 million to cover the structural shortfall gap, and another 3 million to cover one-time needs. \nSPEAKER_03:  This was the first time in many years that one times were utilized to balance a structural shortfall. And while this is not in line with our financial policies, this approach was recommended in order to address as many needs as possible and take a long-term view of the multiple challenges we were facing as a city. \nSPEAKER_03:  There are some positive early indicators that some key revenues will perform better than what has been budgeted in FY21. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we will also be restoring services impacted by furloughs through the use of federal funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks a lot. \nSPEAKER_03:  The projection for FY22 is a shortfall of 30 million. This includes some of the structural shortfall that existed previously in FY21, but carried over into FY22 as it was solved with one-time solutions, as I've mentioned before. \nSPEAKER_03:  It also includes the 1.9 million for the fire department's reduction in FY 21 that was addressed with one times, but where structural ongoing solution has not yet been identified. \nSPEAKER_03:  In our general fund out love, we are also currently assuming that there will be a favorable outcome regarding the measure and litigation. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is because there was a similar case in Sacramento that had a favorable court ruling, indicating a potentially positive outcome for Long Beach as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  If this is not the case, our projection would be worse by 9 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  The potential fiscal impacts related to the measure and litigation will be described further in the next presentation and agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  The American Rescue Plan funding gives the city the opportunity to provide relief and recovery in FY22 to support for residents and businesses and allow the city the ability to maintain services. \nSPEAKER_03:  With these funds, the FY22 shortfall, previously 30 million is now resolved. \nSPEAKER_03:  So what does this mean for the out years? You can see that the FY23 shortfall, which was previously $7 million is now $37 million, as a shortfall on FY22 is now shifted into FY23. \nSPEAKER_03:  It is important to note that the underlying structural deficit still exists in FY22, where the structural revenue is less than the structural expense, creating the shortfall. \nSPEAKER_03:  And FY22, while that structural shortfall situation exists, it is being covered on a one-time basis with the federal funds. When the federal funds are gone, we will still be left with a shortfall to resolve as a city. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_03:  This slide shows the revenue drivers contributing to the FY22 shortfall situation. The incremental change amount from the FY21 adopted budget is shown. As you can see, overall revenue projections are increasing. \nSPEAKER_03:  However, as you will see on the next slide, expense increases are growing at a faster pace than revenue. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just to highlight some of the incremental changes in the revenue budget, FY22, we have the Uplands Oil Transfer. \nSPEAKER_03:  currently increasing by 1.3 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just as a reminder, during the pandemic, oil prices and FY20 dropped to unprecedented levels. And at one point was even negative. \nSPEAKER_03:  The projection for FY21 assumes the price of oil to be $35 per barrel. \nSPEAKER_03:  But prices this year have been very good at around $60 a barrel recently. FY22 is currently assumed at $45 a barrel, but we will be evaluating this again based on most up-to-date information before the FY22 proposed budget is finalized. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that comment is true for all of the other revenue projections as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  We will be evaluating all of this again based on new information and updating them one more time before finalizing the proposed budget. \nSPEAKER_03:  Moving on to property tax, it's estimated to increase by 5.4 million. We're anticipating positive growth and assessed valuation, but we'll also be monitoring any lagging impacts of the pandemic, the valuations, and the out years. \nSPEAKER_03:  Transient occupancy tax charged on hotel and motel room stays is anticipated to increase by 2.8 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  This includes projected revenues from measure B, which increase the TOT portion to the general fund by 1%. \nSPEAKER_03:  TOT is an extremely volatile revenue source, heavily dependent on convention and business meetings, and has been very heavily impacted throughout FY20 by significant reductions in occupancy. \nSPEAKER_03:  due to travel and social distancing restrictions and response to the pandemic. We've had about a 40% loss compared to budget and FY20. \nSPEAKER_03:  We are anticipating summer recovery into FY21, and I've adjusted the FY21 budget to reflect the lower revenues, and also now anticipating some growth from that point in FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  Recovery back to pre-pandemic levels is anticipated to take several years. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sales tax and measure A. \nSPEAKER_03:  have been performing better than what was initially anticipated during the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  There have been losses in restaurant hotels and general consumer goods, but these losses have been mitigated by steady performance in sectors such as autos and transportation, in gains in food and drugs, including cannabis sales. \nSPEAKER_03:  significant help in revenue has also come from increased online sales and new revenue from countywide sales tax pool. \nSPEAKER_03:  further increased by online shopping through the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  All of this has led to. \nSPEAKER_03:  projection increase for both sales tax and measure A in FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  The utility user's tax is a 5% tax on usage of water, telephone, electric utilities. \nSPEAKER_03:  and is projected to decline by 2.1 million in FY22. A significant portion of this is the telephone user's tax revenue. \nSPEAKER_03:  which are anticipated to decline as part of the continued erosion and wired revenues due to limited number of new subscribers in a highly competitive price market. \nSPEAKER_03:  And other revenues include other citywide revenues in various departmental items. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  This slide shows the incremental changes in the expense budget for FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  Salary-related cost at an increase of $22.9 million is the largest expense driver. This includes all the negotiated cost raises for FY22, as well as some of the raises that were given on FY21, but not completed in time to be included in the 21 adopted budget. \nSPEAKER_03:  The insurance fund increased totals 8.6 million. It is one of our most significant cost drivers this year. GraphY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  The majority of this is general liability cost increases at 7 million. General liability. \nSPEAKER_03:  liability claims, settlement and judgment costs have risen in recent years, as well as insurance premiums. This has all had an adverse impact on our budgetary funds available, which ended FY20 in a negative balance. \nSPEAKER_03:  This increase is to help bring back the fund into balance and restore cash to a reasonable level. \nSPEAKER_03:  Alper's costs are also increasing at 2.4 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  However, compared to previous years, this rate of increase is much less. This is partly to be expected as the city is on a path to pay down its unfunded liabilities. And the projected pattern is that wall costs will continue to increase for several years. \nSPEAKER_03:  The rate of increase will begin to taper and slow. \nSPEAKER_03:  The Civic Center MOU is also impacting costs with an increase of 1.3 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  The Civic Center Fund, which is used to maintain, improve and operate the Civic Center complex. \nSPEAKER_03:  has recently had unbudgeted expenses that include an agreement with the port for unbudgeted licensing, eSnet, parking facility, and data room costs located in the port building. \nSPEAKER_03:  Additionally, Civic Center Security MLU expenses and citywide indirect cost plan overhead expenses have contributed to unfunded costs. \nSPEAKER_03:  This increases anticipated to help bring the fund back into balance. \nSPEAKER_03:  Critical technology needs and other technology-related MOU costs is an increase of about 1.9 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is related to new and increased maintenance. \nSPEAKER_03:  and license costs for technology investments. \nSPEAKER_03:  primarily the critical needs and the technology plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  as well as increased lease financing costs for additional PC replacements that are planned for non-city hall departments. \nSPEAKER_03:  Health-related benefit costs was actually a savings of 1.9 in the budget. In general, health care costs have had a positive trend over the past few years. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city's health plan renewals have consistently been lower than health care inflation trend. \nSPEAKER_03:  And also this past year during the pandemic, we saw costs drop. \nSPEAKER_03:  because of a lower usage trend, which was seen across the healthcare market. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is anticipated to rebound as the pandemic passes. \nSPEAKER_03:  but there were some identified budgetary savings to better align budget to current cost projections. \nSPEAKER_03:  Other expenses include a variety of items such as debt service, the city's indirect cost plan, other MOUs and technical budget carry corrections. \nSPEAKER_03:  And lastly, the 1.7 million set aside is for future programming of the measure US and measure BTOT funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  This slide shows the additional factors that go into calculating the bottom line shortfall number. \nSPEAKER_03:  We start with our incremental revenue and expense impact as noted in the previous slides. \nSPEAKER_03:  We then have an additional head of 4.2 million of previous year shortfall that was not resolved. \nSPEAKER_03:  1.9 million of structural cuts assigned to fire, but where specific solutions have not yet been identified. \nSPEAKER_03:  We also need to back out 6 million of revenue related to measure A, incremental increase, as measure A is accounted for separately. \nSPEAKER_03:  and setting aside funds related to the measure-beastabilization. \nSPEAKER_03:  In total, we get the 30 million shortfall projected for FY22, which is anticipated to be covered by the American relief and an act federal funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  And also as a reminder, if measure ad litigation is not favorable, 9 million would need to be added to this shortfall. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  The resources and flexibility provided by the Federal Fund's excellent news for the city as it provides much needed relief for FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  and allows the city more time needed to make thoughtful plans for the future. \nSPEAKER_03:  However, it is important to note that there are significant uncertainties and unfunded critical needs that still remain. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're still waiting for additional clarifications on any of the regulations surrounding the use of the federal funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're waiting to find out the outcome and impact of the measure and litigation, which we'll talk about in our next agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  There are still unfunded critical means, both one time and structural. And lastly, there is still uncertainty as to how the economy will continue to react and recover post pandemic, which may impact our projections either positively or negatively. \nSPEAKER_03:  For strategic planning purposes, we're developing contingencies and options to be prepared to be ready to deal with these uncertainties as necessary. \nSPEAKER_03:  And lastly, throughout the upcoming year, we will need to make it a high priority to develop a plan to address future structural shortfalls when one time funding is not available to cover the gap. \nSPEAKER_03:  That concludes my presentation and I am available to answer questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Grace, for the very, very candid straightforward and impactful. \nSPEAKER_05:  Information always appreciated from \nSPEAKER_05:  The Financial Services Bureau. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  I did have just a couple of comments that jumped out at me from your presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, it's pretty, pretty, uh, \nSPEAKER_05:  alarming to the sea. \nSPEAKER_05:  But these numbers, but \nSPEAKER_05:  what we've experienced over the last year has been just alarming numbers and a lot of uncertainty. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think our picture. \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, and I'll, I'll look with our city finances is becoming more clear. I'm very thankful that we have \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, help coming from the federal government to help us. \nSPEAKER_05:  restore our \nSPEAKER_05:  are reserves and obviously, you know, \nSPEAKER_05:  contributed to the health and \nSPEAKER_05:  We're recovery for our city related to \nSPEAKER_05:  funds that can be used over the next fiscal year to \nSPEAKER_05:  to restore services, to get our city healthier, but also healthier financially as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, obviously we know that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  FY22 we will we will breathe a little easier for this budget cycle. \nSPEAKER_05:  But, you know, obviously we're already planning and have serious concerns for the next budget cycle and so. \nSPEAKER_05:  anything I would just say to this committee anything that we can do. \nSPEAKER_05:  to to to to big board and \nSPEAKER_05:  and uh \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I guess less in the pain for future years, particularly FY23, which we know is staring us in the face today. \nSPEAKER_05:  We still have to get through the FY22 budget, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  We need to be paid. I'm mindful of that. I'll move it forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think one of the surprising factors here was the \nSPEAKER_05:  The low renewal rate, I guess, for healthcare costs, it seems like \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, there's a silver lining at that. \nSPEAKER_05:  is a cost that just typically \nSPEAKER_05:  a lot higher. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's managing itself. That as well as \nSPEAKER_05:  our CalPERS expenses as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Those are just my initial comments. I'd like to open it up to the floor for. \nSPEAKER_05:  My colleagues. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  Council Member Vice Chair Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  Do you have anything? \nSPEAKER_01:  I think Council Member Uronga is now the vice chair. So I do have a question. Oh, one. I'm so separate. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, one. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm so separate. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's okay, I'll defer to him if he has any questions and then I'll go after. \nSPEAKER_06:  I only had one question on slide seven. \nSPEAKER_06:  Expense and criminal changes we have a one right there on the \nSPEAKER_06:  insurance fund. \nSPEAKER_06:  and 7 million out of that 8.6 was for \nSPEAKER_06:  general liability. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is that consistent with what we've had in the past or is this? \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm not here where it's a little higher than other years or \nSPEAKER_06:  or is it consistent? \nSPEAKER_03:  I committee member, Yoronga, thank you for that question. This is higher. This particular increase amount reflected in the FY22 projection. \nSPEAKER_03:  is significantly higher than in past years. What has happened in the past years is that costs have risen for settlement payouts and also just the industry as a whole has been following a trend where premiums are much more expensive and cost are rising nationwide. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so while general liabilities have been a factor in every year, \nSPEAKER_03:  This is a particularly large one to try to address some of the losses that we've experienced over the past couple years with the large settlement claims and increase premium costs. \nSPEAKER_06:  what kind of a gift in general? \nSPEAKER_06:  What types of claims have we had to pay out as an example? \nSPEAKER_03:  In general, there are like public safety claims are police related or other public safety claims large settlement claims. I don't have like specific ones that have. \nSPEAKER_06: \ufffd \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  He hit Barung. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  yeah \nSPEAKER_04:  Public safety, public works and parks. \nSPEAKER_03:  Friday. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then those claims combined with increased premium costs have a \nSPEAKER_03:  I've contributed to. \nSPEAKER_03:  are fund having an adverse impact in terms of cash. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, I noticed while I was a member of the EDNF that we were also paying out quite a bit on workers comp. \nSPEAKER_06:  workers' complaints. Is that also a significant factoring there? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, workers claims are part of this, the $8 million number that you see. It is our less, however, than the general liability. We are monitoring workers' compensation costs closely, but the more significant driver has been general liability. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you, that's all I have, Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, and I think it was an excellent question. That's a... \nSPEAKER_05:  area that we could probably \nSPEAKER_05:  to dig a little deeper on. \nSPEAKER_05:  with future BLC meetings just to kind of understand how we can \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  or \nSPEAKER_05:  given \nSPEAKER_05:  Ask our city manager, city management to. \nSPEAKER_05:  what we can do to improve on those numbers and bring them down. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councilmember. \nSPEAKER_05:  Suzy Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  House of Liberal Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  with this. \nSPEAKER_05:  You're on it. \nSPEAKER_02:  I am with you. I'm trying to turn my camera on. There we go. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you very much for that presentation and thank you chair for this item. I had a couple of questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  What are our current reserves if we don't account for the federal assistance monies? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, absolutely. Thank you, committee members. Looking for my... \nSPEAKER_03:  mute button. So before FY20 ended, we had about 13.5 million in our operating reserve. \nSPEAKER_03:  And with the impact of the FY20 shortfall, we have about 900,000 remaining there. That's essentially just half of our measure B that's required to remain because we're not allowed to use all of measure B in one year. \nSPEAKER_03:  So essentially for our operating reserves, if you don't factor in the replenishment of that reserve with federal funds, we're essentially depleted in our operating reserve. Then we also had our emergency reserve. \nSPEAKER_03:  which started FY20 with 46 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we are using about 7.9 of that, 7.9 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so about 38 million is remaining in the emergency reserve, which is about about 7%. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, and do we have any indication at all or when will we know whether we can use some of the federal relief monies to pay down our reserves or whether there's any constraints related to that? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, thank you for that question. At the moment, we don't. \nSPEAKER_03:  We don't think that there are any constraints with that as this seems to be aligned with the impact of the pandemic and some of the \nSPEAKER_03:  the parameters that have been released on the federal funds. So currently that is part of our plan to replenish our reserves. We are just waiting for any further guidance to see if that would change our current thinking. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that guy is scheduled by May 15th. \nSPEAKER_02:  Excellent. Thank you. That was my follow up question. It's on slide three. The term are our weaker position is used. Does that have anything to do with our credit ratings? I know there was a TFF that came out during the pandemic regarding our credit rating. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm not sure if that's because we dipped into our reserves or, you know, what the term weaker position refers to. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, it's both of those. If we did not have federal funds to replenish our reserves and we were below our recommended level from our fiscal policy, that is something our credit rating agencies look at to see are we maintaining our reserves at what level, how much security do we have? Are we implementing good financial practices? \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I think John can speak more to this if you'd like, but we were put on a watch. \nSPEAKER_03:  So our credit rating was not downgraded, but because of the use of the reserves we were put on a watch. \nSPEAKER_03:  just kind of as a warning. \nSPEAKER_03:  of the direction that we're going. And so that's really what part of what this meant is in a weaker condition, but also just in general, if we have lesser reserves, if we face challenges in the future like an earthquake. \nSPEAKER_03:  or we have another \nSPEAKER_03:  situation that requires us to have operating funds that are needed on a one-time basis. We just have less funding available to support us in those emergency situations. \nSPEAKER_03:  So both those factors combined. \nSPEAKER_03:  would put us in a weaker financial situation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and I think I personally became very concerned when I saw that notification for the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  And when I've articulated that to people, they've said, oh, well, a lot of other cities have the same thing happen. Do we know if that's true that as a result of the pandemic and cities having to dip into reserves and be more creative with their available revenues, whether other cities were put on a watch list and have to be mindful of that? \nSPEAKER_04:  We don't have specific information on that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would imagine that there are many cities across the country that are similar, so I suspect that those comments are probably correct. \nSPEAKER_04:  the two things that are being looked at. \nSPEAKER_04:  that the rating agency's most emphasized is what she reserved level and are you structurally balanced. And hopefully we will be replenishing our reserves if we can. We are not structurally balanced and we have not made any steps to be structurally balanced. And that is we'll see how the rating agencies react to that, whether they \nSPEAKER_04:  agree that that's a short term thing or whether it is their opinion. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we should have done more in FY22 to be structurally balanced. We really don't know how they will respond. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you for that, Drone. That's helpful. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm wondering if you can give just a little bit more explanation on slide number five. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm not quite understanding. \nSPEAKER_02:  the FY22 and FY23 numbers and how FY23 is jumping up to 37 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  shortfall with the federal funds. So \nSPEAKER_02:  If you could help me with a little bit of that, I'd appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, absolutely. Committee member price. \nSPEAKER_03:  So the numbers that are shown on that slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  can be confusing because they are not cumulative, they are incremental. \nSPEAKER_03:  So essentially if we just look at that first table, the one that shows the scenario without federal funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's projecting that an FY22, we have a short fall of 30 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  assuming that we \nSPEAKER_03:  structurally fix that 30 million. Let's just say we either find new revenues of 30 million or we cut expenses by 30 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  Then in FY23, we have an additional problem of 7 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  So what the federal with federal fund scenario is showing. \nSPEAKER_03:  is that we're essentially seeing we don't have a problem in FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  because we're covering that. \nSPEAKER_03:  issue on a one time basis, it's like getting a one time credit for the problem that we have. But in reality, that problem wasn't funded and solved on an ongoing basis. So that problem still exists, and because we did not solve it in 22, \nSPEAKER_03:  from a structural viewpoint that problem now in 2337. It's cumulative. \nSPEAKER_03:  for that second year. \nSPEAKER_04:  And can I make another example of that? \nSPEAKER_04:  The type I like to use is imagine you have a home budget and you're spending $7,000 a year more than you make, but your cousin sends you $3,000 check us a gift and your balance for that year. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bet you! \nSPEAKER_04:  In fact, for spending $3,000 a year more than your earn, and then next year that problem got worse by $700. And you didn't solve it. So now you have the $700 from FY22, but $3,000. \nSPEAKER_04:  that you didn't solve an FY21 and you end up with a 37. \nSPEAKER_04:  $3700 or in the RK's $37 million dollars. You have to solve the problem that you're spending more than your earn. And we're not doing that on FY22. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. That's a really, both of you guys gave really good examples. And I like the household example analogy. I use that a lot because it helps me put into context our, our policies and practices a little bit better when you analogize it to what you're doing at home. And, you know, \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  talk about things you probably would never do at home because you don't have the money to do it, but yeah, sometimes we do take risks on. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think the question that I have is. \nSPEAKER_02:  in regards to \nSPEAKER_02:  So the federal spending is really just a band-aid of sorts and then we're just going to have to figure out some policies to be able to take care of some of these structural problems that we are continuing to perhaps spend more money on than we can afford. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's correct. Yes. And it was. \nSPEAKER_03:  that balance of having it be a pause year so we can recover the community and the residents can recover from the pandemic without further service cuts. \nSPEAKER_03:  at the same time acknowledging that it's still an underlying problem. \nSPEAKER_02:  One other question, and that was in regards to slide number six, other revenue change, and you have several examples listed. Cannabis, VLF, transfers, and departmental. Do you know what percentage of that was cannabis? I know that when we were having the discussions about cannabis a few years ago, our projections of how much revenue we would get from cannabis was a lot higher than the 2.5 million. And cannabis seems to be just one of the sources of this additional positive revenue. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I know that cannabis industry \nSPEAKER_02:  it generally speaking did did pretty well during the COVID pandemic. So what can be said or what conclusions could be made about this 2.5 million as it relates to cannabis? Well percentages cannabis and where is it in in \nSPEAKER_02:  in the context of what we had in Tissue. \nSPEAKER_02:  Enough, it is so close to the living. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're having you to be. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, that's a great question. So I don't have the percentage of what cannabis is of that group that's something we can get for you because \nSPEAKER_03:  Within that mix, there are some revenues that are going up and some of the news that are going down. So it's not just \nSPEAKER_03:  to calculate a percentage. \nSPEAKER_03:  But you're absolutely right, cannabis, as a relatively new revenue source. \nSPEAKER_03:  had not been bringing in. \nSPEAKER_03:  the expected budget in the first couple years, the revenue budget for the first couple years that we had cannabis. \nSPEAKER_03:  And for FY20, we actually had budgeted at 4 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the FY20 actuals were 10 million. So that was a very huge \nSPEAKER_03:  a significant jump up compared to the budget, almost, you know, more than the double, double its budget. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in the out years for our projections for FY21 and calibrating for FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  We are projecting around the around 9 million. So not as high as the FY20 Actuals because we are still trying to factor in. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know. \nSPEAKER_03:  potentially just a bump that might have happened specifically as it relates to the pandemic and the specific influence of the pandemic that might. \nSPEAKER_03:  be recalibrated. \nSPEAKER_03:  But it is one of the very positive revenue streams in terms of higher \nSPEAKER_03:  then expected revenues coming in to help our situation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Excellent, thank you. I think I'm good for now. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions and appreciate the chair for giving me the opportunity to do so. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great questions. Great questions from both my colleagues. I did have one just follow up question related to. \nSPEAKER_02:  \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \nSPEAKER_05:  the projected. \nSPEAKER_05:  shortfall for \nSPEAKER_05:  20 \nSPEAKER_05:  3 FY 23, we know we have a structural issue and that's been made very clear. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  It's gonna be... \nSPEAKER_05:  really up to this committee and the entire City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  to make some tough decisions to get us within. \nSPEAKER_05:  structural balance, but you know. \nSPEAKER_05:  We have been \nSPEAKER_05:  dealing with some really extraordinary circumstances over the last couple of years, particularly the last year. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're just thrown. \nSPEAKER_05:  everything and to work. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I wanted to know specifically what percentage is the \nSPEAKER_05:  a structural shortfall. \nSPEAKER_05:  through the entire \nSPEAKER_05:  budget. This is \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I guess it around like. \nSPEAKER_05:  7% is that correct, Mr? \nSPEAKER_05:  Grocergic Grace. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, I'm so, let's see. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll go ahead, John. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I was going to say it's a $550 million budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so more or less. \nSPEAKER_04:  And 10% of that will be 55 million and we're talking about 37 million. So somewhere between 5 and 10%, it's like, let's say 7% grace can do that calculation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Jack. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, Cher Austin, your math is very, very on point. It's 6.7%. So your 7 or 8% was... \nSPEAKER_03:  was right on point around there assuming about 550. \nSPEAKER_03:  million being the general average operating cost. \nSPEAKER_05:  But we've got a little bit of time to make that number as low as possible. We'll get it close to zero as possible. So thank you so much for the report. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_00:  No public comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, put a comment. Is there any additional comment from \nSPEAKER_05:  Committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  Gary Nun. \nSPEAKER_05:  Let's go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_05:  to receive a file in the report. \nSPEAKER_00:  ever notion \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, here we go. \nSPEAKER_05:  The second. \nSPEAKER_05:  We move the second and thank you so much, y'all. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm clear. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  Remove this second. Now let's go to the vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilwoman Price. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice Chair Yuranga. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Dr Austin. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion carries."

More to exit. \nSPEAKER_04:  to accept the report. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're more in a second. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, we move the second in. Let's have a step presentation on this. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon. I'm going to present this report if I could go to the next page, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to talk about, give it a little background. \nSPEAKER_01:  For 60 years, the city has been receiving revenue from water and sewer funds. And I may sometimes call it just water, but it's really water and sewer, sanitary sewer, and from the gas fund now called energy resources. \nSPEAKER_01:  that had been going on a long time in 2016. \nSPEAKER_01:  We had a couple of lawsuits. The one that stuck around was the little jeans lawsuit, challenging the water and sewer transfers and the gas transfer. The gas transfer litigation went away. \nSPEAKER_01:  but the in the Logines lawsuit on water and sewer we reached a settlement. \nSPEAKER_01:  in 2017 where the city agreed to only transfer costs were supported by Nexus. That means where the General Fund provided services to Water and Sewer and Water and Sewer was simply paying for explicit services. That resulted in about a $8 million loss and in revenue to the General Fund. \nSPEAKER_01:  So in 2018, \nSPEAKER_01:  the city council put before the voters measured them, which explicitly restored the historical transfer and authorized it, but put a limit on it of 12% of \nSPEAKER_01:  water and gas revenues, again, although only water and sewer in question. \nSPEAKER_01:  That then resulted almost immediately in a second legions lawsuit, challenging the regality in the process by which a measure M was put before the voters that violated Proposition 218. \nSPEAKER_01:  and in 2019 and December. \nSPEAKER_01:  the Superior Court ruled against Sacramento in a similar \nSPEAKER_01:  My case. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if we can go to the next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Then in January, the Superior Court ruled in favor of legions after seeing that initial decision for Sacramento, but did not rule whether transfers and expenditures, I'm sorry, the transfers and the expenditure of the transfers would continue. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  Later that year, the peer record issued a ruling that transfers could be temporarily continued and expended, but required us to have escrows of the amount collected in increasing amounts by year. In other words, allowing us to phase in the escrow and the fact that we wouldn't be getting that revenue anymore. \nSPEAKER_01:  So in FY18, that's the year that just ended. We escrowed $3 million this year, which is FY21. We have to escrow $6 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  and from FY22 on. \nSPEAKER_01:  All transfers, again, water and sewer only. Not supported by the Nexus study, a half to be escrowed. We're estimating that at about $9 million a year beginning in 22. Again, 6 million and 21, up to 9 million and 20. \nSPEAKER_01:  to next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  So in November 2020, just a little while ago, the appellate court reversed the Sacramento Superior Court decision, agreeing with Sacramento's position that that transfer was in Sacramento's case appropriate and making it much more likely that Long Beach would prevail in the ongoing Maggiens litigation. \nSPEAKER_01:  and our appeal. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are expecting a decision from the appellate court on the legions case in December of 21. Obviously, that's after the FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  is adopt. \nSPEAKER_01:  We do expect the appellate court decision to be appealed regardless of who wins to the California Supreme Court. \nSPEAKER_01:  a few, but it's important to know that this is not fixable, but if the decision goes against the city, it's important to know that it's not \nSPEAKER_01:  going to be easy and maybe even not even possible to resolve it with another ballot question. The revenue will likely be lost if there is an adverse decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then one final other background, the Water Commission and FY21. \nSPEAKER_01:  authorized to transfer $2 million less than the city budgeted. \nSPEAKER_01:  But that's expected to be only a one-year reduction. So that's the background. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are appealing, as I mentioned, to the Appellate Court, the initial adverse decision by the Superior Court. \nSPEAKER_01:  And according to the city attorney and the opinion of the city attorney and RS2, we have a better than 50% chance of prevailing, particularly really because the appellate court reversed Sacramento decision and cited was Sacramento. \nSPEAKER_01:  The appellate court decision on what genes is going to come at the end of 21. We think we'll have to make decisions on the FY 22 budget for that decision is made. \nSPEAKER_01:  Regardless of that decision as I said earlier, we expect to appeal. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that decision, if the Supreme Court takes the case, is likely to be 12 to 18 months after the Appellate Court decision. Probably in the area of mid-23. \nSPEAKER_01:  probably in time for decisions on the F-Glite 24 budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  So our status is $9 million a year in revenue from the water sewer fund is at risk. That's money that provides for day-to-day operations of the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  We had to escrow 3 million and 20. We had to escrow 6 million and 21. \nSPEAKER_01:  If you add those together, we have $9 million escrowed in the bank as we speak. \nSPEAKER_01:  A different 9 million, 9 million is required to be escrowed in FY22 for the Superior Court ruling. Remember, it's incremental. So 3 million in 20, 6 million in 21, 9 million escrowed in 22. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the 22 budget will assume that the judge will vacate that escrow ruling because it is assumed the appellate court will reverse the, I should say it should have said, superior court judge will vacate that ruling. And the net transfer will be available to support operations. So regardless of the fact that at the moment we require desk or FY22, when we say we have a balanced budget with the federal money coming in. It assumes that we will not need to escrow the 9.0 end of us. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So the FY22 and out here projections assume that the city will prevail, as I just said. \nSPEAKER_01:  even though no final decision is expected until the Supreme Court rules. \nSPEAKER_01:  some time in FY 23. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to go through four scenarios here. I'm sorry for the complication of it, but they're in fact four possible outcomes. And I think it's important for you to hear. \nSPEAKER_01:  all the four possible outcomes. The first one is what we expect will happen, at least with a greater than 50% probability. I can't tell you 75, 60 or 80 because we don't know. \nSPEAKER_01:  But if the city prevails that the pellet cord and the Supreme Court, the city will have $9 million escrow funds to be expended on one times and it doesn't change the projections that you're hearing from Grace, which is for example $37 million shortfall on FY22. \nSPEAKER_01:  But the next option is the city loses in the Appellate Court, which will be December of this year, we think, but ultimately, prevents. \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, that means the city will have a 9 million shortfall on FY22 at mid year because when this appellate court makes the decision, we won't know what's the Supreme Court is going to say. So we have to assume. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have to follow the judges' Esquare requirements and we instantly have a $9 million shortfall in FY22. \nSPEAKER_01:  Therefore, the projected FY23 budget will be short. \nSPEAKER_01:  by $9 million will be worse if we don't structurally solve the problem in FY22. \nSPEAKER_01:  which we might. \nSPEAKER_01:  One way or another, we have a $9 million structural problem. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then for FY 24. \nSPEAKER_01:  The city will potentially have 27 million in one time funds that it can expand on whatever it wants after the positive Supreme Court decision. So we may have a short-term problem, but ultimately we'll have 27 million in one time money if we prevail at the Supreme Court, because all that money that we set aside can now be released. \nSPEAKER_01:  It will reverse the FY23 shortfall increase and have a positive impact on FY24 if we update all our projections. So that's what happens complicated if we lose at the appellate court and prevail at the Supreme Court. Again, though, we're thinking number one is the most likely, but there are three other options. So the next slide will give you the third option. \nSPEAKER_01:  If we lose, we get notified in December we lose and the Supreme Court either doesn't take the case or we lose if the Supreme Court \nSPEAKER_01:  That's the worst of all possible situations. We will have a 9-0 in shortfall next year and mid-year. \nSPEAKER_01:  The FY23 shortfall will be worse by $9 million and will jump to $46 million. Again, if we don't structurally resolve the problem. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then we will have to repay 25 million after the final decision of unescored money that we spent. \nSPEAKER_00:  on S- \nSPEAKER_01:  from the start to measure ammage goes all the way back to FY18. \nSPEAKER_01:  That 25 million we don't have. \nSPEAKER_01:  At least, unless we... \nSPEAKER_01:  get rid of all of our emergency reserve, which probably would not be a good idea. So we might consider issuing judgment bonds, and that will cost somewhere between 2 million and 3 and a half million dollars a year to pay off the debt service. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's option three or possible circumstance number three. Next page. \nSPEAKER_01:  But this next one gets really nasty. It doesn't more money, but it creates a difficult situation where we prevail at the pellet court this year, late this calendar year, but we ultimately lose at the Supreme Court. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  That in summary is we'll have 9 million and escrow funds that get released. \nSPEAKER_01:  But we're going to recommend at least financial management is going to recommend that you hold onto them and not spend them \nSPEAKER_01:  because of the risks of an adverse Supreme Court decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  The budget projections for FY24 again become worse, but now we potentially have to repay 42 million instead of 25 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that's because we are presumably going to be spending on operations 9 million in funds that we no longer need to escrow for each year. And it adds another 18 million dollars to the cost. Those judgment bonds, if we ultimately lose, could add about 3.5 million to 6 million dollars a year to our structural problem. \nSPEAKER_01:  So those are the four options. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I'm going to try to summarize it. \nSPEAKER_01:  that measure M anyway you look at it is a major financial issue. Hopefully it ends quietly and goes away at the end of this year. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are assuming that in all the projections you are hearing, we're relying on the Appellate Court Sacramento decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  that was similar to our situation and our city attorney's assessment again which we agree with which is better than a 50-50 chance of prevailing. \nSPEAKER_01:  The liability for the city, if the city ultimately loses, is somewhere between 25 and 42 million dollars in money that we spent for measure M and didn't escrow. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then that, and when you add that to judgment bond costs, you're talking about increased \nSPEAKER_01:  costs or net shortfall of $11 to $15 million a year for some time between 10 and 20 years. It's a big deal. \nSPEAKER_01:  Assuming the city will prevail and not setting aside the Esco revenue and the 22 and 23 budgets is reasonable. \nSPEAKER_01:  but it's not conservative. That doesn't mean... \nSPEAKER_01:  that we think it's the right thing to do because the numbers are so big, but there are consequences if we lose, the city will have a lot of money to pay back and not an easy way to do it. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are recommending. \nSPEAKER_01:  that you don't escrow the money and that we included as if we're going to win, but we need to have contingency plans and reduction options for mid-year FY22. And that's one reason why the city manager has asked the departments to submit reduction targets about equal to $9 billion. \nSPEAKER_01:  And with that, that's the end of my presentation and open for questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, thank you again, Mr. Gross, for a wonderful presentation. I don't know how wonderful it is, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  Certainly. \nSPEAKER_05:  You are. \nSPEAKER_05:  Give us the information we need to have. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I did have a question, but I think it was answered. I was very curious to know whether or not the \nSPEAKER_05:  Project is shortfalls. \nSPEAKER_05:  on FY 22 and 23. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  included the \nSPEAKER_05:  They transfer from measure M, which is under litigation and I understand that not to be the case, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Now, we assume that we will win. And so it includes the money and we are spending that money in the FY22 and 23 budget. That's what creates the financial risk, or increases the financial risk. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's the... \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm clear. I'm clear on that. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_05:  And do we have any idea, I know this is outside of the financial realm, but do we have any idea when the \nSPEAKER_05:  Sacramento appellate decision. \nSPEAKER_05:  will that \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll know when they expect that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is not organization in prison. \nSPEAKER_01:  We did it! \nSPEAKER_01:  Is when are we going to expect our decision from the Appellate Court? It's in December of 21. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Sacramento Pellet decision supporting Sacramento was in January or December of 20. I can't remember what mislides it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's already been made. \nSPEAKER_03:  2019. \nSPEAKER_01:  2019. \nSPEAKER_01:  yeah \nSPEAKER_01:  No. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Pollock decision I think was in November of 2020. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, \nSPEAKER_05:  I guess my question is did that litigation continue or is there any? \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't believe the answer to that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't think that's the answer to that. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  very good question and I don't know the answer. We'll have to get that back to the committee unless we have an attorney on \nSPEAKER_01:  on the line who can answer that question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi, it's Taylor from City Attorney's Office. So the information I have on. \nSPEAKER_00:  The appellate case is that... \nSPEAKER_00:  submission deadlines are in June and that we're anticipating oral arguments. \nSPEAKER_00:  and a decision probably around the end of 2021. So the timeline that John gave is accurate. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, I'd like to turn it over to my colleagues by share. \nSPEAKER_05:  But, yeah, whoops. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it's pretty clear as John is smiling face I could see it right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  with the doom and doom, with real hell with budget deficits. \nSPEAKER_04:  but hopefully we will prevail. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we... \nSPEAKER_04:  every all the options that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Mr. Gross presented will be moved. \nSPEAKER_04:  and we'll have option one to live with. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I mean, I have. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's understandable that the measure M has been \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll be your positive thing for the city, however, because of the litigation. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're going to have to go through this process of \nSPEAKER_04:  of a real portion of it and making it real for us so that we can continue our work. \nSPEAKER_04:  operations in the water and sewer. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Council Member Price. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't have any questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I like to just add a comment that, you know, obviously. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  there. \nSPEAKER_05:  Everyone has a... \nSPEAKER_05:  the right to disagree. \nSPEAKER_05:  with operations of the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  I am and uh but \nSPEAKER_05:  And oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  litigation does have impacts and it just shows that. \nSPEAKER_05:  This type of litigation would have a dramatic impact on our ability to continue to provide the level of service that we do for our residents and \nSPEAKER_05:  I really wish we could get this behind us because \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I really wish we could get this behind us. I think this is unfortunate. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I like to, there's a motion in the second. I know \nSPEAKER_05:  We have not had public comment. Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_03:  No public comment here. \nSPEAKER_05:  During none, there's a motion on the floor to receive and file this report. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd like to go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  there are standard \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  I show you, Anga. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilwoman Price. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ocean Carries. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. I believe that concludes our agenda. I'd like to go to \nSPEAKER_05:  public comments in general if there's any."
