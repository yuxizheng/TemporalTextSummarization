        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  We're still starting to take 10 minutes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. So now I'd like to welcome Director of Economic Development John Keisler. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good afternoon, Council members, and thank you to everybody who's joining us from home. My name is John Keisler. I'm the Economic Development Director for the City of Long Beach, and I'm just gonna give you a quick overview of the structure of the economic relief package, how it was established, ultimately, what it's up to and where people can provide input as we start the implementation process. So going back to March 4th, Governor Newsom declared the state of emergency due to COVID-19, which then triggered on March 17th our city council to take action on an economic relief package for working families and small businesses. On March 19th, the state issued stay-at-home executive orders. The city on April 10th followed whether our own updates to our health order, which is called safer at home. And ultimately, that led to the city council receiving from city staff and then adopting 25 individual economic relief initiatives to address not only the impacts of some of the public health crisis, but also the economic crisis that was emerging for Long Beach-based businesses who were responding to the health orders from both the state and the city health officer. The 25 individual economic relief initiatives, this is one of historic actions by the city council. Covered a range of issues, everything from sick leave benefits so that workers could go home if they were sick and not transmit the virus, worker protections to help protect workers and customers while on the job site. \nSPEAKER_00:  Emergency loan programs for small businesses, unemployment insurance, program support, eviction protections for both commercial and residential tenants and resources for residents in quarantine. There were many more. These are just a couple of the groups of the different initiatives that council approved. After approving those initiatives, what typically happens for us as city management is that we will take those initiatives and build business plans. So we will do a number of different things with regard to public input, legal review, financial review. But the economic development and finance committee is one of the first places we go because this is a standing committee of three members of the city council that are appointed to have regular meetings on issues of concern for the council to consider. They're responsible for reviewing matters of economic development, could be the city's finances. But oftentimes we will come to the economic development and finance committee with reports like this about status of city council directed initiatives. \nSPEAKER_00:  Another area that there is transparency and public input is our economic development commission. This is a commission that is appointed by the mayor. There are 11 members. They meet every month on the last Tuesday. They are the ones that were responsible for preparing the initial recommendations that led to the blueprint for economic development three years ago. They have had two months where we were asked to council meetings due to COVID-19, but we'll be resuming in May. In meantime, all of these economic impact or relief initiatives have a commission champion. We still reach out to them for their expertise and the various sectors of our economy to provide us with advice and ultimately connect us with resources. The public can also attend those meetings. You can go to the city's website to get agendas. You can sign up for alerts and join us at the last Tuesday of each month. Another advisory group that was formed for the economic relief efforts to review policies and procedures to recommend how we might take a smart approach to reopening the local economy. You'll hear from our former mayor Bob Foster in just a few minutes was established on April 21st. Those members represent a broad range of industries who are looking at all of the different aspects of both the city of Long Beach as well as best practices from around the world to prepare a report which will ultimately go back to our city manager and be reviewed by our health officer for city council approval or review. That could inform many different ideas about regulation, about where the city can take action to make it easier for businesses to reopen and make it safer for consumers and visitors to Long Beach. Another area for public input that has been formed this one was directed by the city council as part of the economic relief package is the hospitality recovery task force. That was established on April 22nd and our deputy director Sergio Ramirez who has lots of experience in the hospitality sector will talk a bit about the background to that committee when he introduces some of our members from the hospitality recovery task force a little bit later in this meeting but the goal of this committee will be to engage public subject matter experts who are owners and operators of businesses to get a sense of what it is that the city can do to restart the hospitality industry in a safe way. And then we're also doing things to provide input from from residents. So many members of our community residents business owners could be workers. They have ideas as well and on April 28th we launched the reopen Long Beach or reopen LB. That's an online survey. I have the website here on the slide so that you can see it. And as a teaser we've had over 11,000 responses already in just the first 48 hours. People really are responding to this survey to provide input and the graphic that's on this page is actually from the survey. I'm not going to tell you what it is because it's changing every minute but it is collecting data in real time and providing us as city staff with lots of input and some of my staff I Sergio sitting next to me now will be going through at least 4,000 responses so far that are written. We'll be going through that information and promise that the community will be heard through reopen LB. So then one last section that I wanted to cover before I hand this off is what's going on with regard to the state of California because ultimately for economic development to happen states and local governments actually regulate both public health and commerce within the state. And so right now there's six critical indicators that the governor governor Gavin Newsom has indicated will guide the state in its reopening process. As you can see from the slide testing and contact tracing the ability to isolate those who are positive, preventing infection for people who are at greater risk, strengthening our hospital and health systems, developing and delivering therapeutics and then physical distancing at places of business, education, child care facilities before we start to reopen. And then of course putting in the process or the infrastructure so if we need to reinstate certain measures like we saw what happened in Hong Kong and Singapore, having the ability to ramp up quickly to keep our public safe. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then one other update that came out this last week to provide more, a little bit more clarity and transparency about what the governor is anticipating is the road map for reopening that was shared this week by the state of California. These are four stages with a big transition phase between stage one and stage two. But the graphic that's on the screen right now really covers this stage that we're in right now, which is the safety and preparedness stage. It talks a bit about how we'll transition between where we are to where we get in the coming weeks, what government actions, business actions and individual actions have to take place. And stage two and three cover how we'll ramp up slowly over the next couple of weeks to make sure that we keep people safe, don't go backwards, and ultimately have the certainty for the private sector to make the investments in inventory and in rehiring and staffing up. \nSPEAKER_00:  So there are many more opportunities for import and transparency. I mentioned the Economic Development and Finance Committee meetings, Economic Development Commission meetings. City Council, of course, we have regular weekly meetings on Tuesday nights, where we provide reports as well as action items. We have a number of different advisory and task force groups that are really subject matter experts in the various areas that we are asked to provide strategies by the City Council. \nSPEAKER_00:  You can get memos from the city manager. We produce those on a weekly basis. It could recover a range of issues from where we are with our unemployment numbers and new support programs. We also have, of course, the online surveys is a way to get information. And then, of course, we'll be providing some feedback about what information we received. And then we do a lot of one-on-one outreach from staff. So that could be a staff member calling on a particular issue. That could be also attending community meetings that are held by the city council. So with that, I am actually going to turn it back to the chair, Chair Richardson. I'm happy to answer any questions or move on in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Mr. Kyzler. \nSPEAKER_02:  The City Council is pretty familiar with this process, but thank you for presenting this presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  I want to remind the public that this document is available on the City Clerk's page and legislature. \nSPEAKER_02:  So you can download this report. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would say \nSPEAKER_02:  The main takeaway here is that. \nSPEAKER_02:  The decision making process is very complex, but there are multiple points to provide input. \nSPEAKER_02:  All of that input will be public and transparent. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we'll factor into the decisions that are made. \nSPEAKER_02:  by our city's health officer. \nSPEAKER_02:  The city is better made by the City Council. \nSPEAKER_02:  and decisions that are made within our emergency operating center. And so, John, where can we find any of the COVID-related economic resources? \nSPEAKER_02:  Just give us the website. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, that's great. I really appreciate the opportunity to do this commercial. So we have a couple of places. If you're a phone caller, you can call 516-5704, the number four biz, four B-I-Z. So 570-4 biz, we have live call takers who can point you in the right direction or answer your questions about business and worker resources. We also have a website that is 2477, seven days a week, and that's at lawnbeach.gov. Slash for biz. So that's lawnbeach.gov slash the number four B-I-Z. And that has a lot of the similar resources and opportunities I described. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, John. I want to go to the committee quickly, Vice Chair Mungo. Do you have any questions for John specifically related to the... \nSPEAKER_02:  the framework of the public input. \nSPEAKER_01:  I love the public input. The only thing I would say is I think your data is from two days ago. I think we have over 10,000 people who've now taken the survey. So we're really excited about that. If you notice someone who hasn't taken the survey, make sure to forward it to them. So they can provide the right point. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Vice Chair. Council member, you're on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Amen. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I would, I would, there you go. Yeah, I was a beauty, then a beauty. So I have no comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the new humble responds. \nSPEAKER_03:  Other than the graphic. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we appreciate it. That's it, Bargraf. \nSPEAKER_03:  We love a lot of colors on it as you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, by now I'm for blind. \nSPEAKER_03:  I wasn't really able to interpret that graph, because you interpreted it formally. \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember Urenga, that was a sneak peek. So you caught me. I am not going to be able to disclose what those bars are, but that is a real graph. It's changing every minute. That had to do actually with the different things that people felt were lower risk and safer for reopening. We will have the survey closed. I think your real question is, the survey will close Monday, May 4th at 5 PM. So the community has until Monday, May 4th at 5 PM to respond. There are many questions in the survey that cover the issues that have been discussed by the governor as well as different governors across the country about activities like outdoor recreation, low-risk retail. And we've asked the community to really tell us, well, how do you feel about re-entering public spaces as well as certain business activities? So please, everybody use that link, reopen LB, and please provide your input. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you John. So this is a receiving file, so we don't \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't believe we need to take a boat here. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'd like to close out this item. \nSPEAKER_02:  and move directly to item number three."

I mentioned it a little bit earlier. I'm not sure if it was streaming or not yet, but. \nSPEAKER_04:  for this to be your first official. \nSPEAKER_04:  City Council hearing since leaving office we wish we could have added in our bot flot Pacific chambers and \nSPEAKER_04:  I know you've been to those chambers, but I want to say thank you for coming out of retirement to help \nSPEAKER_04:  the city pulled through this initiative, this emergency and we're glad to have you. \nSPEAKER_04:  out. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're glad to have you here at the committee. If you want to go ahead and get started and share with us some of your activities. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure, Mr. Chair, can you hear that? So I'm not sure I'm being heard. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can hear it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, Mr. Chairman, members, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the committee about the very early work of the task force, which is the name restart long beach. I want to make we've only been in existence for about nine days, but I want to make it clear that this is strictly an advisory task force. It's going to be advisory primarily to the \nSPEAKER_01:  the Mayor of the City Council and the City Manager. \nSPEAKER_01:  No decisions or actions are going to be taken by the advisory committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  We will hopefully provide. \nSPEAKER_01:  the city with recommendations on. \nSPEAKER_01:  approximately when you can reopen, what sectors might be \nSPEAKER_01:  reopen first, try to sequence things, talk about the conditions and protocol for reopening. \nSPEAKER_01:  And as a couple of things are governing our work, and first of all, we have one meeting we're having, another meeting tomorrow. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will say that our work is the work that we have is \nSPEAKER_01:  kept within the group right now for a couple of reasons. One, we don't want them to sleep anybody. We want a free flow of discussion. And if something comes out of the group and it sounds crazy, then you're on defense. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  We intend to have a free flowing discussion. Hopefully my goal is to have an early set of very early recommendations, hopefully to the Mayor and the City Council by the end of this week at the earliest early part of next weekend. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I think we can do that. Now a couple of things are guiding our deliberations. First of all, it's been a, as I mentioned to you earlier, it's been a lot more work tonight. Thought it would be, but we have gone through, I mean, there's a Harvard report, a Johns Hopkins report, a federal report, the United States Association of Governors report, this reports from Morgan Stanley and \nSPEAKER_01:  and from Goldman Sachs and Gospels, we're doing a lot of very good information. \nSPEAKER_01:  out there even early on about how you might approach reopening. A couple things are clear. \nSPEAKER_01:  at least now. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that first of all, we all know why it's important. I mean, you know it is represented as a city. People are getting a little antsy. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's been a long time and it's been to keep the healthcare system intact and make sure it's functioning. People are doing a very good job of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  But to get the rest of us says you probably know more importantly. \nSPEAKER_01:  in order for you as a city and for the state and the country. \nSPEAKER_01:  have the resources necessary to combat this and to be able to provide the assistance, you have to restart some economic activity. Then as the Health Officer mentioned, in progressment has its own health effects. And so I know everybody's mindful of that. So we know that there's some urgency to try to get something to you as quickly as possible. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will say that, you know, we know that the reopening probably has to begin with. \nSPEAKER_01:  low risk and low density activities, this virus. \nSPEAKER_01:  appears to love density over prolonged periods. So we look at that very carefully. So what can you open? What sectors can you open? You look at those that are low density and low duration, low risk, in effect. \nSPEAKER_01:  and see if we can start there. Even with those, you have to provide the requirements in which you can operate. And you all know those, those are sanitation and face coverings and dealing with the proper procedures so that you can protect the public. \nSPEAKER_01:  And more importantly, to do what we said, we started in this process, which is to preserve the capacity of health care assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  The key issues are when you restart. \nSPEAKER_01:  what sectors do you start with under what conditions and protocols. And so as I said, we're, I think we've got a great group of people from all sectors of the economy and all parts of the city both geographically. It's a very diverse group. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I will tell you the first meeting we had last Friday. \nSPEAKER_01:  went very well. People were really dedicated to this. There's been a lot of reading required. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, you know, just, you know, just even going through all the various orders of the state and the county and the city. Uh, in addition to all the reports that are backing, uh, that are backing all those up and are going to talk to you about the reopening. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's been a lot of work and I really want to applaud the group the group's done a great job \nSPEAKER_01:  very on task. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I suspect that we will have something new to the council very shortly. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  We got to be specific about some of those sectors. Look, and I want to caution everyone. \nSPEAKER_01:  No one's going to get this perfectly right. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, I'm not the kind of the group's not, you're not. \nSPEAKER_01:  The key thing we have to do is monitor this very carefully. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's going to be some risks that everyone's going to take, but when we take those risks, we've got to make sure that we monitor that if there is a hiccup, we can respond to it as a city. So that's also guiding some of the issues that we have. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I want to, I, the staff of the city, John has been \nSPEAKER_01:  terrific the staff resources have been very helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  I love it that council member you're wrong. I'm going to caught, I swear you got to watch him every minute on that graph when he didn't know what the bars were. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was very honest comment, but I thought that was terrific. Roberto, good job. And I will tell you from what I've seen from the members of the task force. \nSPEAKER_01:  from the city staff, from elected officials, from \nSPEAKER_01:  general public, people are united on this and the people want. \nSPEAKER_01:  want to do the right thing. We want to make sure that the healthcare system is protected. We minimize. \nSPEAKER_01:  the impact on that, but everyone's really focused on trying it. \nSPEAKER_01:  and get this economy open and get it in an open and proper way. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't have any specifics on any recommendation, Jez, as I said, you should have those shortly. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  And with that, I'll just respond to any questions. Sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Mayor. And I think your approach makes sense. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it's important to be cautious. \nSPEAKER_04:  about releasing information too early as things are being vetted. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think all the consideration given to \nSPEAKER_04:  sort of helps in monitoring I think are the things that I'm here in community. \nSPEAKER_04:  and in a month I have killed \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm glad that you I'm hearing this from you as a chair of that committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  Our role, again, as the City Council, is to really provide oversight to all of these provided fees advisory efforts and make sure that it's organized. \nSPEAKER_04:  and communicate it. \nSPEAKER_04:  clearly through an open and transparent process. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  for coming in here. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're going to again I'm going to go to some of the council members for some questions, but just a reminder folks this won't be the only opportunity to hear about the progress of the committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  The advisory committee will have some recommendations next week is what the mayor mentioned. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we also have a second committee meeting two weeks to write updates on where all of these activities are going. So this is the official. \nSPEAKER_04:  sort of public. \nSPEAKER_04:  Transparency Cross is here. \nSPEAKER_04:  I want to go to the committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  I see if we have any clarifying questions about Marifaster's process. I'm learning to start with \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilmember Euranga this time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So again, thank you, Mayor, for your participation in this today. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I grabbed what I saw and it meant nothing to me. \nSPEAKER_03:  The \nSPEAKER_01:  You did better than I did, Councilmember. I looked at it and I thought I understood it, but it didn't say anything. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  You gotta get big lapses like these guys. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, one of the things that stands out, obviously, in my evaluation, I want to take a place here is that I think we all know that small business is the backbone of our economy. \nSPEAKER_03:  And uh, have you been... \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm pretty, I'm gonna be guessing here that we are getting a lot of input. \nSPEAKER_03:  from our small businesses. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  what they say for TV. \nSPEAKER_03:  approach towards getting back online with our economy. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm hoping that any recommendation that comes from your advisory group would address. \nSPEAKER_03:  small businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I would I can tell you council member that's a priority. First of all, I'll tell you my own view having, you know, I come from a business background, both owning my own business and working in a big business and one of the things that I've stressed. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the group and there are a lot of small business people on this group. \nSPEAKER_01:  One of the things I've stressed today is they know they're already preparing about how to open. \nSPEAKER_01:  because it's in their interest to open quickly, it's in their interest to open safely. They want to make sure they provide protection for the workers and for the customers. So they've already done a great deal of work and analysis on how to do that. That's one of the best sources of information. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the advisory group. It's already paid off. You're going to hear from \nSPEAKER_01:  one of the restaurant tours today. \nSPEAKER_01:  who's been very helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  Ackybocc. \nSPEAKER_01:  and having us understand what the difficulties are with restaurants opening and how to work conditions they can open. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, all of us, if you haven't been in business, you can miss that. We might sit here or you might sit there, I'm no longer there. If you sit there as a policy maker, you may say, well, you know, we can open this with these requirements. And they may sound good, but they may be totally unworkable economically. \nSPEAKER_01:  You may put those out there and nobody would open it because they can't. It's not economic or commercially viable. \nSPEAKER_01:  to open a business under those conditions. \nSPEAKER_01:  It doesn't mean you can open everything and it doesn't mean you have to just make it possible for everything to open, but you need to be governed. \nSPEAKER_01:  by both the public safety and health effects, and then realism about what it takes to be commercially viable. Then very helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so, yes, the answer to your question is we will get a tremendous amount of input ultimately. \nSPEAKER_01:  All those decisions are going to rest with the state of California, the county of Los Angeles and the city along each and Some of those some of those decisions are going to be difficult \nSPEAKER_01:  My job is to give you all the data we can and best information with the best recommendations. And I know we'll do that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Though \nSPEAKER_03:  That's what I'm glad you're doing it that type of approach because there's \nSPEAKER_03:  And is anything that I know about this city council that we have here? \nSPEAKER_03:  Many of us are data driven and we'd like to see what the data shows us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then make our decisions from there, of course, taking all the other. \nSPEAKER_03:  considerations into the player as well. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. We want to go to Vice Chair Mungo. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks, Councilor Richardson. Thank you, Bob. Mayor Foster, we really appreciate you taking the time to volunteer for this opportunity. I would just also ask that when the recommendations come back, if there are some longer term things that we just don't see as viable, I think putting together some timelines for people that are realistic. \nSPEAKER_02:  I've talked to some people in different industries who recognize that their area might not come back very quickly, but they would love to know. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  What kind of timeline? And I know we can't really predict. \nSPEAKER_02:  how long for her community and how long to have vaccinations available, but at least give them something on the horizon of a check-in point where we will check back on this in three months or every so often so that they can better understand whether it's conventions, whether it's big medical meetings where they teach different things. They're doing that all online, but there's some definite \nSPEAKER_02:  and stepbacks that happen when they can't get together in person. And so just for them to better understand, okay, we know not for six months, but that we'll come back together and what that timeline looks like for them. \nSPEAKER_01:  And thank you, Council Member, I think that's a great suggestion and we will do that look back. \nSPEAKER_01:  Part of the benefit of trying to get discussions and hopefully some early \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendations to the council on this is to give. \nSPEAKER_01:  give the public a sense that at least you're getting to a beginning of the end. \nSPEAKER_01:  No one knows where this is going to end. No one knows what? \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, what's going to be available? There's a treatment drug now, a rendezer fear, which looks promising. But \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, it's not fully tested. \nSPEAKER_01:  a vaccine that I heard announcement today from the federal government that \nSPEAKER_01:  They're going to try to have the vaccines widely available by the beginning of the year, but \nSPEAKER_01:  Who knows, that finished. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  you at least need to let the public know and then and we'll do what we can to help you. \nSPEAKER_01:  that were cognizant of the anxiety, particularly for the opposite of what I mentioned. \nSPEAKER_01:  for things that are high density with long durations. Those are the most difficult problems. \nSPEAKER_01:  but we're \nSPEAKER_01:  That doesn't mean you don't work on them. That doesn't mean you don't try to solve them. That doesn't mean there aren't creative ways among the businesses that are involved in that. Being able to work under rules that will reduce risk. So I couldn't agree more. We need to give people hope basically. \nSPEAKER_01:  that things will return to some form and normal. \nSPEAKER_01:  at a reasonable time. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you Mayor Foster for joining us. \nSPEAKER_04:  We wish you got to be with this process for the sake of our entire city. We will continue to pay attention. \nSPEAKER_04:  We look forward to those recommendations. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll let you get back to your day and we're going to move on with the agenda. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you and the committee members for your. \nSPEAKER_01:  dedication to this and you can hear \nSPEAKER_01:  You can really hear the empathy coming from all of you and I appreciate that.

And before we get started, two notes. One. \nSPEAKER_06:  out. \nSPEAKER_06:  We had a talk with some of the council members. \nSPEAKER_06:  The next three items we really want to list. \nSPEAKER_06:  because we have a lot of great testimony. \nSPEAKER_06:  from folks who are impacted by three distinct sectors. And we're starting. \nSPEAKER_06:  with. \nSPEAKER_06:  tourism and so we're going to spend reserve a lot of time for \nSPEAKER_06:  for \nSPEAKER_06:  Test the money, we're going to reserve some of our comments to the very end. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I want to introduce Sergio, our deputy director of economic development to introduce this \nSPEAKER_06:  phase of the meeting. So, Sergio, please take this away. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you get afternoon council members This item is actually very similar to the item that former mayor Bob Foster Disintroduced this is regarding the hospitality advisory task force that has been put together as you all know Hospitality industry is one of the biggest business Sectors into our city and to our local economy last year It it translated to a 1.8 billion dollars to the local Long Beach economy and of course Due to COVID-19 it has been significantly hurt \nSPEAKER_02:  On April 14th, the City Council, as part of the historic economic relief package that was developed to respond to COVID-19, developed one of the components that came out of that historic package was a project that the City Council directed the City Manager to develop a plan to bring forward strategies and for recovery of our business travel, our leisure tourism convention for here citywide. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  after the COVID-19 safer at home health order is lifted. \nSPEAKER_02:  In response to that, a city council direction, economic development staff, immediately began to outreach to subject matter experts in our local hospitality industry, including hotel operators, restaurant owners, attraction operators, labor representatives, transportation operators, as well as other city departments. \nSPEAKER_02:  In addition, staff turn to our partners at the CVB to provide key insights and their expertise pertaining to the Long Beach destination. \nSPEAKER_02:  staff brought together an advisory group of over 30 business and labor stakeholders, as well as city representatives from the City Attorney's Office, special events, airport, the health department, along with the CVB and economic development to form the hospitality recovery task force. \nSPEAKER_02:  I now want to introduce one of the leading members of the hospitality task force, the president and CEO of the Long Beach Area CVB, Mr. Steve Goodling, who will share with you a little bit of what the task force has been working on. Steve. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great, thanks, Sergio. \nSPEAKER_05:  Also, Chair Richardson, Vice Chair Mungo and Council Member Yorangha. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for your time and also thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Sergio and John for your help in \nSPEAKER_05:  or honestly two very productive meetings. \nSPEAKER_05:  as has been shared by our membership. \nSPEAKER_05:  I, to go into the Sergio mentioned we were \nSPEAKER_05:  at $1.8 billion. \nSPEAKER_05:  in economic impact in 2002. \nSPEAKER_05:  and TOT we generated 12.4 million that last year 30.6 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  the challenge is right now with COVID. \nSPEAKER_05:  is that it has \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  basically flattened us to about a 10% occupant. \nSPEAKER_05:  That means as the fourth largest tax revenue generator for the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  That will not be the case this year. \nSPEAKER_05:  The hotels are projecting anywhere from a 25 to 35% occupancy. \nSPEAKER_05:  for the entire year. \nSPEAKER_05:  versus 82% to 85% last year. \nSPEAKER_05:  be \nSPEAKER_05:  The total amount of visitor impact is by beacon economics. \nSPEAKER_05:  Last year was close to 70. \nSPEAKER_05:  $1 billion. \nSPEAKER_05:  and it is the second largest. \nSPEAKER_05:  job sector in the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  with over 18,000 of us. \nSPEAKER_05:  the task in talking with members of the council and also with city management team. \nSPEAKER_05:  was how do we reboot as we come out of these favorite home restrictions? \nSPEAKER_05:  and they're lifted. \nSPEAKER_05:  and the first travel statement that we... \nSPEAKER_05:  that we all instinctively knew was a pleasure to travel. \nSPEAKER_05:  We realize there's hesitation. \nSPEAKER_05:  and getting back out there by some parties. \nSPEAKER_05:  But we also know, as Mayor Foster said, \nSPEAKER_05:  that there are people who are ready to get out. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so we came up with a marketing program which was requested. \nSPEAKER_05:  by the Council on by city management. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we've already prior to this. \nSPEAKER_05:  have placed over $300,000 in print advertising. \nSPEAKER_05:  because those have to be secured further out. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we're in Sunset Magazine, AAA, Westways Magazine. \nSPEAKER_05:  and also last Andrew's magazine. \nSPEAKER_05:  But in addition, there was suggestions of finding additional monies. \nSPEAKER_05:  to \nSPEAKER_05:  do advertising to jumpstart. \nSPEAKER_05:  the summer travel. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so we put together a plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  450,000 to do social marketing. \nSPEAKER_05:  and also 100,000 into radio. \nSPEAKER_05:  The overall impression of this plan would be 35. \nSPEAKER_05:  40 million people. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I'm going to go through this library quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  But basically we would be focused on social media channels. \nSPEAKER_05:  such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. \nSPEAKER_05:  The nice thing about being in social media is \nSPEAKER_05:  we can turn it on very quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if these sanctions are not lifted until June, \nSPEAKER_05:  we can start it. \nSPEAKER_05:  when they're live. \nSPEAKER_05:  whereas the print we had to get in just due to the... \nSPEAKER_05:  the challenges of publications having to go to press. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then get them out. \nSPEAKER_05:  Our target audiences, we're honestly our people who actually want to travel. \nSPEAKER_05:  We know there's families that are ready to get out. \nSPEAKER_05:  We also have Leisure Travelers, Beach Goers. \nSPEAKER_05:  Young professionals, LGBTQ. \nSPEAKER_05:  And basically, \nSPEAKER_05:  Many of these sectors have disposable incomes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  even though there's many people that have been impacted with this. \nSPEAKER_05:  We also know that there are people that are ready to go. \nSPEAKER_05:  and Piano for to go and that's our goal. \nSPEAKER_05:  is to bring them into our hotels and stomach. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the hotels can start to grow occupancy. \nSPEAKER_05:  and bring employees back. \nSPEAKER_05:  and quite honestly as they stay overnight at Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  They filled her out into our restaurants. \nSPEAKER_05:  and start to visit our waterfront. \nSPEAKER_05:  and surrounding area. \nSPEAKER_05:  The plan is basically what 810 templates. \nSPEAKER_05:  on social media. \nSPEAKER_05:  we'll be doing videos. \nSPEAKER_05:  talk about radio and also podcasts. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is a sample of one of our print ads. \nSPEAKER_05:  We know that people are concerned about traveling. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so our tagline basically is \nSPEAKER_05:  We have a lot of beach and lots of open space. \nSPEAKER_05:  We know that people... \nSPEAKER_05:  Basically, think density is equivalent to COVID. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we want people to know and looking at our shoreline and our waterfront areas. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we have lots of open space. \nSPEAKER_05:  Lots of space to play to run, to bike, to hike. \nSPEAKER_05:  Rock. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that we also have great attract. \nSPEAKER_05:  whether it's well watching. \nSPEAKER_05:  or whether it's going to our collaborative specific or green marriage. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we feel that this image is a general \nSPEAKER_05:  overall impression of an inviting wide open \nSPEAKER_05:  Peace. \nSPEAKER_05:  that people will feel safe and actually enjoy. \nSPEAKER_05:  These are some samples of... \nSPEAKER_05:  some social media that we're looking at. \nSPEAKER_05:  inviting people back to the various areas of the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  That would be to jumpstart the summer travel. \nSPEAKER_05:  Our major segment. \nSPEAKER_05:  in the city of Long Beach's first convention. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we've spent a lot of time looking at this. \nSPEAKER_05:  also monitoring the governor's reports. \nSPEAKER_05:  phases. \nSPEAKER_05:  as we know, conventions are faced for. \nSPEAKER_05:  as Vice Chair Mungo said, big question is. \nSPEAKER_05:  One just phase four begin. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're getting questions from our clients who are also following the governor's remarks. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we really soon need to be able to tell people. \nSPEAKER_05:  because if we can't host them. \nSPEAKER_05:  here in Long Beach and this really applies throughout the state. \nSPEAKER_05:  these clients will be looking at the state's neighboring us. \nSPEAKER_05:  because they still need to have their meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  And of course, we want to keep them here in Long Beach and not lose them. \nSPEAKER_05:  I going on to that. \nSPEAKER_05:  The economic impact of summer and we really \nSPEAKER_05:  do not feel that phase four will be starting in the summer. We hope that \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Realistic that it most likely will not happen. \nSPEAKER_05:  That means we'll have nine conventions canceling this summer. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're an economic impact of over 25 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  now we're \nSPEAKER_05:  going into the fall or the fourth quarter, which is \nSPEAKER_05:  basically September through December. \nSPEAKER_05:  If we can't begin in the fall. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that is questionable. \nSPEAKER_05:  it will have an impact of over $52 million in impacting 18 of our group. \nSPEAKER_05:  sooner we begin. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sooner we begin. \nSPEAKER_05:  So you know what, I'm sure this. \nSPEAKER_05:  and we do understand it has to be. \nSPEAKER_00:  we do understand. \nSPEAKER_05:  be held. \nSPEAKER_05:  ANYMAKE? \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  basically the phase four guidelines that were provided. \nSPEAKER_05:  hoping that phase four begins. \nSPEAKER_05:  before by January at the latest. \nSPEAKER_05:  That would be wonderful if not. \nSPEAKER_05:  if the conditions are meant to face for. \nSPEAKER_05:  We have 24 groups. \nSPEAKER_05:  that will need to cancel and that would be over $64 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're good. \nSPEAKER_05:  watch \nSPEAKER_05:  The other component of this is not just whether large gatherings can occur. \nSPEAKER_05:  but also the social distance. \nSPEAKER_05:  whether it's four feet or six feet. \nSPEAKER_05:  We know that 60 is a CDC guideline. \nSPEAKER_05:  But we also know that there's been conversations that people are wearing face masks. \nSPEAKER_05:  if the facilities. \nSPEAKER_05:  are doing throughout cleaning. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Also, there's a lot of hand sanitizations. \nSPEAKER_05:  and social distancing. \nSPEAKER_05:  in the public spaces that for fee might be permissible. \nSPEAKER_05:  Some people are even talking about. \nSPEAKER_05:  a percentage of capacity, so I'll put rules as it goes. \nSPEAKER_05:  You can accommodate 100 people. \nSPEAKER_05:  per se, 60% instead of 8%. \nSPEAKER_05:  actual \nSPEAKER_05:  foot measurement. \nSPEAKER_05:  but whatever the configuration is. \nSPEAKER_05:  if we are at four-foot social distancing. \nSPEAKER_05:  We \nSPEAKER_05:  we know. \nSPEAKER_05:  be able to retain 75%. \nSPEAKER_05:  inventions that we plug. \nSPEAKER_05:  However, if it's six feet social distancing. \nSPEAKER_05:  We will only be able to retain. \nSPEAKER_05:  25% of those conventions. \nSPEAKER_05:  or an additional loss of 4 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  Our hope is, of course, that we can come to some solutions. \nSPEAKER_05:  keeping the yet with safe standards. \nSPEAKER_05:  We know that being safe is paramount. \nSPEAKER_05:  and we believe there are some solutions to do that. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so those have been pro offered also to \nSPEAKER_05:  In phase four, the other questions are in addition to the Convention Center at individual hotels. \nSPEAKER_05:  When will the size of gatherings be given? \nSPEAKER_05:  As we went into this, we had 250 people maximum. \nSPEAKER_05:  that it was reduced down to 50, then 10. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the question is, will it be... \nSPEAKER_05:  Converse. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll be saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  groups of 250 and then pop. \nSPEAKER_05:  on our board. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that way in house meetings can occur in hotels. \nSPEAKER_05:  and they can start. \nSPEAKER_05:  until the convention centers across the state. \nSPEAKER_05:  are committed to Rio. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  These guidelines are critical. \nSPEAKER_05:  This summer we still need to tell our clients. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh \nSPEAKER_05:  position of our city. \nSPEAKER_05:  and for the fall. \nSPEAKER_05:  We \nSPEAKER_05:  sooner. \nSPEAKER_05:  better because the fall is when the \nSPEAKER_05:  Jordy of our \nSPEAKER_05:  conventions are \nSPEAKER_05:  and our clients do need to know \nSPEAKER_05:  what we're thinking and hopefully \nSPEAKER_05:  I will be able to do these things. \nSPEAKER_05:  have faced more met, but if not, \nSPEAKER_05:  They do need the privilege and the respect. \nSPEAKER_05:  being told \nSPEAKER_05:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_05:  We won't be able to accommodate them so they can make alternative. \nSPEAKER_05:  physical distancing just to show what it looks like. These are setups, mock setups that we've done at the convention center. \nSPEAKER_05:  to show what it looks like. \nSPEAKER_05:  basically in following these. \nSPEAKER_05:  You go, for example, in this scenario. \nSPEAKER_05:  96 seats is a normal capacity. \nSPEAKER_05:  At six feet, it drops down to 32 feet. \nSPEAKER_05:  So you can see the amount of distancing makes a huge difference. \nSPEAKER_05:  into how we conduct our business. \nSPEAKER_05:  and how, quite honestly, \nSPEAKER_05:  we bring people in. We also know that not everyone will be coming to these conventions. \nSPEAKER_05:  this year. \nSPEAKER_05:  However, \nSPEAKER_05:  That factored in. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're looking anywhere from a 30 to 40 percent drop. \nSPEAKER_05:  in attendance. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the hope is that as we do this, we will be able to accommodate these. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yine d\u00fc\u015fece\u011fini... \nSPEAKER_05:  We also \nSPEAKER_05:  of talk with the management. \nSPEAKER_05:  about and also with others about. \nSPEAKER_05:  securing some pented areas. \nSPEAKER_05:  so that in essence we grow. \nSPEAKER_05:  the space of the convention center. \nSPEAKER_05:  for possibly the next 12 months. \nSPEAKER_05:  so that we are minimizing the number of groups that are forced to leave on each. \nSPEAKER_05:  due to these social spacing. \nSPEAKER_05:  requirement. \nSPEAKER_05:  And this is just one example. \nSPEAKER_05:  of when there was a tent on the plaza of the fountain that's \nSPEAKER_05:  and thousands where a feed. \nSPEAKER_05:  The other space is behind the arena. \nSPEAKER_05:  whichever looks to hide. \nSPEAKER_05:  and there's also some conversation. \nSPEAKER_05:  possibly intending off the code. \nSPEAKER_05:  down there on C sideway. \nSPEAKER_05:  Lastly, in our committee, there is also discussion by the restaurant tours. \nSPEAKER_05:  and uh... \nSPEAKER_05:  about concern and Bob. \nSPEAKER_05:  Marifoster mentioned this as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Many of them are having challenges with \nSPEAKER_05:  their rent is in decrease, their insurance costs aren't \nSPEAKER_05:  Please. \nSPEAKER_05:  and it. \nSPEAKER_05:  They are making 3-5% margins. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so therefore they can't open. \nSPEAKER_05:  There is a story running the post. \nSPEAKER_05:  about this. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  to date. \nSPEAKER_05:  We've heard of \nSPEAKER_05:  15 or so restaurants, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  can't open. \nSPEAKER_05:  with reducing the capacity of the restaurant. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that's another issue we have to work through. \nSPEAKER_05:  and it could. \nSPEAKER_05:  Sadly, also causes to lose some \nSPEAKER_05:  the longstanding restaurants that we've had in our city. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  So these are the issues we have to face with most importantly for us quite honestly. \nSPEAKER_06:  So these are the issues we're going to be discussing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_05:  is the quicker we get to face for. \nSPEAKER_05:  Some likelihood of one phase four will be... \nSPEAKER_05:  sooner \nSPEAKER_05:  Everyone can feel comfortable. A Facebook doesn't happen to fall. \nSPEAKER_05:  There will be this restaurant, especially around the convention center. \nSPEAKER_05:  have said that it would be very difficult for them. \nSPEAKER_05:  to make it through to January. \nSPEAKER_05:  So for us. \nSPEAKER_05:  It is important that we open up soon. \nSPEAKER_05:  So Vice Chair, actually Chair Richards, and thank you so much for asking. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's your part of this. \nSPEAKER_05:  We hope we use. \nSPEAKER_05:  Shown. \nSPEAKER_05:  Council members. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh \nSPEAKER_05:  What's in front of us? We've been able to save. \nSPEAKER_05:  over 30% of our conventions and move them. \nSPEAKER_05:  into the fall and next year. \nSPEAKER_05:  And today we also just announced \nSPEAKER_05:  another 6000 roommate program. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we won over another major city. \nSPEAKER_05:  for 2024, so we're still looking future years. \nSPEAKER_05:  But for us, it's just getting \nSPEAKER_05:  through the next 12 lines and maintaining as much physical. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we've already put on the \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, thank you, President Goodling. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think your presentation was very comprehensive. \nSPEAKER_06:  you were able to play. \nSPEAKER_06:  numbers and projections on. \nSPEAKER_06:  the framework that the governor submitted. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that's important as we make decisions to understand what those economic impacts are. \nSPEAKER_06:  We also understand the interconnectedness our city's economy. \nSPEAKER_06:  Our bottom line is \nSPEAKER_06:  directly related to tourism. These are thousands of local jobs. \nSPEAKER_06:  millions of dollars of revenue directly to our general fund. \nSPEAKER_06:  and to our local economy. Restaurants, hotels. \nSPEAKER_06:  all of these issues. So thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_06:  for the presentation. \nSPEAKER_06:  Did you submit the presentation to the clerk so we can have it on file? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes it is. \nSPEAKER_06:  Great. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  This work phase of the meeting is really about listening. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I want to give are there any burning questions of the committee members? \nSPEAKER_06:  Otherwise, we'll go to a vote and kind of reserve our comments to the end or any burning questions for speed what we have on. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  have one back. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  You recognize. \nSPEAKER_04:  The impacts are going to be brutal for Long Beach in the next couple of months until we get to face for it. \nSPEAKER_04:  There are some states right now that are opening up. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm just concerned about maybe losing. \nSPEAKER_04:  Convention, what would normally be coming here? \nSPEAKER_04:  going to other states and the competition. \nSPEAKER_04:  with just be good for us and you're... \nSPEAKER_04:  where I see the rises to the clouds points. \nSPEAKER_04:  that would normally be here to understand. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks for Bruno for that question. \nSPEAKER_05:  That was actually brought up yesterday in our committee meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the likelihood is it's \nSPEAKER_05:  is that if a client goes to another state, \nSPEAKER_05:  We have to work harder to get them back. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so therefore it does pose a challenge. \nSPEAKER_05:  The other thing is for pleasure travel this summer. \nSPEAKER_05:  if \nSPEAKER_05:  We are not permitting. \nSPEAKER_05:  people to use our swimming pools and hotels. \nSPEAKER_05:  Again, we come off the shopping list. \nSPEAKER_05:  other surrounding counties. \nSPEAKER_05:  are permitting people in their swimming pools. \nSPEAKER_05:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  We need, we really do need guidance. \nSPEAKER_05:  on what our product is, we know. \nSPEAKER_05:  We do know our product is going to be safe. \nSPEAKER_05:  for both employees and guests. \nSPEAKER_05:  All the major brands, clients. \nSPEAKER_05:  Married exciting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Have... \nSPEAKER_05:  their own programs and convention center. \nSPEAKER_05:  managed by SM Global has come out with its program. \nSPEAKER_05:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_05:  These are strong programs. They're basically hospital disinfectant. \nSPEAKER_05:  areettle343 \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  in terms of summer travel, which is important. \nSPEAKER_05:  We want them here in Long Beach versus the worst out of us. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we need to make sure that \nSPEAKER_05:  they do have a what would \nSPEAKER_05:  fitter to be. \nSPEAKER_05:  a normal experience, a little bit by the poor, by the poor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  and throughout social distancing. \nSPEAKER_05:  But still do do. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  But our convention, Roberto, really are the key. And this is where we start. \nSPEAKER_05:  We will be able to keep these folks. \nSPEAKER_05:  and it. \nSPEAKER_05:  That is another one of our concerns because once we lose them, \nSPEAKER_05:  even the hair and beauty show in January. \nSPEAKER_05:  which is one of our largest conventions of the year. \nSPEAKER_05:  They're even asking questions about January. \nSPEAKER_00:  You're even asking. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  we are in the exhibit space. \nSPEAKER_05:  what they have. \nSPEAKER_05:  how much space between exhibits is. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's a lot of new watches and details. \nSPEAKER_05:  that need to be flushed out. \nSPEAKER_05:  need to do it collectively. \nSPEAKER_05:  and quite honestly, we need to do it. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it's Bluetooth at the multiplicity red You can see they can get the script and correct the Richmond PK only if you're avery appropriate movie shane \nSPEAKER_05:  for martyrs, it should be sufficient. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you so much, Steve. I have to say this is probably the most distinct. \nSPEAKER_06:  CVB presentation, C Goodlings show, we've ever seen. Thank you so much for being. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ah, ah, ah. \nSPEAKER_06:  effective and efficient with your time and thanks for those. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, what? \nSPEAKER_06:  chairman \nSPEAKER_03:  for your content, thank you and thanks for sharing a topic, where we will present together more than seeing the picture on the screen. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, baby. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just two comments. I know that there's a lot of questions out there about \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Tourism versus convention business. And so just a thought on some investment and that. And then also, there's a lot of talk about. \nSPEAKER_03:  organizations that can help with digital conferences. So if you're hosting the conference here with 250 people, even though you have 2500 members, do you offer a component to broadcast and allow that at an affordable price? And so that's just some of what we're hearing from the conferences that I was scheduled to go to that are canceled now. And so I don't know where our technology is on that, but something to consider as a \nSPEAKER_03:  and add on. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  fight your mango, some of our conventions. \nSPEAKER_05:  First of all, we have the capacity. \nSPEAKER_05:  and the capability to do that. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that's left up to the convention planner themselves. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. And they are driving it. \nSPEAKER_05:  I honestly \nSPEAKER_05:  It reminds me of the Ted Model when we hosted the Ted Conference. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  We had 6,000 people, but the rest. \nSPEAKER_05:  fine. \nSPEAKER_05:  But our goal, quite honestly, is to continue to bring more people back. \nSPEAKER_05:  So then. \nSPEAKER_05:  They do infiltrate. \nSPEAKER_05:  surrounding areas in the business. \nSPEAKER_05:  Of course. \nSPEAKER_06:  Of course. \nSPEAKER_05:  But we are ready. We have the pipeline. \nSPEAKER_05:  In the Convention Center, we have the Broadband capacity. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh \nSPEAKER_05:  We're ready if that's what a client desires. \nSPEAKER_05:  and we can effectively do them. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right, I think it's important people know that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, our Vice Chair Monson. Thank you, Councilmember Joranga. I'll make a motion receiving file to report. \nSPEAKER_06:  Your second? \nSPEAKER_03:  Second. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. The move in seconded. Let's have a roll call, vote please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Council member Yoraga. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice your mango. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, gentlemen, a little canary. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Cheroke is in."

What's that item number five, please? \nSPEAKER_04:  Item five is a recommendation to receive and file a report from Long Beach Nonprofit Partnership Executive Director, Michelle Byrley, on the status of the Nonprofit sector impacted by the COVID-19 emergency. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you and before we get started, what we've asked Ms. Byerle to do is to bring some representatives. \nSPEAKER_02:  and put together about a 15 minute presentation here for the City Council and again. \nSPEAKER_02:  The purpose here is to get these comments into the record. \nSPEAKER_02:  And to hear from some distinct \nSPEAKER_02:  point of view. \nSPEAKER_02:  from the nonprofit sector. So at this point, I'd like to welcome and thank Michelle Byerley from \nSPEAKER_02:  She's the Executive Director of the Long Beach Nonprofit Partnerships on a welcome you and hand the floor over to you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you so much and thank you for having us here today. \nSPEAKER_05:  I just want to really invite it. Thank you for inviting us because you are making space to hear how different parts of the economy are being impacted by the current emergency and how as a city we're really looking to the future. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I want to thank you for including the nonprofit perspective in particular. We make up many subsets of service areas and are really part of the engine that keeps the city of Long Beach going. And we're not always at the table when decisions and recommendations about the local relief effort are being made. And we want to recognize your forward thinking in that. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Non-profit is pretty countless essential services to the community and they play a critical role in the economy employing one in 14 people in the state of California, and they're the fourth largest employer by industry in California as well with over 400 operating non-profits just here in the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for allowing us to invite some nonprofits here. So shortly, you'll be hearing directly from the nonprofit leaders who are running long-distance-based organizations. \nSPEAKER_05:  Before I turn it over to them, I wanted to emphasize the fact that nonprofits are currently losing a significant amount of revenue. \nSPEAKER_05:  and those losses directly affect the communities that they serve. \nSPEAKER_05:  nonprofits have experienced a pandemic in different ways from completely halting services like our arts organizations who have suffered devastating losses and closures. \nSPEAKER_05:  to those who have quickly shifted in emergency responses and they're utilizing a significant portion of their operating funds to meet all those emerging needs. \nSPEAKER_05:  Let's see if I can share here. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  There we go. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  We were able to pull some data together in the last couple of days. Over the past few days, we have collected data on the economic impact. No profits are facing. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  So far, and this is just long-reach specific nonprofits, over 75% have experienced significant revenue losses from fee-for-service programming, and 74% have had a reduction in workforce. \nSPEAKER_05:  86% of nonprofits have experienced a loss in grant and fundraising dollars. And with only a handful of those reporting actual numbers, there's a loss of $4.7 million in county. \nSPEAKER_05:  This money is the money that provides unrestricted operating funds to our organizations and the revenue that can't be made up with future fee for service programming or loan. \nSPEAKER_05:  So relief programs that are available for small businesses that have been opened up for nonprofits and we know the city of Long Beach has done that as well and we thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are still that group of nonprofits that many don't have the structure, the relationships with their banks or lenders or the ability to use those COVID related resources. So we want to continue to keep in my nonprofits when we're putting forward relief efforts. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm going to stop sharing. Second. \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know how to stop sharing, but if someone over there can do it, I'll just keep talking. So we want to remember that what lies beyond the figures are those organizations that are on the front lines of service, organizations who impact the lives of our seniors, our children, our youth, our families, and the well-being of the community. \nSPEAKER_05:  While we are bracing for those big impacts in our sector, and we've already seen some of those as I've shared. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  Our local nonprofit economy and local organizations are also thinking of new ways to come back. \nSPEAKER_05:  Every local leader we've talked to and I've talked to personally over the last six weeks knows that we can't go back to business as usual and and it'll be sometime before we do that. \nSPEAKER_05:  As we imagine what post-pandemic Long Beach looks like, we know it involves more collaboration with each other. \nSPEAKER_05:  more communication, innovative ways to include more disenfranchised communities in our local economy, and local public and private systems. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now, profits are innovative. We're not afraid to think outside the box. And we do so to survive and to advocate for our communities every day. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I am really grateful that my fellow nonprofit leaders have joined me here today. And they're going to share from their own perspective. They have stories to share and we know stories are powerful, especially when we're talking about what's affecting our community. They're going to share how they're being impacted and how the communities they serve are navigating through these challenges. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  With that, I know I'm going to introduce them as a group and then we'll call them one by one. But we have Katherine Miles, executive director of the Jewish Children and Family Services, John Rodriguez CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach and Susanna's names. \nSPEAKER_05:  Executive Director of United Kim Boathing. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  I... \nSPEAKER_05:  Mr. Chair, did you want to call them individually or I can invite them each to speak? \nSPEAKER_02:  I think you're doing a great job, Mr. Hay. Hey. Let's go. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, so Catherine, if you want to go first, this is Catherine Madness Executive Director of Jewish Children and Family Services. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, Chair Richardson, Vice Chair Mungo, and Councilmember Uringa. I'm Katherine Miles, Executive Director of Jewish Family and Children's Service. \nSPEAKER_06:  For those of you who may not be aware, JFCF provides counseling, domestic violence, education and prevention. \nSPEAKER_06:  case management, and emergency, financial and food assistance to residents in Long Beach and surrounding communities. \nSPEAKER_06:  We serve people of all ages, faiths and ethnicities on a sliding fee scale, with many of our services provided at no cost. \nSPEAKER_06:  On an annual basis, our team provides over 10,000 hours of service, and 85% of our clients are considered low income. \nSPEAKER_06:  For the last 62 years, we have operated as a high touch human service organization with a face-to-face business model. \nSPEAKER_06:  However, since March 19th, we have been operating remotely. \nSPEAKER_06:  Over the course of seven days, we rewrote policies, procedures, and consent forms. \nSPEAKER_06:  In addition to all of our existing services, we quickly identified additional needs in the community. We began coordinating volunteers to shop for and deliver groceries to seniors who were unable to safely shop on their own. \nSPEAKER_06:  We launched a virtual support group for individuals looking for connection during this challenging time. \nSPEAKER_06:  Not surprisingly, our requests for financial assistance have increased by 30% over the same time frame last year. \nSPEAKER_06:  and our requests for food have more than double. \nSPEAKER_06:  None of this comes without financial implication. And we see the direct impact for both our clients and our donors. \nSPEAKER_06:  It hits nonprofits like ours from all sides. We were not set up to work remotely. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we've incurred unexpected expenses to ensure that we have secure. \nSPEAKER_06:  HIPAA compliant technology solutions in place. \nSPEAKER_06:  Many of our clients who are low income were already receiving counseling on a reduced fee. \nSPEAKER_06:  They've lost their jobs and have asked for a further fee reduction or to be placed on a payment plan once they begin working again. \nSPEAKER_06:  Our fee for service income is down more than 38% when compared to March and April of last year. \nSPEAKER_06:  As a nonprofit, we rely heavily on fundraising efforts. \nSPEAKER_06:  So this coming Sunday, we were scheduled to hold our 32nd annual race with the view of 5K 10 Kaie to kick off mental health awareness month. \nSPEAKER_06:  This is one of three fund reasons we hold each year to raise unrestricted funds that allow us to keep the doors open. \nSPEAKER_06:  This year we shifted to a virtual race that will run the entire month of May. \nSPEAKER_06:  To date, our fundraising is down almost 40% over last year. \nSPEAKER_06:  Several donors and local small businesses that typically support the race have reached out to share that they're unable to do so this year to do their own financial challenges. \nSPEAKER_06:  I do not believe we will be able to make up the gap. \nSPEAKER_06:  Fundraising will not look the same in the foreseeable future as nonprofit organizations are forced to shift away from large events and gatherings and many donors find themselves unable to donate at previous levels. \nSPEAKER_06:  Personally, I do not believe we have yet reached the height of requests for assistance that will come in as a result of this pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we are far from it. \nSPEAKER_06:  When the city begins to emerge from the stay-at-home order and the moratorium on evictions and utility shut offs is lifted, the request for assistance that nonprofits receive will increase exponentially as people attempt to attempt to catch up on their outstanding rent and bills. \nSPEAKER_06:  The impact of this collective trauma on the mental health and physical well-being of our community will be long lasting and far reaching. \nSPEAKER_06:  Non-profit organizations will play a key role in stabilizing our city, but so part will be needed in many areas including funds to help make people's basic needs such as food and housing. \nSPEAKER_06:  coordinated communication efforts amongst nonprofits and the community and technological solutions that support long-term remote service provision as we know that things will not be turning returning to normal any time soon. \nSPEAKER_06:  This is just one snapshot of how the nonprofit sector has been impacted by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  I really appreciate having the opportunity to share with you today and I thank you for your. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you so much, Katherine. \nSPEAKER_02:  for your comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I know we, Michelle, we have two more. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, uh, yes, I want to. \nSPEAKER_02:  just as a good manager of time. \nSPEAKER_02:  I remind folks. \nSPEAKER_02:  that we want to get as much confidence possible. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so, Don. \nSPEAKER_02:  I thank you. Your next. \nSPEAKER_02:  And down up next. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for having me. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm taking a quick break. I'm having a legacy of ways in just the Long Beach that will have a different location to your Long Beach. And I'm going to close the bottom down to start with the Iran school sites, partner with Long Beach by school district. \nSPEAKER_01:  But we did it right away and started working with Memorial Hospital and working with the children from the medical personnel and also first responders and all essential services. \nSPEAKER_01:  We had it put in a different way. So it's been, we had to open up earlier in the morning. We opened up at six o'clock in the morning. We go to 6.30 at night to accommodate their needs. We have maxed out one of our facilities and are opening up. But we just opened up another one this week, which we know will probably max out that within the, within the next week or two. It's made it because we've had to, we've had to cut down on the occupancy at those facilities. We've also opened up one of our facilities or gyms to, to the city to have a shelter there. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as soon as we can get that back, we can start serving more kids there. We've had to do virtual programming that we were not prepared for, which costs us money to make sure that we're able to service the kids. And we've also done some food distribution along with the school and art supplies giveaway. The financial impact has been great. And then we've had to check the council. \nSPEAKER_01:  three of our big events that were coming up for the end of the year and we're having to serve less kids with more staff in a safe way. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're not sure how we're going to be able to come up with that. \nSPEAKER_01:  what it's going to look like when we're able to open up. We are concerned about the mental health of the children that we serve and the situations that they're in now. It's one of the reasons why we left one of our sites open. So they would have a safe place to go or phone number to call when they've been so any of these situations are going on. But moving forward, if we open up, we don't know if we're having enough space to handle all the kids. \nSPEAKER_01:  And also how we could partner with Long Beach Unified on how they come back is a way that we could partner closer with them or part of some wreck to be able to service as many kids as possible with the \nSPEAKER_01:  less money than we normally have. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for giving me the opportunity. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Don. Thank you, Don. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  I certainly understand the impacts given. \nSPEAKER_02:  your connection with youth in the school district impacts. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then next, it looks like we have Susanna Sneen, executive director of... \nSPEAKER_02:  United Cambodian community and before you start, I don't want to just mention, I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but Don is the director of the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach. I just want to list that up because I think it may not have come out, but \nSPEAKER_02:  The Boyd and Girls Club along beach through Don Represents and it's an important perspective. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's a brain. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next we have Savannah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Council Member. I just want to echo the same thank you to the committee and the city staff for the leadership and really helping support community members during this difficult time. I want to share more about the internal impacts of COVID-19 onto UCC in our operations, but also in the Kimboden community. \nSPEAKER_00:  So UCC has been serving the Kimbo to Kimi for over 40 years. And our mission is to elevate the Kimbo to Kimi, the local engagement and leadership that embodies Kimbo to cultural values. During this time, our biggest impact to UCC is to our general operating funds of income and expenses. And so with UCC, we are considered one of the smaller nonprofits with a budget of less than $1 million. And with that, 70% of our funds are from \nSPEAKER_00:  private foundations, 20% from government contracts and 10% from fundraising. And like others, what they have shared, we're not doing our annual fundraiser, which usually raises about 5% of our budget of our head funds. In addition, we understand that a lot of our private foundations are shifting their funding priorities to better address COVID-19 relief. And so that's something that we also have to consider and we strategize of how what services UCC is providing so that we can best provide these needs within the Cambodian community. The other piece is that there is a lot of overhead expenses that we were not anticipating because UCC is closing down our offices to the public since March 13th and moved into remote work. And we're finding challenges with that too because \nSPEAKER_00:  We're trying to provide services over the phone to our population, which majority of our clients, 50 over 50% are limited English speakers, and we're verifying these services over the phone, and trying to do our best online. The biggest gap that we see within our community is that the Kimbona community has a huge digital divide, and in which there's poor digital literacy. And so even just trying to support our community members to get connected to Facebook, it takes about an hour or two hours to get them set up on a Facebook account, set up an email, all those pieces, and help them get connected to the resources that are mainly through digital channels. And so that's our biggest challenge is being able to navigate online resources with our community members through their phone. \nSPEAKER_00:  The other piece that I really want to highlight is the impact on our minority-owned small businesses. UCC, we have a business center and we've been supporting small businesses for the past three years. And during COVID-19, we really tried to help the small businesses gain access to loans. And so we helped over 30 businesses access loans during this time. However, only two of them received confirmation that they received their application with the banks. And so that's not even. \nSPEAKER_00:  letting them know that they have been approved for alone. And so that's our biggest challenge, is that a lot of our small businesses. \nSPEAKER_00:  These loans are not a good fit for them and would rather need micro grants in order to support and sustain these small businesses moving forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  The other piece that I would like to highlight is the challenges when it comes to our low income families. \nSPEAKER_00:  We understand that right now there is an immoratorium on evictions and for those that are not able to pay their rents, but eventually they do need to pay their rent. And so that's what we're preparing for at UCC is if there's any ways that we can provide rental assistance funds to our community members so that they're able to make rent and be able to stay in their homes and stay in Long Beach. I just want to close with \nSPEAKER_00:  an imagery that someone has shared with me about the COVID-19 situation that we're all in the same storm that we're experiencing the same storm but we're in different boats and so I just want to really encourage equity as you're thinking about resources within the community and to build the capacity of minority businesses and communities of color during this time. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Thank you, Susanna. And I think all of your testimonies were incredible. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I want to pass it. And I thought that I felt that was a really strong close. \nSPEAKER_02:  on the terms of your analogy about where all experience and things storm. \nSPEAKER_02:  I want to go back to Michelle. Michelle, if any, including comments that you might have on this presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that was great. I just want to thank you again for including this perspective. Nonprofits are helping all corners of the community including businesses. And so again, you know, I know there's a lot of different task force and others that are thinking about recovery. So our nonprofits are ready to be a part of those as well. So we just want to \nSPEAKER_05:  Make it known that we're there to support those efforts. And thank you again for including us today. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Michelle. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman committee members what we're going to do is we're going to \nSPEAKER_02:  Keep our comments and we'll have a final opportunity to come in after we hear these next three. \nSPEAKER_02:  speakers and so I would ask that your comments that you add are at the very end. We're almost there. We want to respect the love. \nSPEAKER_02:  our final of three. \nSPEAKER_02:  speaker. So at this point I want to go ahead and both receive and file this. So I'll make the motion receive and file is our second. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, seconded by Council Member. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh, Uranga. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's go ahead and have the roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  Council Member Uraga? \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  \u2013 if you're vice-chairmango. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right, Chairman Mungo, we can't hear you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, let's continue. \nSPEAKER_04:  Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm an eye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I've just heard Council Member Mungo with a nice."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  receive motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Number six, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Item 6 is a recommendation to receive and follow report from local business owners on the status of the restaurant sector impacted by the COVID-19 emergency. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. And for this section, we acquired with each of the members of the committee to \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, app. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a local restaurant. Come on and share about three to five minutes each on. \nSPEAKER_03:  are the way that they've been impacted any thoughts that they might have. \nSPEAKER_03:  on the way that anything that we should consider as we discuss the reopening. \nSPEAKER_03:  To start, I'll ask Vice-Tier Mungo to introduce \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  A Baja through Europe \nSPEAKER_03:  speaker, we have Mary Sophia. Do you want to introduce her? Spacing. \nSPEAKER_05:  I just want to say it out of big appreciation for Mary even though she is going through a lot as a business. She's still out there supporting our first responders. I also think it's really important to recognize that the delicious food of Vahasinara can be delivered to your home via Postmates or Uber Eats or you can do a call in and they have very. \nSPEAKER_05:  appropriate. \nSPEAKER_05:  distance scene for pickup. \nSPEAKER_05:  But with that, Mary, thank you for all you're doing. It was hard to choose a business. We have so many good ones in the fifth district right now. I'm helping out with everything and we look forward to your perspectives. \nSPEAKER_04:  I hope you can hear me. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, we can hear you. Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  And thank you, Stacy, that was... \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm going to use that as one of my ads. \nSPEAKER_04:  That was great. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not quite sure what \nSPEAKER_04:  you. \nSPEAKER_04:  are looking for in our perspective obviously. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's been very difficult. We've been, we hung on to almost all of our employees. \nSPEAKER_04:  I believe that. \nSPEAKER_04:  We need to look at. \nSPEAKER_04:  how to handle landlords. \nSPEAKER_04:  at this point. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I don't know if that's appropriate at this time. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can someone let me know? \nSPEAKER_03:  Certainly. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we receive that comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. We'll make sure that that is reflected that. \nSPEAKER_03:  on issues with landlords and and tenants. \nSPEAKER_03:  particularly commercial tenants. \nSPEAKER_03:  need to be considered as we factor in the reopening. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can't tell you. \nSPEAKER_03:  is that the eviction moratorium put in place by the City Council did apply to both commercial. \nSPEAKER_03:  and residential and I would ask. \nSPEAKER_03:  economic development staff to reach out to you and make sure that we \nSPEAKER_03:  give you the resources that are there. I would just say while we still have a little bit of time with you, I just by do you have any \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  What do you have any thought? \nSPEAKER_03:  or considerations about. \nSPEAKER_03:  what it's going to require for your business, the pencil. \nSPEAKER_03:  for your business appentals. \nSPEAKER_03:  If as we make decisions about how to reopen while respecting \nSPEAKER_03:  social distancing. \nSPEAKER_03:  perhaps limiting occupancy or queuing services or continuing and engaging delivering services. Delivery services. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just, I just \nSPEAKER_03:  I just had a... \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I just had a very long \nSPEAKER_04:  talk with an attorney today and my business partner and of course. \nSPEAKER_04:  the fosters and what we put in. \nSPEAKER_04:  What with \nSPEAKER_04:  That was that we would put if we had to come down to let's say 32 people. \nSPEAKER_04:  bottom line as we probably would have to raise our prices. \nSPEAKER_04:  and or put a surge on and I think our town our city is so wonderful. I think that they would support that they'll be so glad to get out. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  and into sitting into a restaurant. So that's one of my thoughts and I'm also approaching the landlord about \nSPEAKER_04:  about doing half. \nSPEAKER_04:  letting us have 25 to 30% off our rent for a while. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have forgiven, not. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, the other way. \nSPEAKER_04:  But um. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, there's talk about... \nSPEAKER_04:  having them fill out. \nSPEAKER_04:  as they come in. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I don't know how this would work. Have them fill out. \nSPEAKER_04:  piece of paper. \nSPEAKER_04:  with their name, email, phone number. \nSPEAKER_04:  and God forbid something happens, or they get sick, or we can reach them and then reach the other patrons that have come in. \nSPEAKER_04:  but we're still pinching it out. I... \nSPEAKER_04:  Equipped both delivery service and at least 32 patrons with our prices raised. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that's a good start. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think you've contributed some good feedback here. We'll make sure we continue the conversation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Mary. Thank you so much for having me. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much for your time. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll make sure we also. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll make sure we have the, or \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Absolutely. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. So that was Mary Sophia from Baja Senura. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next, counseling your roundout. Would you like to take a moment to introduce Blackbird Cafe? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next person who is Debbie Rosetti, Colossian. \nSPEAKER_02:  and representing the Blackbird Cafe today. \nSPEAKER_02:  The library cafe is located on the corner of a... \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll close this corner. I'm going orange. \nSPEAKER_02:  in the Cahite area of my district in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  when we make a big story about likely very important work around six years ago. \nSPEAKER_02:  right before my election to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_02:  And when I was one of my first meetings with the newly elected Mayor Barbara Garcia. \nSPEAKER_02:  to the deploying APERI hallway fine \nSPEAKER_02:  I remember that the last time I started at the game was so... \nSPEAKER_02:  significance, well, we'll hear him talk about us. Talk about themilitarium. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to. \nSPEAKER_06:  give you guys some insight on my business. We're a small cafe with street parking. We see about 50 people inside with some sidewalk patio seating outdoors. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  And now we're just taking takeout only. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, before, before this all happened, our takeout revenue was about 10%. And now we're doing about 30%. So we've seen. \nSPEAKER_06:  a decline for sure. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think \nSPEAKER_06:  I would feel comfortable. \nSPEAKER_06:  in opening up and having. \nSPEAKER_06:  customers come in if we can just number one do it right the first time. \nSPEAKER_06:  And if \nSPEAKER_06:  We have vaccinations. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm very concerned about people. \nSPEAKER_06:  getting sick. I'm concerned about my employees. Also, \nSPEAKER_06:  Liabilities, I don't want to get sued if someone thinks they contracted something. \nSPEAKER_06:  So. \nSPEAKER_06:  Those are some of my concerns. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, thank you, Debbie, for those. \nSPEAKER_03:  concerns I will make sure that those are considered recognized as we \nSPEAKER_03:  report back to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know your business. I know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Black bird cafe I get it when I used to get my haircut I used to get my haircut right across the street at Emily's there barbershop \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for all the cool Chief Mill. \nSPEAKER_03:  That same building. \nSPEAKER_03:  That same building used to be an office I worked in. \nSPEAKER_03:  Many, many years ago when I first moved to Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  where your restaurant is. So I'm very familiar and I'll frequently restaurant. \nSPEAKER_03:  pretty regularly. So thank you so much for joining us. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sharon. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you very much. Okay, so next, I'll introduce the next. \nSPEAKER_03:  next business. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  I wanted to select the business with multiple sites across the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we, so I asked \nSPEAKER_03:  Luis Navarro, owner of \nSPEAKER_03:  um, um, Lola's Mexican cuisine as well as \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  Your the new distillery Portuguese band. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we wanted to invite him to share some perspectives given. \nSPEAKER_03:  He has multiple restaurants. \nSPEAKER_03:  investment in the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  So Luis, are you still here on the line? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, I'm here. \nSPEAKER_01:  here. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Luis, go ahead and share it from your perspectives with the committee. You will. \nSPEAKER_03:  please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Absolutely. Thank you, Council Member Richardson and Councilwoman Mungo. \nSPEAKER_01:  for inviting me. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we're a little bit unique. You know, we have four restaurants sprawled out throughout the city. We're currently working with three different bids, you know, working with the Forestry Business Corridor. \nSPEAKER_01:  with Blair Cone up in Big Speed Noles and also with Craig Cogen in downtown Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've been extremely busy trying to just figure things out. Aside of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  also working with Mayor Foster on the economic recovery task force. \nSPEAKER_01:  But you know, some of the things that have been kicked around and that we're discussing and rigorously working on. \nSPEAKER_01:  is \nSPEAKER_01:  how will we recover, you know, and how will business be? \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  once these quarantines are lifted. And first off from foremost, I believe that the public must feel safe. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the public feeling safe, that's going to alleviate a lot of the challenges I think that are going to be posed. \nSPEAKER_01:  specifically to the restaurant business, but really to every small business, including barber shops and nail salons. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other thing is, you know, how are we going to roll this thing out? \nSPEAKER_01:  And I don't think that you could exactly put a number on it. You know, I know that a lot of people are talking about 25% occupancy. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  50% occupancy, you know, I believe that there shouldn't be an occupancy limit place. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I think that as small business operators, as Debbie just mentioned, we're all concerned about, \nSPEAKER_01:  the consumer, we're concerned about our employees, and at the same time, we're concerned about ourselves, our well-being. So I think that everybody would be responsible to do the six foot distancing, disinfecting, and doing all the protocols that need to be put in place. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, as Mary mentioned, yeah, if we were to be, um, \nSPEAKER_01:  Really? \nSPEAKER_01:  kind of drip fetters strangled at a specific occupancy. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not... \nSPEAKER_01:  economically feasible to sustain. And the reason being is, you know, you have all your hard costs that are set. You know, you have your liabilities and assurances and you have your workman's comps and \nSPEAKER_01:  your lease payments and all that's calculated off of your sales. So, you know, right now I think anybody that has been able to sustain has a pretty decent takeout. \nSPEAKER_01:  delivery service working model. \nSPEAKER_01:  Obviously, the ABC situation with us being able to sell cocktails to go has been huge. I haven't heard anybody of trying to stop that, but I think that that is a huge component in order for us to continue to be able to just stay alive. \nSPEAKER_01:  But with that, you know, I think that we also need to get into the discussion of \nSPEAKER_01:  you know the delivery platforms. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  they're great, you know, and without them, you know, I don't think that we could get in front of, as many folks as we're able to get in front of, but the fees, you know, I mean, I know at Lola's, you know, we've got contracts with them. We're paying about 20%. Portuguese bend, we had to, you know, adapt and get those going, and we're paying about 30% off the top of that. So if there could be some sort of, \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know the proper word, but if it would be litigation or something where \nSPEAKER_01:  we can get some help, some sort of ease off of those platforms to maybe at least cut their fees in half during the recovery process. I think that would help most restaurants as a whole in a long term. And last, you know, that way I don't wanna talk everybody's year off, but one of the biggest challenges that I think everybody is seeing down the pipeline and I'm talking with this to various colleagues and there's been some big articles coming out is also the threat of frivolous lawsuits exposing the small businesses. As we roll out, somebody comes in, somebody gets infected, having for bid, an employee gets infected, what does that look like? Are we treating it almost like a neurovirus type situation where the health department comes in, they assess the situation, are you shut down for 14 days, forced into a quarantine? There's a lot of those factors out there that I think are swirling around and I think we're all gonna need some guidance and really some assistance with that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would say \nSPEAKER_03:  I really appreciate. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  this very specific feedback that you were prepared to provide today. And it really \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  Now it cares a lot of weight. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Particularly. \nSPEAKER_03:  what you mentioned about the changing of the rules on alcohol sales and I was a significant part of \nSPEAKER_03:  a lot of restaurants. \nSPEAKER_03:  failed now column the fact that you've been able to retool. \nSPEAKER_03:  and take these relax. \nSPEAKER_03:  sort of rules, these changed rules and \nSPEAKER_03:  turn it into a way to sort of economically mitigate. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's the kind of... \nSPEAKER_03:  sort of by thinking we need to continue in order to make sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're creating opportunities. \nSPEAKER_03:  Secondly, I'm glad you raised the issue with the delivery. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  the delivery. \nSPEAKER_03:  We've heard this. \nSPEAKER_03:  from \nSPEAKER_03:  Our restaurants, I've heard it from the restaurants in North Long Beach, the Algonbo Shack, and \nSPEAKER_03:  some of the others and Robert Earl's barbecue that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Customers already pay a service charge. \nSPEAKER_03:  but these platforms are charging 25% or 30%. \nSPEAKER_03:  to the restaurant. \nSPEAKER_03:  which courses restaurant raise those prices and \nSPEAKER_03:  in this environment where we're forced to use those. \nSPEAKER_03:  some city's have taken look. \nSPEAKER_03:  some cities right here in California have taken a look at what can be done. \nSPEAKER_03:  to place caps on. \nSPEAKER_03:  delivery fee. \nSPEAKER_03:  and sort of ensure that these prices are not being gouged in the \nSPEAKER_03:  in the course of emergency. \nSPEAKER_03:  So thank you for bringing those. \nSPEAKER_03:  are raising those issues. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I want to thank all of our \nSPEAKER_03:  restaurants. Again, we have Lola's Mexican cuisine. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ah, bahas and yura. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Blackbird Cafe, we would encourage. \nSPEAKER_03:  the public to support these restaurant. \nSPEAKER_03:  And at this point, \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm gonna have. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm going to invite you all. Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would invite my committee members to share some final thoughts before we close. \nSPEAKER_03:  the meeting and we'll start with a vice chair mongo. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I really appreciate all the comments from all the participants today. I think that to Luis's point about a set percentage, I don't think that a set percentage really works, especially if you have flexible tables because \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you're a nuclear family that has... \nSPEAKER_05:  eight in your family like our neighbor does with so many children. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  and or the parents that live at home or whatever, you're going to be able to reconfigure those tables to sit that group of people close together and all of that is going to be \nSPEAKER_05:  changing on a dynamic basis. I think that we need to encourage individuals to do a better job of making reservations so that the businesses can plan better. And then I also think that when you see those service charges on postmates, then \nSPEAKER_05:  all of those different apps. \nSPEAKER_05:  It might be time for... \nSPEAKER_05:  and brains to get together and come up with a long, each exclusive app. \nSPEAKER_05:  where it's built by the restaurants and long beach, those service charges all go back to our local restaurants instead of two. \nSPEAKER_05:  The providers, what what a lot of fifth district residents have noticed is their particular restaurants where if you call and do take out it's one price, but if you use one of those apps, it's a different price. It's a higher price and they would rather tip that money directly to the \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  business. \nSPEAKER_05:  than to the app platform that's making lots of money. We want that money to stay local. So just some thought. \nSPEAKER_05:  Once again, I appreciate all of you for participating today and look forward to a time where we can all. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  be at a restaurant together. \nSPEAKER_03:  Absolutely. Thank you for those comments, Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  Council Member Uraga. \nSPEAKER_03:  Milwa Noorters. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, thank you, Rex. Thank you for putting this together. I would, it was excellent to hear from our... \nSPEAKER_02:  from our neighbors and from our businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  I've mentioned earlier the backbone of the Oval County, I have small business when I go down on. \nSPEAKER_02:  a business corridor, whether it's Atlantic, lobby school, or a chair yet, Artisia. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, what's making that with our seeing thrive are those businesses that are open. They have got to... \nSPEAKER_02:  that these individuals were late to time today. \nSPEAKER_02:  to speak with us and share their views as they stop. \nSPEAKER_02:  especially you to our India. \nSPEAKER_02:  My proper work, I feel the pain. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm the president of a nonprofit. \nSPEAKER_02:  myself, who are through the League of Cities and fundraising news. \nSPEAKER_02:  Come on show. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a very distant and it's a very hard tie way out to do that. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're looking, we're looking at that. \nSPEAKER_02:  the representatives from Blackbird and Miller, the Blackbird, say. \nSPEAKER_02:  um guacurau significa que ou\u00e7a a salada, pra na ers\u00e3o. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I really appreciate the work that they're doing. \nSPEAKER_02:  is making it more available to our \nSPEAKER_02:  most media to the community, and that would be the first thing you should do when you're in that area. \nSPEAKER_02:  long-term care facilities. But, soft, I love these deliveries. \nSPEAKER_02:  City Police, right in my district. \nSPEAKER_02:  for a food do it provided by Lolas. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in that Blackboard, we go through some of the haggles also. \nSPEAKER_02:  come into play and we're providing food for seniors as well. So I want to thank them. \nSPEAKER_02:  or their expenditure is providing these meals. \nSPEAKER_02:  for these senior citizens. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hopefully that we get this testimony, we're getting a lot more. \nSPEAKER_02:  and Chair Richard Kim, I'm sure that we're going to put all this together and we'll be talking more in your very near future about \nSPEAKER_02:  but we've heard your day from your calling hello and thank you for your call. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Council Member. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I'll offer some final comments and then we'll take this final vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we will adjourn this meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  I want to thank everyone for participating this meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know we didn't get to provide direct comments on the nonprofit portion, but I thought it was \nSPEAKER_03:  really worthwhile to hear from the Long Beach for Nonprofit Partnership and I want to thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm a shell buyer, Lee. \nSPEAKER_03:  Executive Director for helping to organize that form.
