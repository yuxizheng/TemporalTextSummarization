        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_04:  The first item on the agenda today is a study session to interview candidates from District 7, 8, and 9. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we are going to be doing that. I believe that candidates from District 7 have already joined this. \nSPEAKER_04:  part of the meeting so that we can see them. Just a few words to them and to the other applicants that are participating today. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  First of all, we really appreciate your interest in applying for the redistricting commission and \nSPEAKER_04:  We hope that \nSPEAKER_04:  Regardless of what happens in this process that you'll continue to find ways to contribute to our city. We have a very rich pool of applicants. We're happy to say. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we'll be making the final decisions when these interviews are completed in the next week or so. \nSPEAKER_04:  will then make the final decisions and then the names will be randomly drawn in accordance with the rules that were set up when the redistricting commission amendment to the charter was voted in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think you know, but there was extensive research or outreach to \nSPEAKER_04:  Find applicants received about 400 applications staff narrow those down just based on the basic qualifications such as living in Long Beach to about 350 the Commission and broken to three. \nSPEAKER_04:  ad hoc committees and \nSPEAKER_04:  reviewed the applications anonymously and chose five candidates from each district to move forward to this process, this step in the in the process. \nSPEAKER_04:  none of the commissioners considered \nSPEAKER_04:  their own district in that those subcommittee that subcommittee process. \nSPEAKER_04:  So today, \nSPEAKER_04:  And well, in these last few days, we have been interviewing the candidates from each district. \nSPEAKER_04:  The interviews will likely go on into next week because we find a few mistakes in the \nSPEAKER_04:  in the way that they are. \nSPEAKER_04:  interviews were, interviewees were invited and we'll be addressing that in the second part of this meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  The procedure for today is that each candidate has five minutes and you will answer the questions that were provided to you in advance. Those questions were selected by the commission as what would be helpful to us. \nSPEAKER_04:  And following on \nSPEAKER_04:  as each after each of you makes sure \nSPEAKER_04:  Each of you make your remarks. I will ask the commissioners if they have any follow-up questions for you that you'll then be excused and we'll go to the next the next applicant. But you can stay on the \nSPEAKER_04:  this part of the call if you wish. \nSPEAKER_04:  So with no further ado, I'm going to ask JT Nagiyama from the clerk's office to call the candidates because he has the technology at his disposal to \nSPEAKER_04:  Let you in and you do all those things. So JT. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. The first commissioner, sorry, the first applicant for today will be CD7-7, Darleen Castillo. If you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_09:  and your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_11:  Am I unmuted at this time? Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, we can. Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  I've served for 13 years as a board of director in Long Beach, the West Side Neighborhood Freaklinic. \nSPEAKER_11:  is a non-paid volunteer position. \nSPEAKER_11:  I served as a board member for the West Long Beach Association for 10 years. \nSPEAKER_11:  And two years of that was as vice president of the association. \nSPEAKER_11:  And those are my qualifications for applying in this position. I've coordinated meetings. I've reached out to Council Mayor's Office, the police department for issues that affect our seventh district here with great results. \nSPEAKER_11:  I've involved others from my neighborhood to get involved in serving in the city as well. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, my, um, the projects I've worked on. \nSPEAKER_11:  have been coordinating \nSPEAKER_11:  events with the Port of Long Beach, with memorial care, on the other hand, for the neighborhood clinic. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  Let's see who else. Oh, it had been a lot of different divisions that I've gotten in contact with to coordinate meetings. That would be the city departments building and safety. \nSPEAKER_11:  various other departments such as coordinating the rental, getting the bins for the neighborhood cleanups, coordinating those, giving the \nSPEAKER_11:  uh neighbors information on how to obtain all that and directly with city council \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about halfway there. \nSPEAKER_11:  Those are some of the projects. \nSPEAKER_08:  the project. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I've learned to kind of go well I've learned to negotiate some of these tasks with my other fellow board members meeting regularly and coordinating these events and listening and hearing and everybody gets a chance to have their input on what goes on and \nSPEAKER_11:  As far as problems go in any encounters, there have been some difficulties and they've had to be talked out. \nSPEAKER_11:  And given the opportunity for everybody to have a say and a vote on what needs to occur in the different situations. \nSPEAKER_11:  I worked well with our City Council District Office as well. I got to know them very well. Roberto Urenga's office. And they've been most helpful in directing me to where I need to go when I have questions for my own community. \nSPEAKER_11:  So, and to me, I believe that that's the most helpful source that I can get. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  to be a neighborhood leader. \nSPEAKER_11:  and someone that \nSPEAKER_11:  as the information and those where to seek it. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  When questions arise. \nSPEAKER_11:  or events occur. \nSPEAKER_11:  I enjoy doing what I do. I've lived in Long Beach since 1980. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I do have vested property here. So I do care for what's going on. As far as working in a team, I believe that we're all going to have to say so. And I expect that there probably will be with this new commission problems that will encounter. And there'll be actions to avoid and how to respond to the problems. And I believe that would be. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  letting the citizens also, if they have their concerns, let their voices be heard and not mute them to it. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thanks for having me. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thanks for having me. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Pardon me. \nSPEAKER_09:  Please wrap up your comment. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay. So. \nSPEAKER_11:  My my concern and care is for the city I live in and serve and I wish to be a part of an organization that's going to go places and do good for the city and that will be my end. \nSPEAKER_04:  Mm. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  Do any of the commissioners have questions for the candidate? Ms. Castillo. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any hands up. I don't think there's any questions. So thank you very much and we'll move on to the next candidate, please. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next applicant will be \nSPEAKER_09:  CD7-19 Frank Gutierrez, if you can unmute your mic and \nSPEAKER_09:  Begin. \nSPEAKER_00:  Let's see, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  First of all, good afternoon, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to serve a city that I absolutely love. \nSPEAKER_00:  Let me talk a little bit about the qualities that I would bring to the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  I have first-hand knowledge of all the various communities throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  based on my work with all the schools in Long Beach Unified School District. \nSPEAKER_00:  and with my participation in Leadership Law Meets program. \nSPEAKER_00:  The Leadership Law Meets Program was an amazing program that gave me an opportunity to learn. \nSPEAKER_00:  a lot about the city, great detail, and it was just an amazing program to participate. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm someone with a strong, worth it. Work ethic, I'll bring 100%. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I'll work to develop positive outcomes. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm someone that has strong interpersonal skills that I'll be able to bring and utilize people bring them together to accomplish great outcomes. I'm someone who will pay close attention to details and who thinks outside of the box and able to come up with solutions that can create win win situations for all. \nSPEAKER_00:  And the most important thing I think. \nSPEAKER_00:  is great listening skills that are critical and working to bring a group to consensus and to make sure that everyone feels like they're being heard. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  going on to products throughout my 34 years in education. I recently retired last year. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm- \nSPEAKER_00:  been involved in a lot of different projects and been on a lot of different teams. But I think the one that made the most impact. \nSPEAKER_00:  in my career when I was the new director of operations for the Long Beach Inupite School District. \nSPEAKER_00:  operations every school site has a team that works on daily maintenance and operations of the site that includes the principal. \nSPEAKER_00:  a plant supervisor, custodians and maintenance staff. \nSPEAKER_00:  As a new director, the superintendent came to me and I said, I need you to reorganize this department. It was a department that was struggling that had a lot of conflicts, had extremely low morale, had a lot of a lot of issues going on. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as a new leader of this team, I knew that I couldn't come in and just from the top saying \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  Hey, we need to do this, this, this. I needed to utilize a team approach. I had to gain the respect and I had to earn their trust. \nSPEAKER_00:  working with a team of the district administrators, plant supervisors, principals, custodians themselves. We came together, I called it advisory team, and we looked at all the different issues. \nSPEAKER_00:  They're about halfway through. Everyone had a clear voice. Everyone was equal. There were no titles. All the titles were left at the door. And we all gave input into the solutions. We did something that's called a PDSA, Plan Do Study Act, where we examined what the issues were. We came up with a plan. And then we implemented that plan. We went back to the sites. We provided training and support to make sure that everybody understood, had clear expectations. Benchmarks and then provided them with the support that they needed. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  halfway through. \nSPEAKER_00:  as a team. \nSPEAKER_00:  working together to see we're able to create. \nSPEAKER_00:  turn around the department. Today it's a very high performing department as a result of our work that morale turned 180 degrees around. \nSPEAKER_00:  The lessons that I would bring to the commission for that. \nSPEAKER_00:  is that I believe is extremely important to work as a team. \nSPEAKER_00:  that we have to show respect. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have to build trust along the way. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I strongly believe that people working as a team. \nSPEAKER_00:  can. \nSPEAKER_00:  accomplice remarkable things. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have to have having it clearly defined process for coming to consensus. \nSPEAKER_00:  and accomplishing our goals as critical to our success as a commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  As I look at our work together as a team and I've seen \nSPEAKER_00:  teams and there's always conflicts, there's always people bring their own agendas. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think it's really important that we begin with clear expectations, that we have norms established. How are we going to treat each other in the meetings? What are our expectations? Having benchmarks along the way? Looking at how we're going to evaluate our progress along the way. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I also think it's really extremely important that we recognize our successes and we celebrate our accomplishments along the way, that we really build a team approach. Throughout my years, I've been able to accomplish. \nSPEAKER_00:  great things in different positions that I've been in from being a teacher to a counselor to system principal principal district level I've been able to take \nSPEAKER_00:  My skills and build teams that really can make a difference. And I truly believe that my work and commission will bring people together and create. \nSPEAKER_00:  positive outcomes for a city that I absolutely love. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do ministers have questions from Mr. Gutierrez? \nSPEAKER_04:  and not seen any. So thank you very much. And like I said, we'll be making our decisions like probably later next week. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great, thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next applicant is CD7-28, Darlene Oliver. If you can unmute yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_07:  I specifically applauded you that I feel was making a great independent \nSPEAKER_07:  redistricting transmission. \nSPEAKER_07:  Remember. \nSPEAKER_00:  Remember. \nSPEAKER_07:  are my relevant and 11 skills. \nSPEAKER_07:  the fact that I'm impartial and I have many years of experience working collaboratively in cooperative development. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm a dispassionate logical thinker. \nSPEAKER_07:  with strong social sciences background. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have a keen sense of passage. \nSPEAKER_07:  having worked for 15 years in medical education. \nSPEAKER_07:  which has to be compliant with the whole \nSPEAKER_07:  Ammer's officeies. \nSPEAKER_07:  regulation. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm also engaged at the concerned citizen in the regular area of Long Beach, District 7, where I've lived since 2004. \nSPEAKER_07:  my high standards of F. \nSPEAKER_07:  I've recognized during my 15 years in medical education. \nSPEAKER_07:  as I was honored to be asked to serve as an independent auditor. \nSPEAKER_07:  of other organizations, and accredited medical education systems for \nSPEAKER_07:  compliance with the rules and regulations. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I did that for about 10 years. \nSPEAKER_07:  What I do for the exam and the practices of organizations. \nSPEAKER_07:  that put on medical education. \nSPEAKER_07:  and to a determined level of evidence that these organizations have a being compliant with regulation. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm not to say that this would occur as a commissioner, but \nSPEAKER_07:  I would call this a pressure to slice the guys' communities, such that one party or another is given a favored status. \nSPEAKER_07:  over any other parties. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have many years of experience with conflict resolution within the network called a critical education field. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I'm able to have open and respectful communications with people who's really different. \nSPEAKER_07:  from that of my own. \nSPEAKER_07:  I keep everyone involved in the communication. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  I know how to seek guidance for resources available, and that's not true what to do. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I know how to follow the rules, regulations. \nSPEAKER_07:  to the extent. \nSPEAKER_07:  possible if they use the democratic process. \nSPEAKER_07:  to resolve conflict. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  here. \nSPEAKER_07:  if elected. \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_07:  you would like me to describe a situation where I work collaborative. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so \nSPEAKER_07:  channel. \nSPEAKER_07:  my job of a West work with a scientific committee that's containing medical education for the city. \nSPEAKER_07:  to ensure that the education remained accredited. \nSPEAKER_07:  and we were compliant with all regulations. \nSPEAKER_07:  So in this team setting, what I would do is \nSPEAKER_07:  like. \nSPEAKER_07:  medical disclosure from the doctors, physician educators. \nSPEAKER_07:  and make sure that there were no conflicts. \nSPEAKER_07:  and in many cases, perhaps it's only 100 a year. \nSPEAKER_07:  There will be some potential clients, sorry, conflict. \nSPEAKER_07:  we take those cards. \nSPEAKER_07:  and the particular of those relationships back to the CME committee. \nSPEAKER_07:  and we would as a team discuss what could be done to \nSPEAKER_07:  education but perhaps change it. \nSPEAKER_07:  about our first sample you could work, we could have an independent medical expert work with the faculty to change some of the slides. \nSPEAKER_07:  and do some things in a slightly different way so that the roles were complied with. \nSPEAKER_07:  For in some instances we took the speaker off the agenda and put on an unbiased person. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  opposition with no commercial relationships with \nSPEAKER_07:  device mainly factors in pharmaceuticals. \nSPEAKER_07:  so this management and resolution of conflicts happened frequently. \nSPEAKER_07:  And it was my role as integral in that. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll speak to work. \nSPEAKER_07:  removed from the program I would first have to tell them that and to explain the eruption now. \nSPEAKER_07:  and all smooth over and evapotal feathers and explain the overarching goals of the education and the need to be accredited. \nSPEAKER_07:  for that. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would tell you a little bit about how I would work through conflicts that arose. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm taking it to the group. \nSPEAKER_07:  where there was a deliberation and examination with an eye towards what. \nSPEAKER_07:  What if their avenues can we take to get the education out without being in violation of any of the girls in regulation? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I wouldn't ask for the established protocols that we will and apply the prescribed technique. \nSPEAKER_07:  such that we always have the independence. \nSPEAKER_07:  criteria. Please drop up your comments. \nSPEAKER_08:  Please drop up your comments. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  The lessons I blew by would take away. Well, I have an answer that's very involved in lots of politics and tells me if I'm still the same. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would regard so much and find it such a rewarding experience. \nSPEAKER_07:  because I'm very engaged in my community. \nSPEAKER_07:  Imagine I would take away a feeling of gratitude for having been involved. \nSPEAKER_07:  and for completing a task that can be complex. \nSPEAKER_07:  ever having a sense of accomplishing the simple duty to be brought upon. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you, your time has elapsed. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do any of the commissioners have questions for Mrs. Misholver? \nSPEAKER_04:  who not seen any. Thank you very much, Miss Oliver. \nSPEAKER_04:  and we'll be making our decisions in the next week or so. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there another candidate today? \nSPEAKER_04:  from seven \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  We have applicant CD7-31. I'm sorry if I mispronounce your names. Zell it. \nSPEAKER_09:  violin tissue \nSPEAKER_01:  Zebranches. \nSPEAKER_09:  Zilla Rentes, there you go, Scott. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  There you go. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_09:  Sorry about that. \nSPEAKER_09:  You can have it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I've been getting that all my life. Okay, my name is Zealander. It's a Scott us born and raised in Long Beach, California. Currently living in the same house I was born and raised in. I graduated from Long Beach Poly high school. I went to MIT graduated with two degrees, one degree in information technology, another degree in music. I'm currently \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm a business owner in the city of Long Beach and also on serving on my son's PT board for Bixby Elementary. I'm very involved in the city of Long Beach as a board member of the Mambasa Sister City Association and I am also \nSPEAKER_01:  the Secretary of the Long Beach Sister Cities Association. \nSPEAKER_01:  And you know, one of the things that I did do after I got my \nSPEAKER_01:  bachelor's degree, I got my master's degree in public policy. So when you talk about redistricting and public policy, you know, I interned for uh, uh, Ray Gubinsky back in the day. \nSPEAKER_01:  that council district seven so I've been very passionate about you know giving back to the city that has raised me and made me who I am and one of the the specific unique qualities that I also bring is is a memory of the diversity and the joy that isn't long beach has to be the best city on the planet. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  But one of the things that \nSPEAKER_01:  I wanted to talk about it as a business owner. I work with so many diverse people. I work with business owners, employees. \nSPEAKER_01:  public and the public private B2B B2C just a whole gambit of scenarios in addition to all my volunteer work so I'm very much required to just \nSPEAKER_01:  be patient and a great listener. \nSPEAKER_01:  In addition to the hard work that I've put in as evidence by my resume, I think the greatest problem or challenge that this redistricting commission is going to encounter besides, you know, navigating the political headwinds around just the politics around all the districts is just communication with the city citizens as a whole group dynamics, you know, forming, norming. And then the inevitable storming phase and the performing and then also getting access to the data in a timely fashion from the federal government that can also be a challenge as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm optimistic that my professionalism \nSPEAKER_01:  and my passion and concern for the City of Long Beach, the fact that I've \nSPEAKER_01:  I was born and raised to your left, King back. You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  gotten involved is I think is a powerful testimony to my dedication. \nSPEAKER_01:  and vision and understanding. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the district. I also think another challenge is just, you know, communicating and getting engagement from the cities, from the citizenship. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I think \nSPEAKER_01:  utilizing the approved methods of communication, the social media, the media and Long Beach posts and other outlets are great ways to facilitate transparency in the process, which is critical to get buy-in from the city to ensure that we have a smooth transition. \nSPEAKER_01:  If the borders of the districts are to change, thank you so much for your time. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does anyone have questions for Miss Scott? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any hands or any questions. So I think that concludes the interviews for District 7. Thank you so much to each of you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Like I said, I hope you all stay involved, regardless of what the outcome is of this selection process. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I think we're ready to move on to district eight. \nSPEAKER_09:  So District 8 is scheduled for 245, so we'll take a brief recess and come back around like 240. That's okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Perfect. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, Chair always, we have our voting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thank you very much. Welcome. We have now the candidates for district eight with us. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the procedure, as I think you each know, is \nSPEAKER_04:  that we will, there'll be an opportunity for you to make a \nSPEAKER_04:  a statement for five minutes answering the three questions that were submitted to you ahead of time. We then will \nSPEAKER_04:  have a chance for commissioners to ask questions if they have any. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll be making our final decisions probably next week. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I do want to say in advance that we really do appreciate your participation in this process. We found that we have a lot of great candidates in the city of Long Beach and we hope regardless of whether \nSPEAKER_04:  You're selected for this commission or not that you'll continue to contribute your expertise and \nSPEAKER_04:  Give to the City of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_04:  the city needs all of our help. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the city clerk, JTNAC, Yamma will be calling the interviewees as he has control over the technology. \nSPEAKER_04:  So JT. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Our first applicant is CD8-1, Michelle Anderson. If you can unmute yourself and you can begin. \nSPEAKER_02:  I am, my name is Michelle Anderson. I'm an attorney who's been practicing law for over 30 years. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that because of the nature of my practice, \nSPEAKER_02:  that I would be a good candidate for the Registration Commission because I've had to deal with many difficult issues, had to work with \nSPEAKER_02:  opposing council on numerous matters and also had to come to \nSPEAKER_02:  fair and reasonable dispositions based upon. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  evidence or factors and also had to consider. \nSPEAKER_02:  the individuals of \nSPEAKER_02:  the parties involved in numerous situations. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  in addition to that. \nSPEAKER_02:  I've had experience mediating. \nSPEAKER_02:  disputes among individuals. And so therefore, I think \nSPEAKER_02:  the nature of my practice also handling. \nSPEAKER_02:  Detailed matters. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  looking into. \nSPEAKER_02:  more than what has put before you. \nSPEAKER_02:  and to make sure \nSPEAKER_02:  that the right outcome is done. I have done matters such as real estate fraud. \nSPEAKER_02:  which involved \nSPEAKER_02:  I bring that up because it involves a lot of documents and tedious detail. And so you have to look into specifics and information. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  I've had many opportunities to collaborate with people on. \nSPEAKER_02:  different \nSPEAKER_02:  projects, but one of the projects that I worked on was an elections project. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  a couple of years ago for a panel discussion on all of the ballot measures. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I wanted to present the information. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  So that. \nSPEAKER_02:  the attendees. \nSPEAKER_02:  could make an informed decision. I wanted to make sure that information was provided accurately and not slanted towards one party or another. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so in collaborating with my other groups, we had to first choose who was going to be a panelist. \nSPEAKER_02:  and made sure that we equal that. You're about halfway. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about halfway. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  that. \nSPEAKER_02:  And also, so that worked out very well and gave people information of what \nSPEAKER_02:  a yes or no boat could mean and ask questions and make sure the panel is stayed on track. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that being able to work collaboratively with people is a very important component of being on redistricting commission. I think that the most \nSPEAKER_02:  probably difficult issue would be if we had a situation where \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  It looked like we were favoring one political party or one particular ethnic background and not reflecting. \nSPEAKER_02:  the census data has given to us. And so I would want to make sure that we were accurate in doing our duties and I would make sure that we followed the facts rather than \nSPEAKER_02:  political pressure or demographics. \nSPEAKER_02:  I know for an attorney that \nSPEAKER_02:  to be brief. \nSPEAKER_02:  is probably more difficult than to continue on and on, but I think the essence of working on an independent commission would be the ability to work well with others when there is a dispute to take back. \nSPEAKER_02:  Take a breath, look and see what we are and be fat, glib. \nSPEAKER_02:  and data led. \nSPEAKER_02:  and making decisions and drawing the maps accordingly. And that's my live conclude. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. Do any of the commissioners have questions for Ms. Anderson? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any. All right, then we will move on to the next candidate. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next candidate is CD8-9 Martha Duncan. If you can unmute yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  Hi, my name is Martha Duncan. I am a provider contracts manager with Malina Health Care. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  whose corporate headquarters are in downtown Long Beach. I've been a proud resident of District 8 for 17 years. \nSPEAKER_05:  I, as far as the \nSPEAKER_05:  Just addressing the questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would say that the specific qualities that I would bring to this position would be that I'm a very active listener able to listen without a preconceived answer in mind and also. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think I have a good ability to see all sides of a situation which helps to see the pros and cons of various scenarios. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  to describe a situation where I had to work collaboratively. \nSPEAKER_05:  collaboratively with others. \nSPEAKER_05:  The situation that came to mind is I am involved with a nonprofit in downtown Long Beach that serves the homeless population. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we recently had to deal with the resignation of our executive director. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that left us all the board and the volunteers trying to run the program in the interim while we're searching for a replacement. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the first week was mostly panicking about how we were going to get everything done. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now, someone in the group with an HR background suggested hiring a consultant. \nSPEAKER_05:  to help us take a look at our organization as a whole. \nSPEAKER_05:  and better define what we need in an executive director. \nSPEAKER_05:  So my role was one of four people on an executive committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we were able to work very collaboratively with a lot of Zoom meetings. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  And the lesson that I learned from that, that sometimes seeking outside help to look at your organization. \nSPEAKER_05:  in a very objective way can point out the street strengths and weaknesses that maybe you couldn't see. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I know that way will definitely be a stronger organization moving forward than if we tried to resolve the situation on our own. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  The other question is asking what the greatest problem that an independent Registration Commission could encounter. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  So redistricting for me is a completely foreign process. I really don't know anything about it and that might be a good thing or a bad thing. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I would obviously I would come to it with a completely blank. \nSPEAKER_05:  Slate. \nSPEAKER_05:  But one thing that I thought was that it might \nSPEAKER_08:  about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  that there might be \nSPEAKER_05:  someone that may try to interject their personal. \nSPEAKER_05:  or political preferences or prejudices into the process. \nSPEAKER_05:  Of course, that can happen in any situation, but in the case of redistricting that might happen, depending because I'm sure you have all kinds of personalities that come at the problems. \nSPEAKER_05:  with different perspectives. So I guess my response would be first not to attack the person personally, but try to get the group to make the person understand. \nSPEAKER_05:  that what they're doing is perhaps inappropriate. \nSPEAKER_05:  and maybe pointing out the behavior in an objective manner and trying to resolve the situation. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  kind of in conclusion. I just think that my experience is both \nSPEAKER_05:  work-wise and in activities that I'm involved in outside of work. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  give me a lot of both analytical skills and a lot of \nSPEAKER_05:  people skills, which I think that combination. \nSPEAKER_05:  would um \nSPEAKER_05:  B. \nSPEAKER_05:  a good combination enable in coming at the issue of redistricting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioners do you have any questions for? \nSPEAKER_04:  miss Duncan. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  see you nanny alright then this interview is concluded and we'll move to the next one please. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next applicant is CD8-20 Marissa Martinez. If you can, admit yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello, good afternoon, everyone on the Essex Commission. My name is Marissa Martinez, and I'm from the East District of Long Beach. I attended Jane Adams Elementary, Bank of Sacramento School in Lakewood, and Wilson High School across town. \nSPEAKER_06:  Early on, not only did I see the socioeconomic disparities of different areas of the city, but I also experienced it. A visual representation is the stark contrast from neighborhoods west and east of Cherry Avenue. \nSPEAKER_06:  And my resolve early on was to contribute to a more equitable environment for folks in low opportunity areas. \nSPEAKER_06:  I attended the University of California Irvine and this past June I earned a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and a Bachelor of Art in Urban Studies. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the specific qualities that I feel makes me good candidate for, to be part of the independent redistricting commission is that my academic background has provided me the insight on what resources low opportunity areas need. \nSPEAKER_06:  My urban studies background is very public works oriented. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I see the importance of civic engagement. I'm very detailed oriented and \nSPEAKER_06:  driven and that drive ties into being passionate about the history of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  as it relates to red lining. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the city and as stated by the kind that it's running for the eighth district. \nSPEAKER_06:  Long Beach does not exist in a vacuum. \nSPEAKER_06:  And there are \nSPEAKER_06:  incredibly powerful institutions in place that need to be reformed. \nSPEAKER_06:  in our country. And so that is one of the \nSPEAKER_06:  That makes the independent redistricting commission crucial. \nSPEAKER_06:  In addition to that, my technical experience ranges from computer-aided design AutoCAD. \nSPEAKER_06:  SketchUp, RGIS mapping, which is data. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Also to continue on to answering the second question. As a still engineering major, it's all about collaboration and communication. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I was the project manager of my senior design project, which is essentially our capstone project. I learned a team of six civil engineering seniors and we designed a hypothetical pedestrian bridge. \nSPEAKER_06:  for a professional engineering firm in Santa Ana, called Michael Baker International. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_06:  your butt halfway through. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you. My role as project manager was to ensure that everyone in the team was updated on the task delegated to them. \nSPEAKER_06:  And because we were all graduating seniors, many folks on the team carried responsibilities inside of school. So a reoccurring challenge was ensuring that members personal time was respected because we would travel out of the university campus to meet with our client consultants at their firm. \nSPEAKER_06:  And one of the lessons that I take from this group experience \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  would be empathy and the reminders that we all have our own perspectives and backgrounds. So naturally we will have different strategies, but the agreement is an integral part of coming up with something better. \nSPEAKER_06:  especially because we are all working towards our shared goal. \nSPEAKER_06:  And one of the greatest problems the Independent Redistricting Commission could encounter. \nSPEAKER_06:  would be \nSPEAKER_06:  the political pressure to keep the map. \nSPEAKER_06:  boundaries similar to what it is right now. \nSPEAKER_06:  I worked for the U.S. Census Bureau these past couple of months. \nSPEAKER_06:  as an enumerator, knocking door to door in heavily populated areas of Long Beach and our surrounding cities. So my first time experience with my privilege of being bilingual in Spanish was that many folks that immigrated here several decades ago did not participate in the census up until this year. And so civic engagement is especially difficult when people do not see the benefits of policy and that \nSPEAKER_06:  Political at the feet is symptomatic of past. \nSPEAKER_06:  patterns of chairmentary and so \nSPEAKER_06:  as stated previously, folks, there will be a lot of interjection of personal benefits or personal goals or what we think is right, but \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we will, we will as a commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  as a commission member. \nSPEAKER_06:  The best way to respond to that problem is to \nSPEAKER_06:  be transparent. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's yeah, that's it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Do any of the commissioners have questions for Miss Martinez? \nSPEAKER_04:  I have not seen any hands up or any questions. So thank you very much and we'll move to the next interview. Thank you for your attention. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next applicant is CD8-25 Melody Osunah. If you can unmute yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_03:  Good afternoon. I'm my name is Melody Osunna. So the qualities that I can bring as a good member of the Commission would be first enthusiasm. I am so excited to be considered a part of making a change in my community. Second, it would be an analytical skills as an attorney. I can read, understand and comply with the laws that the Commission will need and be required to follow. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the third familiarity with the neighborhoods of the city not only as resident and homeowner, but also as a lead attorney who's worked among each from a years. You know, I previously worked with homeless veterans at the VA and down at the Cabrio, and I currently provide free legal services to patients at a medical facility in district in council district one. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  in regards to a goal working towards a common goal, basically the team or question. Right now I'm currently a chair of the race equity committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  from my job. And so what we are doing is we are trying to analyze data from previous previous clients in order to see where the holes are in our services for the BIPOC. \nSPEAKER_03:  BIPOC community. And so that involves a lot of data polling, cleaning, analyzing, and changes. \nSPEAKER_03:  figuring out from data from different areas of Los Angeles County in addition to data in regards to an analyzing data in regards to \nSPEAKER_03:  race, gender, and different demographics. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so as a part of that, our biggest conflict is \nSPEAKER_03:  time. Most of us don't have the extra time in order to do this on top of our daily deliverables. And so bringing a group together from different areas of our organization and working towards this common goal can be difficult because of the time conflicts. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so what we have done is basically, we took a step back from our current plan and realized it had kind of ballooned up against us a little bit and we set up a plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  So what we are doing is we're reaching out to our board members and we're going to have a couple asks of them. One, either to have funding for an outside researcher to help us analyze this data or two, to ask for specialty software that we can use to kind of alleviate the time issues that's happening for our commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  And so the lessons that I take from that is sometimes when it feels like you're going against a big conflict or a big issue, you just. You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Take a minute. \nSPEAKER_03:  brainstorm and then set up a plan to get out of it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Because you can't just keep spinning your wheels if you're going to not have a plan to get out of it. \nSPEAKER_03:  And finally, the greatest problem that I see in regards to the commission is meeting the requirements to set up the districts without disenfranchising the communities. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, measure triple G was set up to give the people the vote and that's what we need to make sure that we are honoring while following the laws that are in place for redistricting. And so in order to do that we are going to be having to work hard, play, pay close attention to the census data and the laws, specifically the Boney Rights Act, follow it and do our community justice. \nSPEAKER_03:  And in order to do that, we need to meet transparent and make sure that we the committee knows what we are doing and that we are doing justice for them. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much, commissioners. Do you have any questions from Ms. Asuna? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any, so thank you very much for your participation today and hopefully going forward with other things in the city as well. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next applicant is CD8-29, Gailia Richmond. \nSPEAKER_09:  Can you unmute yourself and you can be yet? \nSPEAKER_10:  Good afternoon, my name is Gabi, I'm a psychiatric social worker for in Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. \nSPEAKER_10:  I serve on the school Dread Assessment and Response Team, also known as Start. I work with students. \nSPEAKER_10:  K through 12 and also college students who make threats of targeted school violence. In that role, I do a lot of collaboration with schools, families, police department, and our healthcare system. And sometimes I place kids on psychiatric holds to ensure that they don't carry out those threats or also if they have suicidal ideation. \nSPEAKER_10:  as a social worker and my profession, I have ran different nonprofits, ultimate health services, El Nido family centers primarily working with pregnant and parenting teens. \nSPEAKER_10:  I've been a resident of Long Beach for 12 years. I've been in District 8 for the last two years and previously lived on the east side of Long Beach for about seven years. So I've seen \nSPEAKER_10:  Um, just a different parts of Long Beach and I really feel like redistricting. \nSPEAKER_10:  and doing something and being part of this to be equitable for all of Long Beach. I feel like that is super important. \nSPEAKER_10:  as a social worker, I have. \nSPEAKER_10:  that expertise and lens of meeting people where they are serving people from diverse backgrounds. \nSPEAKER_10:  including social economic backgrounds, religion, cultural race, \nSPEAKER_10:  You name it. So I'm a social worker, so I see people. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  most times at their absolute worst. People don't see social workers because everything is going right. So with that being said, I'm always mindful of that, mindful of the power that I have coming in and really do a great job of listening to the family, the school system, \nSPEAKER_10:  law enforcement hospital hospital systems to make sure that that hurts. \nSPEAKER_10:  is necessarily getting exactly what they need and I feel like those skills. \nSPEAKER_10:  will transfer and in this redistricting and allow me to really \nSPEAKER_10:  see everything be fair and honest and not judge people and really bring forth that social work lens to help create a map that is fair and equitable to all of Long Beach so that Long Beach can see be seen as one big group and not seen as the good part of Long Beach or the bad part of Long Beach. We want to keep this whole and keep it great. \nSPEAKER_10:  The biggest barrier that I see is not staying fair and true to what our goal is. I know sometimes it's easy to get off track by things that happen. You're about halfway. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're about to have a good time. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  collaboration and working as a team. \nSPEAKER_10:  is super important. \nSPEAKER_10:  And I look forward to being on this redistricting to consider bringing forth my skills as a social worker as a resident of Long Beach. As a parent that has a school a four year old in the public school system. I feel like all of that knowledge and information will be helpful to this commission. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Are there any questions from this Richmond? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any, so I think that concludes the interviews for District 8. Thank you very much to each of you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure.

I can read them to you if you wish. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, though. \nSPEAKER_04:  Would you like me to read them? \nSPEAKER_12:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  One is what specific qualities do you have that you feel will make you a good independent redistricting commission member. \nSPEAKER_04:  two, if you're selected. \nSPEAKER_04:  You will be one of 13 members and two alternates of the commission, which is charged with working together to create maps of the new districts. \nSPEAKER_04:  subscribe a situation where you had to work collaboratively with others on a project to achieve a common goal. \nSPEAKER_04:  tell us the goal of the project which a role in the group was and how the group worked through any conflicts that arose. \nSPEAKER_04:  and what lessons would you take from this group experience to the commission of selected? \nSPEAKER_04:  The last question is what's the greatest problem? The independent redistricting commission could encounter. And what actions would you take to avoid or respond to this problem? \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_12:  Sir, I'll leave. \nSPEAKER_12:  So on the specific qualities that I have, \nSPEAKER_12:  that will make me a... \nSPEAKER_12:  but independent redistricting commissioner. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm from a different state. I'm from Minneapolis, I grew up in Minneapolis. \nSPEAKER_12:  And I just with this the turnaround of like just how everything. \nSPEAKER_12:  with as far as the community goes, like, you know, we have so many activities. \nSPEAKER_12:  in the community and in um \nSPEAKER_12:  Everything turned around from there when we know things were cut. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_12:  \ub2e4\ud589\ud788 1945\ub144 6\uc6d4 20\uc77c \nSPEAKER_12:  You know, the crime rate went up and \nSPEAKER_12:  That's what kind of pushed me to go into the field of social services. \nSPEAKER_12:  I have \nSPEAKER_12:  a bachelor's degree in social services. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um. \nSPEAKER_12:  and main emphasis in mental health and juicing. \nSPEAKER_12:  Doing a lot of field work, I noticed that like. \nSPEAKER_12:  if the community was more involved. \nSPEAKER_12:  with \nSPEAKER_12:  that use are more involved with \nSPEAKER_12:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  If the community was more involved with \nSPEAKER_12:  Oh \nSPEAKER_12:  A lot of activities go free activities free of \nSPEAKER_12:  you know, just getting sponsorship from people. \nSPEAKER_12:  It would I feel like it would everything would go smooth. \nSPEAKER_12:  And so, um, \nSPEAKER_12:  I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but yeah, life. \nSPEAKER_12:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_12:  I have just, you know, I have \nSPEAKER_12:  family that's involved in the community as well. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_12:  They have been an example to me as far as like \nSPEAKER_12:  you know, taking action and um \nSPEAKER_12:  You know, not just sitting around and like talking about things, but actually getting up and doing something about \nSPEAKER_12:  the things that are going on in the community. \nSPEAKER_12:  And so \nSPEAKER_12:  I just I've always had a passion through third the community. \nSPEAKER_12:  I also lived in Oakland. \nSPEAKER_12:  where me and a friend we collaborated together to put on \nSPEAKER_12:  activities in the community. \nSPEAKER_12:  And it was very successful. We passed our food to the homeless. \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  We got artists involved in what we did like \nSPEAKER_12:  Um \nSPEAKER_12:  you know as far as people who wanted to wrap our scene, we got the youth involved and \nSPEAKER_12:  I just kind of feel like, you know, anything you have to do with the community, I'm just \nSPEAKER_12:  ready to do it and I've been a resident of Long Beach.

So that means we can move now to item number two. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is we're going to have a report from \nSPEAKER_02:  staff about the application and interview process and \nSPEAKER_02:  to consider some options to correct administrative error which resulted in \nSPEAKER_02:  the issuance of some \nSPEAKER_02:  invitations to interview which \nSPEAKER_02:  were not intended to be issued. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  who's going to make the presentation to the mission. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll be presenting to you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  saturating carry away. Definitely going to do that for another \ubc84\uc804ie Inside. We will not waste my money going to Nobody. freaked out. Parte off. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry, bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Sorry, Dr. Newton-Commissioners, JT is going to be presenting the report. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Becky. So following the interviews on Wednesday afternoon, it was brought to our attention by Commissioner Shotwell that there was a discrepancy between the applications of the applicants who originally selected to the sub-poll by the ad hoc committees and the applications of the applicants who are interviewed. Upon further review, we discovered an error in the transcription of some of the application numbers that were associated with applicants selected to be interviewed that affected Council's districts 3, 4, 6, and 9. Due to this transcription error, a total of 11 applications not originally selected by the ad hoc committees were moved forward to the interview process and the ones selected were not. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yesterday morning we notified chairwise and vice chair morale is and decided to hold off on interviewing the remaining candidates who were not originally selected to be interviewed until a discussion by the full commission was able to take place in an open session. Due to Brown Act noticing requirements, the soonest we could discuss this item in an open session was at today's meeting. There were three applicants who had interviewed prior to the discovery of the air and the remaining four applicants scheduled to be interviewed were notified that their application and interview status were pending. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now I'll go over a breakdown by Council District of the number of applicants affected. So for Council District 3, the correct number of interviews and notifications were four of the five. And there was one incorrect number of interviews and notifications. The applicant who was added in air moved and was removed from consideration because they moved out of the district. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  For Council District 4, the correct number of interviews and notifications was one out of the five There was four incorrect number of interviews and notifications for this district and Three of the four non-selected applicants interviewed and one did not show up to the meeting \nSPEAKER_00:  For Council District 6, the correct number of interviews and notifications was three of the five. One of the three withdrew from the process and the incorrect number of interview and notifications was two. One of the two non-selectant applicants were notified that their status of their application interview is pending. This decision made by the commission at today's meeting and the second applicant was removed from consideration due to ineligibility due to the per the city charter. \nSPEAKER_09:  of Barr,, \nSPEAKER_00:  or count so district. \nSPEAKER_09:  KT I just... \nSPEAKER_09:  I went back and looked at District 6 and I didn't find an error. \nSPEAKER_00:  or Council District 6, the... \nSPEAKER_00:  Application numbers in error was CD6-26 and CD6-34. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, so CD6-26 isn't on the spreadsheet you have sent. \nSPEAKER_09:  out. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's supposed to be CD, 624 and CD. \nSPEAKER_06:  634. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Right. Okay. So the spreadsheet that you sent out was correct, but the invitations were incorrect. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  So it was the correct numbers, but when we transposed the numbers that were associated with the names, it was off by one number. So we ended up affixing the CD6-24 and CD6-34 to those applications with the names and all the other information were dictated and that's where the arrow was. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  it was a good one. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. And then for. Thank you. Appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then for Council District 9, the correct number of interviews and notifications was one of the five. And for the four incorrect interviews and notifications, three of the four non-selected applicants were notified that the status of their application and interview is pending with the decision to be made by the commission at today's meeting and the fourth applicant withdrew from the process. \nSPEAKER_00:  So in summary, a total of 11 selected applicants were not invited to be interviewed. Three of the non-selected applicants were interviewed on Wednesday, October 7th. Four non-selected applicants were notified they will be updated on their status following this meeting. And four, and four of the applicants have been removed from consideration. So the options moving forward to correct this error. There are two options. The first option, the commission can move forward with the current pool consisting of the 11 applicants who are originally selected to be interviewed. We'll be reaching out to them after this meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  to pay on your decision. And then that'll be along with the seven non-selected applicants who are included in the interview, Polen Air. \nSPEAKER_00:  This would result in a total of 48 applicants within the numbers established by the city charter. And it would include seven net additional candidates taking into consideration dropouts and no shows. \nSPEAKER_00:  The other option is the option two would be the commission can choose to invite the 11 applicants who are originally selected to be interviewed and request staff to remove the applicants Who are not selected by the ad hoc committees to be interviewed including the three applicants who are who have already been interviewed This would result in total of 41 applicants taking to account the dropouts and no-shows and We really sincerely apologize for this unintentional error and are ready to help correct it according to your direction \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, so let's have some comments, questions, discussion. \nSPEAKER_09:  So in JT, your email from yesterday, you highlighted certain applicants. \nSPEAKER_09:  who were not scheduled to be interviewed even though they were selected by the ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so the interview I sent yesterday noted the applicants who were sent invitations in error. And then it was noting the ones who had been notified the one yesterday and three today who were notified that \nSPEAKER_00:  They would, their application and interview status was on hold pending the outcome of today's decision. And then the three applicants, I believe, who were interviewed in error. But I have to double check it, give me one second. \nSPEAKER_09:  Right. \nSPEAKER_09:  So the highlighted folks. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  were selected by the ad hoc committee but not interviewed. \nSPEAKER_09:  I would like to interview them. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the selected, so on that one, so the ones in red were the ones that went through. The three that are in black CD4-13, 4-15, 4-28 were the three that were interviewed in air. And then the four that are highlighted were the ones that were invited. So all of these were invited in air, but the four that are highlighted were notified that their status is pending. So there's a total of 11 applicants we didn't invite into the process that we would reach out to following this meeting to interview at another time. So the first option would include the 11 applicants that were originally selected by the ad hoc committees, and then also include the three who were already interviewed. And then we would interview the additional four that were... \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  were notified in air. And then the second option would be we would reach out to the 11 who were selected by the ad hoc committees and not notified. And then we would let these, the three who were already interviewed and the four additional ones know that they were being removed from consideration. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hey, JT just I want to be absolutely clear I understand so the list you sent out yesterday at 222 \nSPEAKER_03:  PM. \nSPEAKER_03:  Those are the eleven who were interviewed. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh... i'm sorry those were the original the written ones that were scheduled for interview \nSPEAKER_00:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Some of them we interviewed some didn't. \nSPEAKER_00:  Add so that, we're coming back here with for a second. Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then there's 11 names that we don't have here. \nSPEAKER_03:  that we're not scheduled to interview. \nSPEAKER_03:  but we're selected by the subcommittees therefore. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think part of your proposal is that we would reach out to them and interview them. You knew I love it. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Sawasbook \nSPEAKER_05:  So if I could jump in real quick. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, staff called chair White and I yesterday and we had a conversation. \nSPEAKER_05:  We chair, why, and I thought it would be best if because there was no way to get those 11. \nSPEAKER_05:  scheduled in today. It was just two short notice. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we thought it would be best that we not go forward with interviews from anyone who was not selected by their ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  yesterday or today to try and mitigate some of the damage until we as a group could make a decision. \nSPEAKER_05:  on where we want to go. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think we're probably all going to agree that it would be best if we go forward with those 11. \nSPEAKER_05:  who were chosen by the ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  Get them scheduled in for an interview. \nSPEAKER_05:  Hopefully, I mean, \nSPEAKER_05:  There's a possibility that they could be scheduled in next Wednesday to our regular meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then we'll have to work on other schedules. \nSPEAKER_05:  but then \nSPEAKER_05:  I think the bigger question for us is what do we do? \nSPEAKER_05:  with those who were inadvertently scheduled and interviewed. We've got \nSPEAKER_05:  A few people. \nSPEAKER_05:  who were contacted, who we did interview. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then we've got some who were contacted who had not been interviewed. \nSPEAKER_05:  So do we want to consider the, I think what the staff is trying to ask us. \nSPEAKER_05:  is do we want to go forward and interview all of those people who were inadvertently contacted? \nSPEAKER_05:  because they were contacted. \nSPEAKER_05:  and given \nSPEAKER_05:  the impression that they were going forward in the process. \nSPEAKER_05:  or do we want to explain to them that there was an air we're sorry and not go forward and interview them any further. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  My concern, which I raised in the meeting yesterday and which I have a couple additional concerns was one is that I think. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's important for us to stick with the process that we \nSPEAKER_02:  adapted. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  And if there was a mistake made, then we just tell them and apologize and thank them for their \nSPEAKER_02:  They're interested and \nSPEAKER_02:  and go on. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm also. \nSPEAKER_02:  concerned. \nSPEAKER_02:  as I think about it more and after seeing the \nSPEAKER_02:  as the names started to come out. \nSPEAKER_02:  that um \nSPEAKER_02:  that we \nSPEAKER_02:  We did that selection process with the anonymity of the candidates. I mean, the ad hoc committees did not know who the candidates were. \nSPEAKER_02:  Now we've got the opportunity to interview some of them. We know who they are. \nSPEAKER_02:  but they weren't supposed to be. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  weren't supposed to be interviewed. And I'm afraid that that \nSPEAKER_02:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_02:  that anonymity and that whole process has been lost. \nSPEAKER_02:  The third point which was raised by Commissioner Morales when we talked yesterday was that it changes the numbers. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the randomness of the process because \nSPEAKER_02:  There are \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, in some districts, there would be a lot of candidates. And so quote unquote, your chance of getting your name drawn out of the hat when we, when we finally do that would be, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  It could be, it could be. \nSPEAKER_02:  reduced. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  So for all those reasons, I just say that right now, and I'm very interested to hear what the rest of you. \nSPEAKER_02:  You have to say that my inclination is that we apologize to those who were the \nSPEAKER_02:  subject to the mistake and and proceed with the process that we \nSPEAKER_02:  We \nSPEAKER_02:  I know this was intentional and it's probably \nSPEAKER_02:  Not bad. \nSPEAKER_02:  on. \nSPEAKER_02:  and along with it may not be that big a deal, but I think this is a very serious process in that the \nSPEAKER_02:  the decisions that are made here. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, are going to have \nSPEAKER_02:  in terms of \nSPEAKER_02:  of the work of the redistricting commission. Those decisions are going to have big influence on law and beach going forward. \nSPEAKER_09:  I just I feel like I still need clarification because we have 11 names listed \nSPEAKER_09:  in the email. \nSPEAKER_09:  from KK yesterday. \nSPEAKER_09:  Some of those folks were selected by the subcommittee and some of them weren't. \nSPEAKER_00:  So for the 11 names that I sent to you yesterday, those ones were the ones who were included in the interviews in error. And there's an additional 11 for a list of 11 names that I have that should have been included. \nSPEAKER_09:  I actually listened to the tape recording on CD6 and CD6-24 and CD6-34 were \nSPEAKER_09:  selected by the ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's why I'm confused. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so the applications that you, so the numbers are correct, but the applications that you received in the packet were wrong. So from the original packet, we reredacted the applications again and issued them the number. So the numbers that were all included in the interview poll were correct, but the names and the applications were wrong. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So let me just explain because I did. \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean, I know I don't know what you're talking about, but if you take if you take the package that \nSPEAKER_02:  that you received for all the people in CD-20, in CD-6. \nSPEAKER_02:  And you look at the resume that was marked CD24. It is not the resume that we receive. \nSPEAKER_02:  as one of the five when \nSPEAKER_02:  for interview. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's the problem. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Got it. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, because that's why we were dealing with numbers, not names to your point. Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so when we associate the names with the numbers, the names are off. And then we had to re-redact them to leave the names. And when we added \nSPEAKER_00:  When we associate the names and the numbers, they were off a little bit. For those districts. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is a piece ofq shoes from Lowe. Any other kinds of shoes Where \nSPEAKER_03:  if I may. So I \nSPEAKER_03:  I appreciate the two options and I struggle with this. There was actually... \nSPEAKER_03:  at least one, maybe just one of the candidates. \nSPEAKER_03:  that \nSPEAKER_03:  We interviewed. \nSPEAKER_03:  on. \nSPEAKER_03:  Monday or Wednesday that \nSPEAKER_03:  I actually \nSPEAKER_03:  think i like a lot uh... compared to \nSPEAKER_03:  uh... the other candidate that uh... i think would have been interviewed \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Having said that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think we established a process. \nSPEAKER_03:  We... \nSPEAKER_03:  Follow that process. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have lost in some of these. We've lost a little bit of the anonymity that we had to begin with because these individuals \nSPEAKER_03:  we know them in terms of the \nSPEAKER_03:  in terms of the \nSPEAKER_03:  having interviewed them the ones that we weren't supposed to interview. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we reduce that randomness of the process, which I think is very important. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  I tend to lean towards the option that we go with the candidates that we originally scheduled to interview. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can't do agree with you, chairweiss. \nSPEAKER_10:  And is there other commissioners? \nSPEAKER_10:  I have comments or questions or \nSPEAKER_10:  Wanna weigh in on this? \nSPEAKER_01:  I have just one quick question. \nSPEAKER_01:  JTV11. \nSPEAKER_01:  that were selected but not interviewed. We have not reached out to them to confirm their availability, correct? \nSPEAKER_00:  No, so that's something we'll also have to discuss today is pending your decision on which way you want to go, and then just to see when you would want to interview them, and then \nSPEAKER_00:  the schedule. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right. OK, so my next question is I was trying to follow along. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that \nSPEAKER_01:  Across the nine districts, we had some people either ruled ineligible or people who withdrew from consideration. And those people may have been originally selected by the ad hoc committee or they may have been inadvertently at contacted for interviews. And then we subsequently learned that they were either no longer eligible. \nSPEAKER_01:  or withdrawing. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  if we contact the... \nSPEAKER_01:  11 people we meant to contact. Are we still going to ensure that we interview five candidates from each district? That would be my only other concern echoing chair Weiss' recommendation that we stick with our original 11. I just want to clarify to the extent I'm not following if we install those 11 back into the process. Are we going to have? \nSPEAKER_01:  five from each district IEC. Chair Morales is shaking. \nSPEAKER_01:  Movin's \nSPEAKER_05:  And I'll use CD3 as an example we had. \nSPEAKER_05:  one two candidates that were disqualified and since none of our ad hoc committees selected alternatives. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's no way to plug in additional candidates for those council districts. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it will still... \nSPEAKER_00:  So yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Some council districts that will have less than the five. \nSPEAKER_05:  but for those council districts where some were inadvertently called. \nSPEAKER_05:  if we bring those in at Burton. \nSPEAKER_05:  candidates into the process, they will have greater than the five. \nSPEAKER_01:  I see. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I guess to finish, my thought would be then that I agree that I would just echo the inclination to stick with our original 11 that we, that the various ad hoc committees selected. But if it is at all possible, I know this would be a little more cumbersome. You know, we're concerned about the anonymity that was involved in the process and things like that. I would want to at least discuss the possibility of the ad hoc committees recondening to the extent necessary to pick however many other candidates might be needed to ensure that. I would like to ensure that five candidates are our interview once we discard the ones that were mistakenly contacted. Does that make sense? \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just think that way would ensure that we get five people that we meant to select originally as part of the intended process so that each district is presented or were presented with five candidates from each district before we narrow it down any further. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so to answer your question or to. \nSPEAKER_00:  to chime in on that, um, commissioner Feedler. So if we went with the option to, um, remove the incorrect interviewees, um, we would end up potentially if all 11, um, we're in every year, we would end up with four in CD one, five in CD two, four in CD three, five in CD four, um, five in CD five, four in CD four, and CD seven, and then five in each eight and nine. Um, so, and that's if all of them confirm and none of them, um, withdraw and are able to attend the meeting. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right, which is still to be determined to understand. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're going to have four or five in each district. Is that what you just said, JT? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, if all 11 confirm and are interviewed, it would be four or five in each district and then it would be a total of 41 interviews. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm mean. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will say, Sydney and retrospect, I do wish that \nSPEAKER_02:  Each subcommittee had \nSPEAKER_02:  chosen alternatives. That was something we didn't consider doing so we haven't done it. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's you at the timing, how much cushion there is and the timing on this. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  maybe staff would help us with that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yet so the sub pull has to be established and the first nine redistricting commissions has to be randomly selected by November 1st. And then we have to onboard those first nine commissioners and then they have to decide on the last four commissioners and two alternates by December 1st. \nSPEAKER_02:  For better for worse, I'll just say that we decided that we would do the subcommittees as in a public process, which means that we notice the meetings. \nSPEAKER_02:  And in theory, people are able to watch them. And they're recorded if anyone cares to listen. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think we all know that we don't think we're getting, we have a lot of, we have a big audience out there. \nSPEAKER_02:  but um \nSPEAKER_02:  for the purpose of history, I think, and consistency. Like I said, I think this is important, important process. \nSPEAKER_02:  They're probably, it says to me like it probably is enough time. \nSPEAKER_02:  to what's today today is the \nSPEAKER_02:  9 \nSPEAKER_02:  There probably is enough time to reconvene the subcommittees and have them. \nSPEAKER_02:  pick an alternate or two. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  if we \nSPEAKER_02:  if we want to use our time in that regard. \nSPEAKER_02:  but we probably then looking at. \nSPEAKER_02:  two or three meetings of this group between now and \nSPEAKER_02:  and howling. \nSPEAKER_03:  Chair White. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm putting aside the time commitment and I'm comfortable with what we would have to do. \nSPEAKER_03:  I definitely appreciate Commissioner Fielders. \nSPEAKER_03:  feedlers concerned. \nSPEAKER_03:  But so on one hand. \nSPEAKER_03:  We had the process that was announced on the other hand. \nSPEAKER_03:  It didn't fall away. \nSPEAKER_03:  work out to where we had all intended. \nSPEAKER_03:  So it's a longer way of me asking a question. \nSPEAKER_03:  If maybe council can weigh in. \nSPEAKER_03:  in terms of \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, the appropriateness of... \nSPEAKER_03:  do. \nSPEAKER_03:  should we be sticking to the initial process that we established or \nSPEAKER_03:  Do we go with the intent of the process that we initially established? \nSPEAKER_03:  even though we did it. \nSPEAKER_03:  select the ultimate. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner say five minutes chime in. I think the original thought when we went through the process of selecting a sub pull of 45 \nSPEAKER_06:  was I believe with an understanding that perhaps not everybody was going to be able to participate that we may, you know, we were probably going to have some that withdrew. \nSPEAKER_06:  either you know there \nSPEAKER_06:  life changed and they couldn't make the commitment or for one reason or another not all five from each district. \nSPEAKER_06:  We're going to be. \nSPEAKER_06:  making it to the end of the process. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think by selecting 45 that would give the commission \nSPEAKER_06:  enough candidates to then get the 2230 subpoil. \nSPEAKER_06:  from where the chair will be making a selection of one member from each council district. I don't think the intent. \nSPEAKER_06:  was that all 45 were going to make it through to the end. I think it was just to give the commission a cushion. \nSPEAKER_06:  to then get the 20 to 30 candidates that were needed for that second sub pool. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Nah. \nSPEAKER_01:  I follow that and that makes sense as long as that's consistent with \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, the original kind of intent of the process as it was established. I'm fine with proceeding with less than five applicants from each district. You know, again, my only concern is that we, chairwise, echoed or voiced a concern about, for example, the names that also ultimately make it in the hat. One candidate's chances might be increased or decreased based on the number of people from respective districts in the hat. And so if we are narrowing our sub-pool down from from from respective groups that are that are not uniform, then those applicants are having a what could be perceived to be an unfair weighted chance to make it into that sub-pool. I know that wasn't the most statistically clear way of articulating that. But \nSPEAKER_01:  to the extent that presents some view of unfairness for, say, one district with five applicants from which we select one or two to another district where maybe only three were presented and we select one or two. \nSPEAKER_01:  As long as there's no concern there based on the original intent of the process as it was set forth in the charter, then. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm fine proceeding with that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Cheers! \nSPEAKER_02:  Did council have a comment? \nSPEAKER_04:  I chair the wife and members of the commission. This is Amy Weber from the City Attorney's Office. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just wanted to chime in if you can hear me. I hope you can. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  that the charter doesn't require mathematical precision. What it does instead is to give us some fairly broad outlines. And I think at the time that this process was envisioned, \nSPEAKER_04:  That was what was intended was to \nSPEAKER_04:  devise a process. \nSPEAKER_04:  with enough leeway to get us the number of candidates we need for the commission or all being as fair as we possibly can. \nSPEAKER_04:  in an imperfect world with \nSPEAKER_04:  to each individual council district. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I believe that to go forward as chairwice had proposed. \nSPEAKER_04:  originally with the 11 candidates who were erroneously excluded would allow you to be in compliance with the charter and in compliance with the original intent of the process. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for that explanation. And this is JT. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, and this is Jay Tate's. Oh, sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then I just want to point out that the charter also says that there shouldn't be any quotient or ratio used in the for the sub pool decision outside of the minimum of two per council district. \nSPEAKER_04:  So you are certainly well within your cushion. \nSPEAKER_04:  looking at that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Got it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I just wanted to be clear that, um, \nSPEAKER_03:  I need to crack myself that, you know, I didn't mean to say that, I said that the end \nSPEAKER_03:  of the original antenna of the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  the original content of the work and the subcommittees. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's where I really wanted that clarification of what was that original intent. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't want my comments to be interpreted that I thought that was the original intent. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was looking for clarification of what our ritual intent was. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does anyone else have any questions or comments? \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, Mr. Independence. \nSPEAKER_07:  And not to be difficult, but I do agree with Commissioner Feudler. It was my hope. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I think that \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll say at our subcommittee level was to deliver five. And I wanted to have five delivered. I like the suggestion that if we are below five. If there is the time, yeah, I don't think it is. \nSPEAKER_07:  Based on what JT had shared, there may be only one or two, maybe three that would be not achieving that number of five. If it isn't too much of a trouble. Since it is the \nSPEAKER_07:  the errors on our side, I think that to deliver if those subcommittees can get together and get that back up. \nSPEAKER_07:  deliver that five and go with the intended 45 that would be my preference, but I will work with commission on \nSPEAKER_07:  on what is decided. \nSPEAKER_02:  I \nSPEAKER_02:  I've thought of another problem with that at the same time that I like the overall idea I have to say. \nSPEAKER_02:  But that is that with \nSPEAKER_02:  reference to a commission to district four. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's impossible for that subcommittee now to consider the applications anonymously because they have now met. \nSPEAKER_02:  in person. \nSPEAKER_02:  several of the people that they can select when they look at them anonymously. \nSPEAKER_02:  So, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  That. \nSPEAKER_02:  there is. Yeah, there is. \nSPEAKER_07:  They're in this, yeah, they're in this to conundrum. \nSPEAKER_02:  We can't unring the bell. \nSPEAKER_07:  right and that was one of ours that I know that we worked very hard on so. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Now. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  while we need it at \nSPEAKER_02:  Does anyone else have any comments being? \nSPEAKER_02:  that they want to make because otherwise I think we're ready to have a motion in some in some format as to how we're going to direct staff to proceed in light of this air that's been discovered regarding the extension of invitations for interviews. \nSPEAKER_05:  I was going to see if Commissioner Manikis wanted to say anything. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm going to read that. \nSPEAKER_08:  11 should be the 11 that were not included should be notified and invited. \nSPEAKER_08:  lahem \nSPEAKER_08:  I would like to know actually after \nSPEAKER_08:  We received their. \nSPEAKER_08:  RSVP is where we land from the mountains, to the numbers. \nSPEAKER_00:  easy. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, \nSPEAKER_08:  and do feel that the cushion that we've had with the 45, it feels okay now for five, but once we start getting down to like three, that... \nSPEAKER_08:  it kind of changes things for me. So \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm comfortable with proceeding with notification today. I love you. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then also declining and admitting and apologizing to the 11 that were inadvertently. \nSPEAKER_08:  invited, but would like to know what the result is after we extend the rotation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Since everyone's spoken, I'll go ahead and make a motion that we move forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  with calling those candidates that were inadvertently omitted from the process. \nSPEAKER_05:  in for interviews. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that letter be sent to those that were inadvertently \nSPEAKER_05:  and included in the process advising them that \nSPEAKER_05:  they will not be going forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  and maybe staff, I'd staffed bright that letter for you to sign chairwise. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, we can contact them. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have a motion to notify the 11 that were \nSPEAKER_02:  not included and \nSPEAKER_02:  arranged for their interviews and to advise the 11 who were invited erroneously that were \nSPEAKER_02:  that we \nSPEAKER_02:  did not intend to invite them and we are grateful for their time and apologize for the for the air. \nSPEAKER_02:  Do we have a second to that? \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll second it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want to point out that it does not include the comments. \nSPEAKER_02:  that Commissioner Manakee just made about waiting to see what the \nSPEAKER_02:  the numbers are... \nSPEAKER_02:  And I don't know if... \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll just have us. \nSPEAKER_02:  go forward. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hopefully next I think in reality what this means is that \nSPEAKER_02:  next Wednesday we would do those additional interviews and then we need and if that's so then we also need to have a discussion about it on that very same day. \nSPEAKER_02:  want to evaluate everyone or have a second meeting to evaluate them. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  If we get that report that \nSPEAKER_02:  that it turns out that we have several districts with only three people now that are available. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  But are we? \nSPEAKER_02:  I guess first thing is, I don't know that we want to let the 11 know that they're out of it yet. \nSPEAKER_02:  If we're going to decide that we then want to be convened the subcommittees after Wednesday. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just pointing out those. \nSPEAKER_02:  practicalities and \nSPEAKER_02:  in love. \nSPEAKER_02:  in a way where we are. \nSPEAKER_06:  chair and commission just chiming in. I don't know that after. I mean, first of all, we're going to be sending out the letters. \nSPEAKER_06:  to the 11 selected applicants that were not originally invited. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we have to make sure that they're available to interview on Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  And I don't know, timing wise, I know JT correct me if I'm wrong. You said that a selection has to be made up the ninth. \nSPEAKER_06:  commissioners for the IRC by November 1st. \nSPEAKER_06:  So next week is already mid October. \nSPEAKER_06:  So realistically, then convening at HOP committees after that. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't know that we're going to be able to make that deadline. So just want to keep that perspective. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  out there so that you take it to consideration the timing. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think we go forward with an optimistic view that we're going to. \nSPEAKER_05:  After we do the interviews of the 11 that were omitted. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll have at least four or five in each of the districts. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I think if we go forward that optimistic process, \nSPEAKER_05:  Then I think after we take this vote, Chair Weiss, and maybe we could have a discussion about \nSPEAKER_05:  whether we want to go right into the decision next Wednesday or if we want to schedule a separate meeting for that. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  All right. \nSPEAKER_09:  I did have a question where we going to be hearing from the City of Auditor at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_09:  relative to the audit report that was done. \nSPEAKER_09:  Because I think if we do the interviews, we may want to put that off. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, no, I think well, \nSPEAKER_02:  We haven't. \nSPEAKER_02:  Frankly, the meeting to decide the agenda from. \nSPEAKER_02:  So Wednesday meeting is scheduled for Monday. \nSPEAKER_02:  So, yeah, what I think. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that is that. \nSPEAKER_02:  We need to get this done first and then we'll have to come back and when we can really focus on that both in terms of preparing and \nSPEAKER_02:  for the meeting with \nSPEAKER_02:  with her and also, you know, having a meaningful \nSPEAKER_00:  You're now having our \nSPEAKER_02:  making meaningful use of her time when she meets with us. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just wanted to make sure we didn't. \nSPEAKER_02:  But she's not at this point. We have not invited her to attend that meeting. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  right we \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a couple of... \nSPEAKER_03:  clarifications, one or questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  So one, is it possible for staff to \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  Send out the invitation to the 11. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  as early as this afternoon. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's a whole weekend involved and they may be able to address these matters on their weekend time, if opposed to during the week. That's question one. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I have a separate question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, that's the plan is after this meeting, I'll go back. We already have the list of applicants that we will send out the invitations to. And then we will also send out the notifications to the applicants who were invited in error as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then secondly, thank you, JT. And then secondly, should we go ahead \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm optimistic that we would be able to address our business on Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_03:  but should we go ahead and now get a notice out for a backup meeting to the extent that we're going to need. \nSPEAKER_03:  a second meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  either for \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  candidates that we can't meet with on Wednesday or alternatively. \nSPEAKER_03:  if we need additional time for discussion about \nSPEAKER_03:  the candidates before. \nSPEAKER_03:  voting. \nSPEAKER_02:  Why don't we deal with question number two after we pass this motion, which is just basically. \nSPEAKER_02:  Set up the... \nSPEAKER_02:  the process for going forward and then we can talk about \nSPEAKER_02:  calendars and agendas for other meetings. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  I agree. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_02:  So is there any any more discussion regarding the motion on the floor. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, seeing none, I'll call the question. Would you call the roll for the vote please? \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_08:  I \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_10:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Chattwell. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_10:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair White. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so now the question, now the issue on the floor is \nSPEAKER_02:  What all we're going to do next Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_02:  And and then to the point JP brought up, do we want to \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, \nSPEAKER_02:  think about another meeting before November 1 to do any remaining \nSPEAKER_02:  work on the redistricting commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  We could have as many as 11 interviews on \nSPEAKER_02:  on Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we would have the task of evaluating them. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh \nSPEAKER_02:  and then \nSPEAKER_02:  getting, you know, then doing the drying. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yet so what we can do is we can agenda is the interviews as we did this week as it like a study session for Wednesday's meeting and then following that we'll go into the regular agenda to approve the minutes and possibly \nSPEAKER_00:  to select the 20 to 30 sub pull and then do the selection. And then, so we can go ahead and notice that meeting today. So I could get that agenda out today. And then on Monday or Tuesday, depending on what it's look like with the response from the applicants, I can reach out to you chairwis and the chairmareil is. And then we can possibly schedule another meeting on a separate day. Either like Thursday or the following week, potentially. And then I can reach out to all the commissioners for their schedules and we can kind of coordinate from there. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, and when would be the \nSPEAKER_02:  The deadline for mending the agenda for Wednesday if we want to add an item. \nSPEAKER_02:  that's like this item we just did where you know \nSPEAKER_02:  something doesn't, I mean, say that nobody, none of those 11 people are interested anymore. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  So correct me if I'm wrong Amy. We could just we would just um withdraw the items on the floor on Wednesday. Um, otherwise we can cancel the meeting and um, notice a special meeting, which the special meeting only needs 24 hour notice instead of the 72 hours that the regular means. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  me. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we would need at least 24 hours prior to the currently scheduled Wednesday meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't really care how we do it, but \nSPEAKER_02:  I would like to have the leeway of having discussion about any procedural glitches that we feel need to be addressed before we go forward with the the selection. \nSPEAKER_02:  So if there's some way that you can \nSPEAKER_02:  put that on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_02:  to happen before we \nSPEAKER_02:  move into that. \nSPEAKER_02:  of the of the of the pool. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'd like to do that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we can do that and then if it's not necessary to hear that item that day of things go well, the item can be withdrawn. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and that would spare. \nSPEAKER_02:  everyone from having to. \nSPEAKER_02:  rush around and do a special notice and stuff like that, because I hope it would. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right. And my \nSPEAKER_03:  suggestion on the hall was \nSPEAKER_03:  mostly associated with, I think I had a mistaken understanding that it would be a longer notice period. \nSPEAKER_03:  I didn't realize we had a 24-hour notice for an emergency or special meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  These are new ones. \nSPEAKER_03:  haha \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there a, is there would there be would people be interested in it would be possible to start that meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  a little bit earlier than it's scheduled for three, I think. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm Utara \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, the regular meeting for next week is scheduled at three. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  is it? \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm sorry, but if we're going to be doing interviews, I think we'll schedule a study session, which would be a special meeting before the regular meeting. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we could do before the three o'clock, we could schedule a special meeting to conduct the study session for the interviews. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  So there'd actually be two meetings in a row. \nSPEAKER_02:  Well, I guess if we want to be done by... \nSPEAKER_02:  more or less by five o'clock, if I remember right there's somebody that follows us at five o'clock in the \nSPEAKER_00:  No, for next Wednesday, there's no meetings after. So the council chamber is available, I believe, starting at 130. \nSPEAKER_02:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  do we use the council chamber when we use zoom? Because I'm presuming that the interviews will be via zoom and our meeting would be via WebEx. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can use the same meeting for both. We will just do the Zoom meeting for both since you're ready in it. And we need the Council Chamber because that's how we broadcast it online and stream the meetings for the public to view. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the council chamber is available all Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_06:  And he's definitely one of the \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that was going to say if I remember correctly, you said it was available from 9.30 on. So we could have. \nSPEAKER_06:  you know as early as 930 a meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we have time before three o'clock. \nSPEAKER_06:  It just depends on the commissioner's availability. \nSPEAKER_03:  along that line and \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm just thinking about in fairness to the 11. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  And \nSPEAKER_03:  We did this, I think, when we selected the remaining commissioners, is that there was a bit of a break. In that case, it was, I think, a full day. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  but there was a break between \nSPEAKER_03:  when we have the interviews and when we make both the decision. \nSPEAKER_03:  and there may be a benefit to having such a break so that we're able to \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  Look at our notes. \nSPEAKER_03:  factor that in. \nSPEAKER_03:  and not necessarily disadvantage or pretend we advantage those 11 just because we haven't had it. \nSPEAKER_03:  time to kind of process. \nSPEAKER_02:  Maybe the most efficient way to do this would be \nSPEAKER_02:  when this notice would go out on Monday. \nSPEAKER_02:  JT, right? \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  So the agenda for Wednesday would go out today to be seven tours in advance for the regular meeting. And then for the special meeting, we'd only have to do it 24 hours in advance. And then we would just have to create if we decided, so just depends on what the commission decides to proceed with. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the special meeting can be that the set study session, I believe. \nSPEAKER_10:  and the \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, so that's this and so the special reading is the meeting that's going to go first and could start earlier than three. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, or you can, if you decided to start at three, we could just do the study session during the regular meeting within it. \nSPEAKER_00:  But if you wanted to start earlier, we would do a separate study session for the interviews. \nSPEAKER_00:  if that makes sense. So if you want to start at like one, 30 or two for the interviews. So we wouldn't go as late and then we can notice a special meeting for the interviews at for one, 30 or two o'clock if everyone's available and then following that we would have turned that meeting go into the regular meeting. Following the conclusion of the study session, all the interviews and then we would. \nSPEAKER_00:  Select the sub point, make this selection. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's like \nSPEAKER_02:  So the commissioner shot will suggestion was that we allow the commissioners a break in order that they can go over their notes and be ready to do the evaluation. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's just try this. Can everyone make a meeting note? \nSPEAKER_02:  And if this doesn't work, we're going to have JT polo saw later. \nSPEAKER_02:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can everyone be available at 1.30 for a meeting on Wednesday and we'll do that first. \nSPEAKER_02:  and then we'll \nSPEAKER_02:  Presumably, 11 interviews given the way these are going could be done within an hour and then we could start. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  the rest of the meeting at three or three. The right. \nSPEAKER_02:  at 330 and do the evaluation. \nSPEAKER_02:  You'd have in between time to \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, get ready for the discussion. \nSPEAKER_08:  turvized the earliest I can miss too. \nSPEAKER_08:  to a point two. Okay. All right. Good. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Is that is that work for everybody too? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, two, we're going victory signs, two signs. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, so let's plan it for, let's plan it for two, should we do two and three, 30? How's that? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, we can notice it for that and then we'll... \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, we can take care of that. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so I think... \nSPEAKER_02:  We're going to have to do emotional events, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  the space leave just consensus we're going to have a \nSPEAKER_02:  I was studying session 2 to do the remaining interviews. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then the regular commission meeting at 330 with the items that we've discussed, which will include that one about \nSPEAKER_02:  follow up discussion on logistics if we have those issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  around. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there anything else regarding \nSPEAKER_02:  Item number two that we on the agenda that we need to discuss or the panel wants to bring out. \nSPEAKER_03:  No."
