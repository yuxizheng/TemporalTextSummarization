        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_05:  Wonderful. Can we get the next item, right, please? \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendation to receive and file an overview of the annual comprehensive financial report 2022. \nSPEAKER_05:  wonderful. I believe we have a presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Good afternoon members of the Budget Ourside Committee. I am Ruby Curio Quincy, City Controller in the Department of Financial Management. \nSPEAKER_02:  Today I will present the financial results of the city as reported in the annual comprehensive financial report for fiscal year ended September 2022. \nSPEAKER_02:  financial results for fiscal year 22 were audited by KPMG, an external audit firm, and the city received an unmodified audit opinion. This opinion means that KPMG concluded the financial statements reporting the city's financial position are presented fairly in all material respects and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. \nSPEAKER_02:  In providing an overview of the city's financial position, I will start by presenting the government-wide statements that include the statement of net position and the statement of net activities. I will then follow with an overview of the general fund fund balance, revenues and other financing sources, and expenditures and other financing uses. \nSPEAKER_02:  The government-wide statements report the city's financial results at a consolidated level by reporting activities as governmental and business type. \nSPEAKER_02:  The governmental activities include governmental funds, such as the general funds, grants funds, and capital project funds. They also include the internal service funds, like fleet services and workers compensation. \nSPEAKER_02:  For business type activities, we include enterprise funds, which are funds that operate similar to a business. And these include Thailand's operating, airport, and harbor funds. We will start by looking at the statement of net position. \nSPEAKER_02:  The statement of net position reports the city's assets, liabilities, and net position. There's a lot to say here, but I'm going to keep the presentation at a high level, focusing on key points to evaluate the city's financial results. \nSPEAKER_02:  In terms of assets, we can see the city's major assets are capital assets. And these account for investment in equipment and vehicles, buildings of land and infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_02:  These assets are normally required a significant investment of city resources and are used to provide services to the community. The over $6 billion reported as capital assets does not represent available financial resources, meaning they are not liquid and cannot be used to fund current services or programs. \nSPEAKER_02:  The second highest asset reported is cash and investments. Totally in just over $2 billion. \nSPEAKER_02:  A way to measure if the city has sufficient cash is to pay its bills is to look at the liquidity ratio. This is a calculation that takes cash and investments and divides it by total current liabilities, which represent amounts to in the short term. The next slide shows this calculation. \nSPEAKER_02:  In evaluating the liquidity ratio, if we see a result less than 100%, it would indicate the city's cash and investments may not be sufficient to pay its current or short-term obligations. Based on financial results at the end of September 30, 2022, the city's liquidity ratio for governmental activities was 238%. And for the city as a whole, it was 329%. Indicating the city has cash and investments in the amount that significantly exceeds its short-term obligations, which is a very good financial position to the end. \nSPEAKER_02:  When compared to fiscal year 21, the ratio of fiscal year 22 increased for both governmental and business type. We can see cash balances have remained fairly stable and the increase in the ratios mostly due to a decrease in current or short term liabilities. \nSPEAKER_02:  Another key area in evaluating the city's financial position is to look at long term liabilities or debt obligations. As this table shows, the city's long term obligations total 2.7 billion at the end of the fiscal year, and this does exclude retirement obligations. \nSPEAKER_02:  In evaluating the city's level of debt, rating agencies look at the governmental funds debt service, which is principal and interest payments, and divided by total governmental fund expenditures. A moderate level of debt needs to be around 10%. For the city, we can see the range has been between 3% and 4% in the past three fiscal years, which is in the very good category. \nSPEAKER_02:  Another measure to use to evaluate that is calculating the city's debt per capita and comparing it across governments. \nSPEAKER_02:  For example, at September 30, 22, the city's debt per capital was 5,767, which is lower than the average of all local governments in California that reported an average of just under $9,500. \nSPEAKER_02:  And when looking at the average debt per capita of state and local governments combined, it was over 13,000. \nSPEAKER_02:  A third and very important measure of the city's debt burden is also looking at issuer ratings, assigned to the city's bond issues by rating agencies. Credit ratings are very important since they determine the interest rates at which the city borrows money. \nSPEAKER_02:  The city has received a bond rating of double A with a stable outlook for the past three fiscal years. The double A rating is the third highest of the 10 investment grade bond ratings. With the city continuing to maintain these high credit ratings, it will be able to borrow money at a lower rate. Let's now cover our retirement obligations. \nSPEAKER_02:  The most common retirement obligations are other post-employment benefits referred to as OPEB and the net pension liability. When speaking of the OPEB liability, this primary represents health care commitments for retired city employees. This liability was reported as a total of just over 4 million at the end of last year. \nSPEAKER_02:  There was a recent survey that reported op-bliabilities for the state of California, along with other public agencies which are showing on the slide. For the city, the op-bliability translated to $9 per capita, which is significantly lower than the state of California and LA County, and some of the other public agencies that's shown. \nSPEAKER_02:  Regarding the city's net pension liability, the California Public Empories Retirement System, CalPERS, provides an actual report each year to the city, outlining the total liability, pension assets, and the net pension liability for the city's miscellaneous and safety plans. For fiscal year 22, the city reported a total net pension liability of 1.3 billion. This liability is impacted by many factors and assumptions, but most significantly by investment earnings of the CalPERS portfolio. \nSPEAKER_02:  A measure of the financial health of the city's pension plans is to compare pension assets to liabilities. We refer to as a pension funding ratio. For the city, at June 30, 21, both plans reported funding ratios over 80%, indicating to be healthy or well-funded plans. When we compare the ratios to five other cities closest to Long Beach and Population, we can see the city along which has the highest funding ratios for both of its plans. For the miscellaneous plan, it's 6% higher than the next highest city. For the safety plan, it is 10% higher. \nSPEAKER_02:  There is more information to be shared on KELPERS and the city's pension costs and the budget oversight committee will be hearing a presentation in the new future on this topic. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm going to shift to the statement of activities. \nSPEAKER_02:  The statement of activity summarizes revenues, expenses, and the change in that position for the fiscal year. Again, at a consolidated level, just reporting on governmental and business type activities. This statement is prepared using the full approval basis of accounting, meaning that we report all anticipated revenues and expenses, regardless of when the actual cash is received or paid out. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will not spend a lot of time on this statement because normally we analyze revenues and expenses at a much more detailed level. We infund group or department. But a couple key points here is that the largest revenue sources for governmental activities are taxes and operating grants and contributions. \nSPEAKER_02:  these two sources accounted for 75% of revenues. \nSPEAKER_02:  In terms of expenses, for government activities the largest category was public safety, reporting 40%. Followed by community and cultural reporting just over 25%. And this category includes library, parks, recreation, and marine services. \nSPEAKER_02:  and summarizing the net change between revenues and expense activity. For governmental activities, we can see an increase in net position or \nSPEAKER_02:  otherwise known as phone balance of 77 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  Most of this increase is due to higher revenues and sales taxes, with an increase of 23 million. Property taxes reporting an increase of 9 million. And other taxes increasing by 17 million. And this last category includes transient occupancy taxes. \nSPEAKER_02:  For business type activities, the city reported a decrease of 1.3 billion. And this is directly related to the transfer of ownership of the Long Beach International Gateway Bridge from the Harbor Fund to CalTrans as part of the state highway system. \nSPEAKER_02:  Moving on to the financial results of the General Fund. \nSPEAKER_02:  Once again, there's a lot to cover in the general fund, but once again, I'm going to focus on the key points and one of the most important is fund balance, which is an indicator of the city's financial strength. \nSPEAKER_02:  Fund balances define as the difference between assets and liabilities, and it is not the same as budgetary funds available, which is used to determine available resources to program or appropriate. Just wanted to make that clarification. \nSPEAKER_02:  On this table, we report general fund fund balance by various categories and provide three years of data for comparison purposes. If we look at the total fund balance, we can see an increasing balance over the past few years. And much of that is due to a recovering economy after the pandemic, and additional funding provided through Long Beach Recovery Act, including the Federal American Rescue Plan Act or ARPA. \nSPEAKER_02:  To further evaluate the general funds financial strength, we can also look at whether the city has sufficient reserves to maintain levels of service to the community during revenue shortfalls or unanticipated expenditure increases. \nSPEAKER_02:  The expenditure coverage calculation provides a SAT measure. And we calculate this ratio by taking unrestricted fund balances, which are shown within the blue box in the table, and dividing it by total general fund expenditures and transfers out. \nSPEAKER_02:  The general fund percent of 35.2% translates to just over four months of reserves. The city council's financial policy is to maintain no less than two months of emergency and operating reserves in the general fund. And as of last September, the city is reporting on an accounting basis more than twice that recommendation. \nSPEAKER_02:  From this ratio, we can see that Jennifer would be able to continue to operate with no revenues for just over four months. \nSPEAKER_02:  Also to note is that the number of months has been increasing over the past years as a result of fund balance increasing at a higher rate than expenditures. \nSPEAKER_02:  And just one final note at the end of last year emergency reserves were reported at 47.8 million and operating reserves at 15.7 million. These reserve amounts are part of the committed category of fund balance on the table. \nSPEAKER_02:  For General Fund revenues and other financing sources, the largest revenue category is taxes. Compared to fiscal year 21, this category increased over 43 million or about 10%. An increase of 23 million was reported in sales and use tax due to strong performance in the general consumer goods and restaurants and hotels categories. There was also a notable increase from the unanticipated price increases in fuel and automobiles. \nSPEAKER_02:  Transcend occupancy tax or TOT also reported an increase of over $9 million when compared to the prior year. And TOT at this point has shown significant improvement and now exceeds the average revenue reported in pre-pandemic periods. \nSPEAKER_02:  Property taxes also increase by $4.5 million, mostly due to citywide valuation increases from new development and improvements. \nSPEAKER_02:  The last row here on a table, other financing sources, reported the largest decrease of $92 million when compared to the prior year, and a decrease was due to transfers into the general fund from the general grants fund being higher in the prior year. As a result of the majority of our money, being used in that year to fund government services, and it funded police and parks and recreation costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  We also noted a lower transfer into the general fund from the employee benefits fund related to pension costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  For general fund expenditures and other financing uses, there was a decrease of $68 million when compared to the prior year. \nSPEAKER_02:  significant changes included a decrease of 16 million in public safety due to savings from position vacancies in the fire and police departments. This resulted from increased separations, terminations, and hiring challenges during their great resignation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Public Works reported an increase of $3 million due to more investment in infrastructure repairs and maintenance while capital improvements decreased 25 million due to land and property purchases that occurred in fiscal year 21 for homeless services housing and fire station 9. \nSPEAKER_02:  In the other financing uses category, which is again the last row on the table, we noted a decrease resulting from a one-time general fund transfer out that occurred in fiscal year 21 for $30 million related to the court ruling against the city on measure and litigation. \nSPEAKER_02:  In summary, the net change between General Fund Rebony's and expenses was a positive 58.2 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  This summarizes general fund results and concludes my presentation. And I am available to answer any questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I see we have a motion from Council Member Aronga. Can I get a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  I see you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, I have a first and a second, so we can begin our discussion. I believe we're going to start with Councilmember Aranga. \nSPEAKER_05:  question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  in regards to the revenue. \nSPEAKER_00:  a page 11. \nSPEAKER_00:  You, the committee, agree with your majority because of taxes. Where does the retail tax fit in this equation here? Regarding the agreement that we made with the county. \nSPEAKER_00:  a few years ago, I haven't read it, but the action we took. \nSPEAKER_00:  where they were going to implement a tax on the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we are proactively \nSPEAKER_00:  You're done man. \nSPEAKER_00:  and create a text. \nSPEAKER_00:  Haruza Pelin. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So sales tax, so the rebates, is that what you're talking about rebates to businesses? Yeah. Okay, so those are- \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's part of it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, those are reported as expenses and so they do not affect the taxes revenue. The tax revenue that you see reported here is at gross. Everything that is collected by the city, any rebates would be reported as expenditures in the general fund. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh-huh. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councilmember and Dougan, did you have some questions for staff? \nSPEAKER_04:  Where is the TOT, the $9 million increase, which category is that out of? \nSPEAKER_04:  That is in the taxes category. It is in the taxes. \nSPEAKER_02:  That is in the \nSPEAKER_04:  taxes, comprises of \nSPEAKER_02:  It's comprised of sales tax, property taxes, utility users taxes, transit occupancy taxes, some portions of business license taxes as well. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I had a couple of questions. So thank you for that great presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  So just clarification for me. So on slide number six, when we have the debt per capita, is the per capita like per thousand people per person. Kind of sometimes the dollars are a million, some are a thousand, sometimes they're. It's based on population. OK, so this is per person. \nSPEAKER_02:  per person. Correct. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then... \nSPEAKER_05:  On slide number eight when we're talking about the net pension liability. This is for clarification from me. So under public safety, I see some cities, it separates it for fire and police. Is that just kind of like the policy related to the way that we do our pension system here in the city of Long Beach is the why they're not separate? \nSPEAKER_02:  They may have multiple plans that have different rates and funding ratios because they adopted different funds later. You might find that quite a bit. For the first four cities, they just have one plan for fire, one police that CalPERS reports on. But it is possible to find multiple extra evaluations for cities. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Wonderful. Thank you. Oh, and then for slide 10, can you just talk me through for when you talk about general fund reserves, what's the difference between emergency reserves and operating reserves and how does that dictate how we're able to utilize those as the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  So for that question, I want to ask Grace Yoon, our budget manager, to speak to it, since she's more familiar with the requirements for each. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, emergency reserves are generally set aside in our financial policy, which I'll also talk about in the next presentation for what they call like acts of God type of situations, earthquakes, things that are not really pandemics. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, and we actually did in fact, we did in fact utilize both the operating and the emergency reserves during the pandemic itself. The operating reserves is set aside to be more of a general operating fluctuation reserve so that in any given year if the revenue might be down on more of like on a one time basis for certain smaller economic occurrences. The operating reserve is something that we could tap into. Generally, the city has been very good or in practice not to really tap into it like on a more casual basis. It has been, again, prior to the pandemic not touched and just been growing over the years and then during the pandemic was the first time in many years that we tapped into both the operating and the emergency reserves. But fortunately that was able to be replenished. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and so I'm assuming that's why the level of operating reserves in 2022 before there was funding. I'm assuming from the federal, the state and federal government related to expenses for COVID-19, which is why we had to tap into those operating reserves. \nSPEAKER_03:  Correct. In FY20 we had a big deficit in the general fund and we utilized these reserves to balance it and then once we received the federal funds there was a general fund money freed up to be able to replenish those reserves. \nSPEAKER_03:  great. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  And then you mentioned, can you just go back over on slide 11 for the other financing sources? Could you just kind of rattle those off when we're time for me as to what that constitutes? \nSPEAKER_02:  Sure. So we did see a decrease over 92 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  And it was related to using that ARPA money and we reported the ARPA money in the general grants fund. And so what we did is transfer them money into the general fund in fiscal year 21. That transfer was much higher than in 22, which caused a decrease in 22 in terms of transfers in. And the second item was the employee benefits fund transferred in less money. \nSPEAKER_02:  In fiscal year 20, you're related to pension costs. \nSPEAKER_05:  Gotcha. And then for those who might be listening, they don't know what ARPA is, could you just specify what ARPA is? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, that is the American Rescue Plan Act which provided the city actually about $136 million to be spent in numerous categories which also helped fund the Long Beach Recovery Act program and a part of the Long Beach Recovery Act we were able to cover some of the revenue losses that Grace just spoke of. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, wonderful. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that is it for me. So any other questions from my fellow committee members? Seeing none, we can go to public comment. \nSPEAKER_01:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number two, please line up at the podium at this time. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. I think we had a motion a second, right? Yeah, earlier. OK. So then we can go ahead and go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Wonderful. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can you read the next item, please? Recommendation to receive and file an overview of any updates."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  on the Long Beach, Vegetary, and Financial Policy. \nSPEAKER_04:  I believe we have a presentation for this one as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, we do. Good afternoon, Chair Wix Odie and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. I am very happy to be here at our very first BOC meeting of the FY24 Budget Development season. \nSPEAKER_03:  This presentation is to provide an overview of our city's budgetary and financial policies. Our financial policies are adopted by City Council and they provide written guidance for how local government officials and staff should approach fiscal issues in core financial areas. However, I do want to say that these are not legally binding in themselves but they serve as good checks and balances and guidance for good decision making. \nSPEAKER_03:  The packet that you have provides a full set of the current policies, which is also available online in our budget book. The slide set that I will be going over today, you can consider more of like a cliff notes version of the 22 policies to provide a general overview. So I am planning to go through all 22 policies and then if you have any questions, happy to answer them. \nSPEAKER_03:  So starting with the first policy, the first policy is that the budget for the general fund will be structurally balanced. A budget is structurally balanced if it does not plan to spend more on ongoing services, then it receives an ongoing revenue. So we're talking regular revenue coming in, covering regular expenses. This is a necessary component of good financial management and fiscal discipline that really helps sustain consistent delivery of services to residents. An unbalanced budget, basically spending more than an ongoing revenue is anticipated to be received. Can undermine the city's ability to deal with financial problems. However, since the pandemic, the general fund has been balanced with the help of one time funds. And it is still reflecting a structural imbalance where projected ongoing revenues is less than projected ongoing expense. However, as we've discussed and presented to City Council in the past, this is something staff has recommended and City Council has approved to help the city residents and businesses recover from the pandemic. And also, since we received a large influx of assistance from the federal government. \nSPEAKER_03:  The second policy is that at minimum the proposed annual budget should include a three year general fund surplus or shortfall projection. Multi-year financial projections do allow us to examine what the future might bring. It also allows us to discuss how the potential future situation might impact current decisions in order to maintain a strong fiscal, a fiscally strong city and our ability to maintain or improve our services. We are currently providing a four year projection that was in our last March outlook. We provided a four year projection and we will also be providing an updated four year projection in the proposed budget book that will be released in August. \nSPEAKER_03:  The third policy states that the annual budget process is the main method used by the city to determine the annual service priorities and plan. The annual budget process, the one that we're engaged in currently, allows the city council, city management team, residents and businesses to consider services and service priorities and associated revenue decisions in a holistic way based on an overall assessment of all programs and revenues. And that assessment is conducted through very thorough public meetings, budget hearings that are upcoming and a lot of these meetings as well, the budget oversight committee meetings as well. That type of in depth conversation doesn't really exist for mid-year budget changes. So this policy is just recognizing that we do want to keep mid-year changes at a minimum. They do are sometimes necessary for technical corrections or if we receive a grant or if there's a time sensitive action. So those are necessary and the budget office does facilitate periodic budget adjustment letters that you will see coming to city council. Budget adjustments will also be included in certain council letters as relevant. But overall the main bulk of the budget of this policy is indicating that we like to have it be done through the budget process. \nSPEAKER_03:  The fourth policy states that fees will be set to fully recover costs, except where there is a greater public benefit through the use of a lower fee. An example might be where full recovery may adversely impact overall revenues, or it may discourage participation in programs where participation benefits the overall community. We have made tremendous progress in this area with this policy, with our multi-year citywide fee study that is in progress. We have come to City Council with those findings at different stages, and this study has been helping to identify what is our actual cost of service, and make informed decisions on how to set those fees. \nSPEAKER_03:  the fifth policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  States that one time resources will not be used to fund ongoing operations and that instead they will be used for one time uses So again using one time resources just for one time purposes is another basic tenant of good financial management The policy also notes that 5% of any general fund funds available at the end of the year will be automatically set aside to fund unfunded liabilities or in an unfunded liability reserve So the city has been historically Excellent at following this policy except as I mentioned before in recent years We have been utilizing one time funds made available through the federal government through the Long Beach Recovery Act to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and to avoid harmful service reductions to the community while we recover In terms of the 5% unfunded liability reserve the city has been setting aside This every year where there have been funds available at the end of the year \nSPEAKER_03:  The six policy states that before approving any capital expenditure, the City Council should consider both the capital or the one time costs and the operating or the ongoing components of the costs, regardless of the funding source. This practice and this policy is reflecting that the capital project is important, but also the ongoing cost that come from that capital project is also something that we need to take into consideration. We do identify operating costs for most capital items, but this is not necessarily possible in all situations. In some cases, we do not always have that information readily available. Some examples might be divide by nine projects or work council priority projects are given to. In infrastructure projects, we may not always know what is the long term impact of that, but in those cases, we do disclose that there may be operating costs in the future that need to be addressed or considered so that that disclosure is made and can be considered during the decision making process. \nSPEAKER_03:  policy 7 and 8. This slide talks about that. The 7th policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  provides an outline of the type of fund balances that can exist that is consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles. So a lot of the categories that you saw in Ruby's prior presentation, this just lists that as well. So we're consistent with accounting principles. And the eighth policy states the guidelines on maintaining our emergency and operating reserves that we also discussed in the prior presentation. And so just to reiterate, at the beginning of FY23, our operating reserves was about 16 million. This is inclusive of our measure B reserve. And this was about 2.9% of our normal operating reserves, which is within our policy range of 2 to 7%. And then our emergency reserve is about 48 million, which is about 8.6% of our normal operating expenditures, which is below our target of 10%, but it is above our minimum of 8. So we are in compliance with our internal policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  The 9th policy says that financial management department will in concert with any relevant operating department will develop and present to city council any recommended reserve policy for each city fund which will be adopted or modified by the city council. So this review is something that's in progress and something that happens on a regular basis. Financial management and the department's generally watch funds available throughout the year and at the end of the year and you will see that reported in our mid-year performance report our year-end performance report and also you will find that information available in the proposed budget book that's coming out and this does help us track certain health of funds. For example, the refuse fund was drawing down on their funds available for a number of years. They started off with a very large funds available and so we were monitoring that and working with the department they were able to update some of the rates and get those approves to now replenish the funds. So those types of tracking and working with the departments are currently happening. \nSPEAKER_03:  The 10th policy says that revenue projections are to be objectively prepared using a reasonably expected approach so that there is an equal chance of coming in higher or lower than the projections. Of course, revenue projections are very fluid and can be volatile depending on the data that's available at the time of the projection. Many of the city's key revenues are subject to material variation depending on the economy. And so no revenue projection is likely to be completely accurate when the economy is changing direction or moving quickly. But we do our best to estimate what will actually happen trying to balance that there's an equal chance that the actuals will be higher than what we projected or lower. So we try to keep that in mind when we're making our forecasts. \nSPEAKER_03:  The 11 policy says that revenues with a high variable portion may have only a portion or none budgeted for operations. So this really the idea behind this is that if you do have a revenue source that is so volatile, that we don't want to bank our operating expenses on it. In the case that you have multiple years where it's down, and then another multiple years where it's up, we just don't want to be that unstable when it comes to our ongoing operating expenses. An example of this is oil revenue. Oil revenue can be really high like it was in the past couple years, but some years it can drop unexpectedly without warning down to be really low. So we are always trying to keep oil budgeted at $55 a barrel that's been kind of the sweet spot that we found in the past few years. Although in the past there have been temptation to even go up as high as $80, and when we did do that and then budget operations based on that, of course the following year it tanked down to 20 and so it just creates a lot of volatility. So this policy is talking about that kind of approach where we budget really a portion of the revenue that's the most stable. \nSPEAKER_03:  The 12th policy says for any proposed city council action, including those from non-city manager departments or elected officials, an analysis is to be provided. So essentially a fiscal impact statement with the council letters that talk about projected or potential fiscal impact on current or future revenues on expenditures and resources, also describing impact on staff resources and also impact on existing city priorities. And the idea really is that before city council makes any decision on any requested action or recommendation, you have before you the best information possible in terms of any impact, fiscal or on staff or on capacity. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we are currently in compliance with this policy, as you will see. All of our council letters have a fiscal impact statement that accompany the content. \nSPEAKER_03:  Policy 13, this says the budget will include funding for cost for services in the current year. This is more of a general financial policy that says we budget for and fund for most of our annual cost. What this is reflecting is that we do this but not for everything. Most governments, including Long Beach, do not have the revenues to budget for the cost of all the maintenance necessary to maintain capital infrastructure or to pay for all post employee costs. This includes, for example, some building maintenance, some retirement costs, all which are unfunded on an annual ongoing basis. So this is just. \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of providing that nuance that we are budgeting for the cost for that year, but it may not cover all of our costs. So in those cases we want to disclose it. So we do have a section in the proposed budget book about our unfunded liabilities, where we talk about costs that are not fully covered, but it is on our radar and we are at least covering for the expenses for that year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Policy 14 says the city will prepare an annual financial report in accordance with the general accepted accounting principles and will include a written description of the basis of accounting in the Act for and we are currently in compliance with this as you saw in the previous presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  The policy 15 says the city's annual comprehensive financial report will be made available to the city council, the public bondholders, and rating agencies after completion of the annual audit. And in addition, it says that there will be periodic reporting on the budgetary status of the city, particularly the general fund and other funds that have unusual or problematic status. And this policy also says that any major or critical issue will be reported as soon as it is practical. And so we are in compliance with this as well. We report the aquifer that is available and we do come with periodic performance report status updates, including a year-end wrap-up performance report to city council. \nSPEAKER_03:  Policy 16 says the city manager will annually present a brief report discussing the high level financial status of each major fund and the report may be incorporated as a component of the budget's fund summary. And so this is something we are in compliance with when the proposed budget comes out or you could also see the current budget at the very back of the book. There is a whole section on fund summary so every single fund group will have its own financial status description of the revenue source and its use. And in the executive summary report of the budget book it also goes into more narrative detail on current events of those funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  policy 17, this policy on grants, it says city will seek grants that address city priorities and provide substantial net benefit. Appropriate grant support levels will be maintained. So this is a policy that just sets basic guidelines for grants and grants management. And this is something that is done throughout the city in many departments and we are currently in compliance with this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  policy 18 says debt will not fund operations and debt limits will be adopted. Capital leases for vehicles will be part of a comprehensive strategy. This is again a policy that just sets basic guidelines for debt management. The city does follow this and actually has a more detailed debt policy that has been approved by City Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  Policy 19 is a similar one to the one before. It's about investments and this sets the policy on investments. But again, the city has approved a more detailed investment policy that is managed by our city treasure and our treasury bureau in financial management. \nSPEAKER_03:  policy 20, this says a long-term general financial plan will be adopted that includes general approaches on revenues, economic growth, control and management of costs and method of service delivery. So the city does not have a formal plan done by a consultant right now, but we do prepare a three to four year outlook as I discussed before that is reviewed and discussed as part of the budget process. So that does provide a lot of context to discuss strategy and what next steps might be in the mid short to mid term. \nSPEAKER_03:  policy 21, it says financial policies will be reviewed every three years and the city manager will report annually on any noncompliance. So reviewing of policies does help keep them current and also reminds everyone that we have policies and the need to follow them or understand where we might not be following them. And this review is also consistent with this policy. The last time we did that was part of the 23 budget process. \nSPEAKER_03:  when we made a tweak to one of the policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then the last policy, the 22nd one, so says administrative procedures shall be consistent with the adopted city council budgetary and financial policies. This is a bit of a catch all policy that just says we will be establishing appropriate policies and administrative procedures that are not inconsistent or that go against these financial policies. And we are currently in compliance with that as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that concludes my presentation and I am happy to answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you for that. Can I get a motion in a second? We can begin discussion. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Wonderful. Council member Ranga. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  Do we got my head soon? \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's long overdue that this presentation is something that will benefit the remainder of the city council, my colleagues. So, chair, I don't know what the plan is for this presentation here, but I think it's the next one that will be beneficial for my colleagues in the city council. And that's all I got to say about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I guess I'll just say as a follow up to that. Is this something, a presentation? I know you said it was part of the fiscal year 23 budget discussion. Was this something that was previously presented to City Council? \nSPEAKER_03:  So it was not presented in this format, going through each and every policy. The conversation for the 23 was that we highlighted one of the policies, which was the revenue projection ones, that was being proposed for an adjustment. Prior to that, it was that we would be projecting revenues at a reasonably conservative basis. And the change was to do revenue projections on a reasonably expected basis, that 50-50. Instead of maybe like 48, or you know, kind of just airing a little bit on the conservative side. That was discussed, but this full presentation going through each one was not part of that review. With the full council. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, I know as the Budget Oversight Committee will make recommendations to Council related to the budget itself, but I think Council Member Arangas, I'm assuming suggestion here would be around actually delivering this presentation to the full Council body. What would be the process for that? \nSPEAKER_03:  You can make that recommendation here and then we as staff will take that and can put agendas and item at city council and and that agenda item would be a receive and file a presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  understood. Now that recommendation is that something that then would be I'm assuming separate from the receiving file for this particular agenda item. So with that, if we wanted to make that recommendation, would that then come after this agenda? We vote on this agenda item where it doesn't need to come during the discussion right now. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think I will ask Taylor to confirm but I think that recommendation could be part of this motion to receive and file and also recommend that staff present this presentation to City Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  That is correct. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. Councillor Member Ranga, you want to continue with, I was going to say I want to suggest you to be, I want to leave you continue with the discussion and then I'll circle back with you since you're the maker of the motion if you want to add that. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we'd have anyone to do that, yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, I'll come back to you after we discuss. Council Member Duggan. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a couple of questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So in general, these policies are guidelines. You said they're not legally binding, but we use these as kind of buffers to keep us on the right track. First question regarding number two. \nSPEAKER_05:  key factors impacting economic and financial status. There's decisions made about budgetary planning and financial decision making. What would be \nSPEAKER_05:  That seems very broad. Can you just expound on that just a little bit? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, certainly. Were you talking about 12 or 2? \nSPEAKER_05:  multi-year financial projections. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks for coming. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. So what we do in the budget office is annually, we do look at the upcoming year, the year that we are looking at the proposed budget. And we take the data that we have available currently with the current fiscal year, how it's going. Obviously, if it's earlier on in the budget process, we have only a couple months into the current fiscal year as data that's available for making out your projections. By the time we get to the proposed budget, both we have a little bit more data that we factor in. And then we \nSPEAKER_03:  Incorporate in what we know for revenue trends also on the expenditure side what's happening with negotiations What are some of the projections that we're getting from CalPERS? Do we know of like a major new debt that we're taking on that's gonna happen in a couple years? So all of these things line by line we go through a process of making a forecast both on the revenue side and the expenditure side looking at both Actions that's happening within the city Like negotiations as well as external economic broader actions Working with for example like our sales tax consultants on trends that they're seeing or development that's happening that might be starting to You know do a little boost in our revenues that we see and then all of that is incorporated into a forecast and ultimately reflects At the end of the day when we are looking at where revenue land and where our ongoing expenditures land \nSPEAKER_03:  is revenue higher than expense. And we do that for each year, that we do the projection in the out years, and then present that to council to give the context of, here's what, assuming all things kept neutral, here is what the forecast is showing. One thing I will say is, when we get to that year, that forecast always changes because we are taking action, city council is taking action, and making changes based on that forecast. And so the numbers will vary depending on some of if their reductions made, if there's moved to increase fees, or consolidation or efficiencies and operations, all of those things will impact the forecast. So it is an iterative process, but that is what this financial policy encourages us to do is to have that thoughtful conversation and not just look one year ahead. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great. \nSPEAKER_05:  in item four. \nSPEAKER_05:  How is cost recovery calculated? Is it pretty black and white? I mean, it seems like it would be black and white. Cost recovery, how much does it cost? I've, and, \nSPEAKER_05:  over the past years, we've been trying to catch up on making sure our policy includes cost recovery department by department. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm just curious since we haven't really done a lot of cost recovery, is each department following the same standard for that? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, that's a great question. So because of this policy, a couple of years ago, we actually launched a citywide multi-year cost recovery study. And so we are currently in the middle of that right now. So prior to that, it had been many years since we had done a comprehensive study. There might have been someone off in departments because every department, many departments have fees for different things and for different purposes. But prior to the study, there wasn't a comprehensive citywide look being done. But right now that centralized study is almost halfway or more than halfway done. And we are working with a consultant who has developed a formula, so to speak, for developing cost. It is sometimes not straightforward. The formula could be straightforward, but you could also consider to account certain overhead costs. Do you cost direct costs? Do you account indirect costs? So that study has been looking at that and establishing that parameter and going to each department. \nSPEAKER_03:  and doing a study of each of their fees. And so that has been brought to City Council, usually in two presentations. The first presentation that will come to Council is a report of the findings of that study. How is this department doing in terms of cost recovery? Is this department overcharging? Or what we're finding a lot, we're not actually fully recovering our fees. And then the departments will make a recommendation on whether they actually recommend increasing their fees, decreasing, deleting, consolidating. So that presentation is brought to Council. And then a couple months later, the actual fee hearing comes to City Council, where there's an actual vote to change the master fees in charge of schedule that would change the rate. Whether a department, what they recommend, again, like this policy says, will depend on a variety of factors. It could depend on comparable markets and other things. And those are discussed as part of that first presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we're actually really excited about this. A lot of cities, this is a very challenging and administrative study to do. So many cities may just not get to it. And so you just charge fees. Maybe it grows by some sort of CPI type of action each year. But there isn't, there is a little bit of a, it's very easy for there to be a mismatch between what the fees are and the services are. So we're really excited that we've been able to engage in this study. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we \nSPEAKER_05:  when will that study be completed? You said it's almost halfway done, correct? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, so we've had so far development services, parks, and health department, just the physician services bureau come already. That was round one. We had energy resources on public works, that was round two. And most recently we had fire, police, and health and human services, the environmental health bureau. That was round three. And we still have city manager, including special events and filming, financial management, airport, and library, upcoming. That's currently being conducted right now. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Let me just keep going through my notes here. \nSPEAKER_05:  So in item six, capital projects, we budgeted and funded. One of my questions is, \nSPEAKER_05:  In the last paragraph, it talks about costs that are not significant do not need to be analyzed. I'm curious as to what makes something considered not significant. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a great question. Since it does sound very, you know, that statement alone could be taken out and potentially misused. I think generally what this is saying is, \nSPEAKER_03:  Overall, we want to make sure that we are \nSPEAKER_03:  paying for the service that we are engaging in in case of capital, that we have enough funds to do the actual capital project. If we're building a playground, we have enough money to build that playground. The bulk of this is saying, well, also, don't forget, if you build a playground once you build it every year after that, you may need to maintain it. That's something we've actually sometimes forgotten about in the past. And then a couple of years later, we're like, oh! \nSPEAKER_03:  We need 200,000 for replenishing the wood chips or something. We didn't discuss that. We were just so excited about building that playground. We didn't talk about it. So the bulk of this is making sure that we can actually build the asset and then maintain the asset or at least understand that we're going to have to solve the problem of how we're going to maintain the asset. There's probably a lot of other small minor costs or factors that could be part of that conversation. And I think this is just more of like a protection that this is not supposed to be a rigid formula where we have to report on every potential cost that exists, but make sure that we're covering the majority of the ground for funding an asset and it's ongoing costs. \nSPEAKER_03:  couple more. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So in item seven, types of fund balance, three and four, I can see that committed is basically a motion of city council assigned. It seems that it can just be, it's... \nSPEAKER_05:  Not a motion of City Council. Are there parameters for assigned fund balance items? Does that make sense? \nSPEAKER_02:  So anything under assigned would be under the authority of the city manager that doesn't require city council action and it could be items like for example carry over appropriations at the end of the year that we're not spent. But I believe budget office still goes to council to get them approved after the fiscal year and closes so items like that would go under the assigned category. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so it's more generic and usually it does come back to council. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, for subsequent year appropriations and normally that is covered through the year and performance report that Grace alluded to earlier. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Number 11, stable revenue sources. \nSPEAKER_05:  Maybe you covered this, but what would you say the parameters are? \nSPEAKER_05:  for stable revenue sources. And can you give another example other than oil? \nSPEAKER_03:  I think oil would be the main example in this case. We don't actually have \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, too many other, or I'm not able to think of one right now that is as clear as oil where we know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Looks like we're trending at $80 a barrel and we're budgeting and you'll see in the upcoming proposed budget. It's budgeted at $55. So that's a pretty, for our city, a pretty clear distinction. The other revenue sources like the taxes Ruby was talking about earlier. \nSPEAKER_03:  those we just consider mostly um \nSPEAKER_03:  part of stable revenue it may go up or may go down and that's the the bit of the art of trying to determine where is that 50% best projection but as it goes up and as it goes down we try to find that middle as opposed to just \nSPEAKER_03:  you know kind of taking a bit of it out and then not budgeting for it at all. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  is Councilmember Duggan? Is it okay if Councilmember Raga asks the following question? \nSPEAKER_05:  That's the follow-up. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, well, that would be the situation where here years ago. \nSPEAKER_01:  A while back, oil was at $100 a barrel and we were at 70 something I think. So right now, when you talk about projectors are at 80 and we're at 55, is there any way to put it as magic wand that crystal ball to see, is that going to change anytime soon? Is it going to go up? Is it going down? \nSPEAKER_01:  what what like what's the destiny \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, that's a great question. If I knew that answer, I probably wouldn't be here. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye, Upper. \nSPEAKER_03:  But it's a great question. One thing that we are seeing, though, is that that incredibly high price is looks like it's trending downward, at least from the beginning part of the year to the current part of the year. So we do feel comfortable still with the $55 a barrel as that cushion. We also sometimes are also taking into consideration the overall context too, not just the price of that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Even if oil prices are doing well, knowing that our city is looking at oil as a revenue source that is declining and something that we're going to move away from in the future, is that something we want to up in terms of a covering structural ongoing operating costs? And so those are all just kind of things that we balance out in feeling comfortable with the $55 a barrel. But your memory is absolutely right. There were times where we were budgeted lower than $55. We went down as low as $30, but the actual revenue was very high. And then when we \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe you were here when we moved the budget to that be that high the following year then oil crashed and so it has been a volatile source that we're trying to find that steady state place to budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, two more questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Number 18, debt maintained at appropriate levels. Can you just go over, there's no formal policy for capital leases. \nSPEAKER_05:  They're watched closely for conformance with budget. During the year, I feel like we have approved some really big leases. So I'm interested in how that works. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, we have our Jesse from our Treasury Bureau here who can talk of anything you'd like about debt and investments. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi, good afternoon. Just your take-off assistant city treasure. So yes, there have been a number of leases that have gone forward for city approval. \nSPEAKER_00:  The city does have a master lease program and that has with Bank of America and that was authorized in 2019 for 200 million So that max level has already been authorized and calculated and analyzed But when we go for leases for our various equipment \nSPEAKER_00:  They're usually for smaller amounts and that is done in coordination with budget and the various departments to ensure the funding is there to support that lease item. \nSPEAKER_00:  And any lease that's under that master lease program typically range from a term from three years to 15 years. So it's a little bit shorter to medium term debt. \nSPEAKER_05:  just to clarify. So we have 200 million basically that we can use, we can lease from. But on a monthly basis we may have \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know, three to ten million dollars that we lease. Is it coming out of that two million dollar lease program? Or are we budgeted for something like that? \nSPEAKER_00:  It would be actually budgeted. We just have, you could think of the master of these program as a credit card limit. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that credit card limit would be set at 200 million with Bank of America. And then we submit documentation with each lease to show and demonstrate that the funding is secured. \nSPEAKER_00:  and it has been budgeted for and accounted for by each individual department and project. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we're paying off that credit card amount every time we have a budgeted item that the City Council approves. \nSPEAKER_00:  What are the crimes gained against plants? What's worse. We actually ain't no right. That group needs proper media to respond to people that do this right when they are broke. How I- Get moreITH art and who ain't fully indecent, Turkcan medicine, \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Last question. \nSPEAKER_05:  How with our funds, if we are managing them, excuse me for just a minute, I want to get my notes here. \nSPEAKER_05:  The question basically was, I'm interested in who manages our funds. How do we have oversight? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, by the way, for this. Good presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, thank you. And thank you for that question. The management of funds really is a collaborative effort between the departments. Many of the departments, you could say, are the main operating department that might be utilizing a fund. Let's say, for example, the Health Fund, the Health Department is the one going out, getting those grants, tracking staffing, managing the staff. And so those funds, the management of the revenue coming in and the expenditures coming out, are managed operationally by that department. The budget office has an oversight role in that where we're looking on a periodic basis, citywide, all revenues, and expense, all funds, checking the status of everything. So we would be doing that both during the year looking at, well, here was the budget for revenue. How does the current status actual look? What does the year end projections look like? We do that for expenditures and then do an assessment of, oh, this fund is looking in trouble if this is our year end projection or the current pace of spending or the current rate of revenue receipt. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then we'll work with the departments to maybe understand, oh, maybe there was just a delay in a payment or maybe there was an error in entry or something like that. So we'll have that oversight. There are some funds where the budget office and financial management take greater control because multiple departments are involved. An example of that would be like our employee benefits fund. We do have like our human resources, financial management, some attorneys office, for example, charge to that fund. But that fund is also the central fund that collects and remits our employee benefits. So like our CalPERS pension cost that Ruby mentioned earlier, that's out of the employee benefits fund. And so our vacation, our sick leave, that's out of vacation, our employee benefits fund. So funds like that we'll manage centrally, we'll be looking at both the revenue and the expense. And also the budget office helps facilitate an overall look at the budgetary funds available. The both the projection and where we think we'll be ending and then an assessment at actual year end, which is not just revenue expense, but what is any funds available that has been either accumulating or being drawn down upon, like I mentioned before, like the Refuse Fund for several years. The revenue was less than expense and it was drawing down on funds available. But we had a little bit of a cushion of time because that funds available was so large. Until. \nSPEAKER_03:  A rate study was able to be conducted and completed. \nSPEAKER_04:  All good, council member. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, done. Okay. Wonderful. And then I just have a couple of questions. Some of them you've actually already answered between Councilmember Rang and Councilmember Dougan. So one was just looking at number five, which is one-time resources are for one-time uses. You state that 5% of one-time revenues are set aside for unfunded liabilities. And I was just curious in a typical year, so not a year after a global pandemic. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  one time. \nSPEAKER_04:  on average about how much is that usually? Like how much are we actually setting aside? Just kind of give people a benchmark. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, they haven't been too large. Prior to the pandemic, again, when we were doing our, our, \nSPEAKER_03:  way of budgeting revenue that was more on the reasonably conservative side. We would range sometimes from half a million to a couple million of surplus a year. There was one year that was like four or five. We were like, oh, wow. But when you consider how large our general fund is, this between 600 to 700 million, sometimes that surplus amount at the end of the year is calculated to be less than half a percent. So 13Depse\ufffd\ufffd of surplus. And so. \nSPEAKER_03:  When we do 5% of that, you know, like a 5% of a million would be the general. Right now, what we have in that reserve is about 3 million, and that's just been what's been accumulating over all of these years. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then just for looking at slide number nine, looking at seven and eight, just to clarify. So emergency reserves, you said right now we're at like 9%. Was that the number? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll just make sure I miss night and miss it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, let me look that up for you right now. Okay. I know you said it. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know you said any presentation I just missed it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, so our emergency reserve, which is around 48 million or little less, is about 8.6% of normal operating expenditure. So that's above the minimum of eight for our financial policy, but below the target of 10. That's right. So there's a little bit above the minimum. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's right. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then question, for the operating reserves, what's the reason for the max? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  with 7% max. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think part of it is balancing the concept of how much do you store away in a savings account and how much do you. \nSPEAKER_03:  actually spend on services to the community. And so it is, I think, with \nSPEAKER_00:  and so \nSPEAKER_03:  this max with the emergency reserve and there are other, as it says here, other reserve may be established.
