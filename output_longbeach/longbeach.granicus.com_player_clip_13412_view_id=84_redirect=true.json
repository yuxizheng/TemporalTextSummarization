        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  The next item is a recommendation to adopt a resolution amending the rules and procedures of the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  to include a commission disclosure policy and the campaign contribution policy which was previously adopted by the commission. Taylor, are you going to lead us on this or is Commissioner shot well? \nSPEAKER_00:  I have volunteered to lead you on this one. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Since you asked me to make some changes, so I'll walk you through a little refresher of what I did. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the copy of the commission's rules and regulations includes two things. It includes \nSPEAKER_00:  You're campaign contribution policy that was adopted as a separate resolution quite some time ago. And then it includes the disclosure policy right after that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I made some, I made eight weeks. \nSPEAKER_00:  two \nSPEAKER_00:  It's on page 16 to section D to make the language consistent in D1, D2 and D3, D1. \nSPEAKER_00:  was worded a little bit differently. The commission had asked for that to be fixed. So those are the changes that were made. So if you adopt \nSPEAKER_00:  this policy as it's written. \nSPEAKER_00:  that will become the commission's policy. If you want to make changes to it, you can absolutely do that by motion and consent of the entire commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  four. \nSPEAKER_00:  you can make no changes to it. So, completely up to you. I'm available for questions if you have any. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Anyone have any questions? \nSPEAKER_07:  Any questions? \nSPEAKER_07:  JP in our commission to shout well sorry \nSPEAKER_04:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  There was one change I think we talked about the last meeting. I'm sorry I didn't catch it earlier, but is the in the we had used the term written. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think we meant to change that to print printed because you know it right currently on line 17 to page 16 it says copies of written or electronic \nSPEAKER_04:  contacts and I think we were a electronic contract. Contact is also written, so I think we meant to say print it. \nSPEAKER_00:  That is a simple correction that I can make. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we can make that change on the floor. I apologize for not making that change. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  but it doesn't change the substance of what you're trying to adopt, so we don't need to bring the resolution back. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I have a couple more things I want to bring up as I think I did in. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a couple more things that I want to bring up, similar to what I've done in previous discussions on this, examples of situations that I think could come up, and in this case, have come up in the last couple of weeks that I think we need to think about how they would fit into this policy as it's currently worded. And maybe the, forgive me if some of these have been covered before I don't think they have exactly, and maybe the subcommittee when they were working on it thought about these things. But just for example, I think that's a great question. \nSPEAKER_01:  shortly after the City Council agenda was posted. \nSPEAKER_01:  I got a phone call from a reporter who wanted me to talk about and give a reaction to the code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  So I notified \nSPEAKER_01:  the chair and staff that this had happened and we \nSPEAKER_01:  We worked through it and I said at the time, I think this might be required for me to disclose it. And I assume the reporter is being paid by his employer for calling me. \nSPEAKER_01:  But it made me think about whether that was a good thing or a bad thing and whether \nSPEAKER_01:  and how we want this policy to affect \nSPEAKER_01:  or our conduct or conduct of others, including the press in terms of \nSPEAKER_01:  relating to our \nSPEAKER_01:  the work of our commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can tell you from experience on other commissions. \nSPEAKER_01:  This has never been the case here, but if we had a controversial item in front of us, it is possible. This was, my experience was pre-COVID, but it is possible that there would be reporters in the audience. And as we came out of the meeting, they would approach and they would want our comments and say we had voted four to three. They would want us to say something. And so I think we need as a group to talk about how we would handle this. \nSPEAKER_01:  first just because it may happen because some of the things we get into as we go through our work plan could be somewhat controversial may not agree on them all. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then the other thing is how it relates to this policy. And if we want to think about that in connection with this policy before we... \nSPEAKER_01:  Adapted. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's one example. The other example. \nSPEAKER_01:  is \nSPEAKER_01:  in there. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not sure how to put this in the subcommittee work that we're doing on lab being. \nSPEAKER_01:  We received a suggestion. \nSPEAKER_01:  that perhaps \nSPEAKER_01:  We should try out some of our ideas on members of the City Council before we suggested them. \nSPEAKER_01:  to get their temperature. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  that's a process. \nSPEAKER_01:  that I am familiar with in other contexts because a \nSPEAKER_01:  commission \nSPEAKER_01:  You know. \nSPEAKER_01:  people working in other capacities in the city may want to make sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  people in the city know what their department is thinking about doing in the future. So they have those kinds of conversations to see what problems people see with that. So under this, under this. \nSPEAKER_01:  under the way this is worded. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those conversations I do not believe would be excluded from reporting. They're not about budgetary items and they're certainly going to be about items that would come. \nSPEAKER_01:  that would be probably coming before the ethics commission for discussion. So is it our \nSPEAKER_01:  intention to report those and if it is then \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we have to realize that that then will affect \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  the ability of the commission to get \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm just going to say early information about how some of the things they're thinking about might be received by the electives that have to approve them. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think those are significant communication issues about how our work goes forward that we just need to think through as we, as we, \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, if we adapt this, I think the other examples I had brought up for more what I will call \nSPEAKER_01:  social interactions and interactions with members of the community where we have to make it clear that if they talk to us about what they think about something and it's something that we think the commission would fall within the commission's jurisdiction that then their communication with us will probably get get reported and my understanding was that that was something that the subcommittee intended for for us to do. But I wanted to bring up these other two examples of things that have come up or come to my attention just in the last couple weeks that I think are real, are real possibilities as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to look to Commissioner Fadler and Commissioner Chotwell who were on this ad hoc committee. Yeah. To discuss if that was something. I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm happy to respond. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's my position first. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  the policy just will take \nSPEAKER_03:  both of your hypotheticals. \nSPEAKER_03:  in turn. \nSPEAKER_03:  Similar hypotheticals were discussed by the subcommittee. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  from listening to your description of these two scenarios. \nSPEAKER_03:  My short answer is yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  The longer answer, short answer is yes, they would be contemplated. \nSPEAKER_03:  for disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  by the policy, but let me add a little \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  a bit more of our thinking behind. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, our reasoning. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  I think \nSPEAKER_03:  I think I'm picking up on a theme that there's a \nSPEAKER_03:  concern that \nSPEAKER_03:  any in all communications or you know a large \nSPEAKER_03:  subset of communications with anybody. \nSPEAKER_03:  that we are suddenly bound to \nSPEAKER_03:  disclosed. \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every subjective side. \nSPEAKER_03:  shared by \nSPEAKER_03:  the person with whom we're speaking. So if I run into somebody at a grocery store or to use \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise's examples. \nSPEAKER_03:  social interactions. \nSPEAKER_03:  and somebody says \nSPEAKER_03:  I think they they they oh pine on something that would come within. \nSPEAKER_03:  the purview of our commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't necessarily think. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  the format of disclosure that we put in this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  requires us to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every subjective \nSPEAKER_03:  thought or opinion shared. \nSPEAKER_03:  by the person we spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm looking at page 16. \nSPEAKER_03:  of the handout that \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, that's it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Taylor circulated. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's subsection B titled Format of Disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have to disclose the name of the group or the individual. \nSPEAKER_03:  When it happened and I'll skip over three and four for a second and then number five. \nSPEAKER_03:  If the person was compensated for the communication so three and four subject matter. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  for short description of any oral context. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is \nSPEAKER_03:  purposely a little bit vague. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  in the spirit of trying to move. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  We understand that this is going to be \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  somewhat dependent on the subjective \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of uh... \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, \nSPEAKER_03:  going to be dependent on the person making the disclosure to sort of \nSPEAKER_03:  determine what qualifies as disclosing the subject matter of the communication and the short description of any oral context. \nSPEAKER_03:  I shared in the subcommittee and I think \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  idea was in in putting forward this policy as written to the whole commission that \nSPEAKER_03:  dead. \nSPEAKER_03:  Subsection three and subsection four do not necessarily require us. \nSPEAKER_03:  to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  that say I ran into somebody at a party. \nSPEAKER_03:  That person said they hate this, they hate that, they wish we did this. \nSPEAKER_03:  differently the city should make these five changes. \nSPEAKER_03:  et cetera. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  We would chill. \nSPEAKER_03:  that person's ability to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  those thoughts if we then just \nSPEAKER_03:  turn around and disclose it verbatim. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that's what this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  contemplates. I think this policy contemplates. \nSPEAKER_03:  something to be effective. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm at a party. \nSPEAKER_03:  ran into Joe Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Joe Smith and I discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know. \nSPEAKER_03:  with a very sort of factual objective description we discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, certain. \nSPEAKER_03:  while being \nSPEAKER_03:  lobbying policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  discuss and maybe you describe those policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  without necessarily describing \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every \nSPEAKER_03:  um, thought or opinion that that person attached. \nSPEAKER_03:  two \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  the subject matter of the context. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  To the extent there's this larger concern about social context. \nSPEAKER_03:  being, you know, \nSPEAKER_03:  people are never going to speak to us about their concerns if they know. \nSPEAKER_03:  that \nSPEAKER_03:  we have to disclose it publicly. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think there is some leeway. \nSPEAKER_03:  to just \nSPEAKER_03:  identify who you spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what you generally spoke about. \nSPEAKER_03:  without having to \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of take any further steps. I think this is simply about disclosing baseline facts. \nSPEAKER_03:  about who went where. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So that \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  soon. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's my first response as to the kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  social contact type of medical that has come up a few times. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  with that said. \nSPEAKER_03:  The second hypothetical did. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise talked about. \nSPEAKER_03:  the suggestion to float certain ideas to a city council person. \nSPEAKER_03:  Same thing applies. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, I think this policy would like \nSPEAKER_03:  to advance. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency in the way that we would \nSPEAKER_03:  in a sense that we would disclose. \nSPEAKER_03:  who you spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  when \nSPEAKER_03:  on what topics. \nSPEAKER_03:  but if that city council person wants the freedom to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  their subjective thoughts on certain policies or ideas that you float to them. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think necessarily that this policy requires YouTube. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just, you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Layout in full. \nSPEAKER_03:  that person's \nSPEAKER_03:  subjective thinking. \nSPEAKER_03:  on those items. It's simply disclosing to the public that I met with \nSPEAKER_03:  Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman \nSPEAKER_03:  Snid. \nSPEAKER_03:  on this day and we spoke about \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, a couple of the \nSPEAKER_03:  ideas, you know, one idea, two idea, three. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think you then need to say Councilman. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442, conspicu \nSPEAKER_03:  thought idea one was terrible. \nSPEAKER_03:  thought idea too was great. \nSPEAKER_03:  It, it, it, etc. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Last thing I'll say is the first hypothetical about the \nSPEAKER_03:  phone call from reporter. \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  Looking at Taylor's handout, sub-subsection D, communications where no disclosure is required. \nSPEAKER_03:  on page 16 going into page 17. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Here's a \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of subsection two. \nSPEAKER_03:  Basically, the gist of that is \nSPEAKER_03:  If a contact is not made, \nSPEAKER_03:  the purpose of influencing the decision-making authority of the Commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  you do not need to disclose it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if a reporter calls you and says, \nSPEAKER_03:  comment on something that just came before the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think. \nSPEAKER_03:  that that reporter is contacting you with the purpose of influencing your decision making. \nSPEAKER_03:  the way that we \nSPEAKER_03:  think about somebody who might want to come to us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  actually \nSPEAKER_03:  advance a certain agenda. \nSPEAKER_03:  that then we could. \nSPEAKER_03:  without disclosing to the public. \nSPEAKER_03:  That may influence our vote on a certain agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that the \nSPEAKER_03:  reporter scenario. \nSPEAKER_03:  that Commissioner Wise outlined. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know runs into that issue. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  Whichever subsection D. \nSPEAKER_03:  subsection two of subsection D. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a contact that I think is squarely. \nSPEAKER_03:  outside the \nSPEAKER_03:  the scope of the policy. So those are my thoughts quickly without organizing them. I'm sorry for for taking up time. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know Commissioner Shaw will probably have some thoughts. I'm happy to answer other questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  No need to apologize, Commissioner Feetler, that was very comprehensive and I appreciate your thought process. \nSPEAKER_07:  Let me show you a shot. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I would agree and I think that Commissioner Feele will summarize it very well. \nSPEAKER_04:  I was just going to add that the same concept with regard to the reporter is on kind of the preamble to this particular section. So on page 15 line 25, it's where we're getting across the point. Is this information that we're receiving from an individual in the public or someone as opposed to information that they are providing to us? I do think Commissioner Weiss did raise a concern when she was raising the concern she raised caused me to think just of, I'm always concerned about this. I believe in this policy, I believe in the transparency it provides, but I'm also concerned that anything that would kind of, \nSPEAKER_04:  quiet speech or make people uncomfortable about raising a concern. And one would be, say, an individual in the public approach to member of the ethics commission in a time of say a city election and expressed a concern about a particular candidate. And I think we might need to consider, I can tell you that I think, a member of the member of the public knew that it was going to be made a public record, that their name was going to be associated with a concern that they made about a particular candidate, that they would probably not make the comment, or in some cases they would not make the comment. And I think that is a potential concern that we might want to think about. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Go ahead, Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh oh, you froze. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hopefully we get it back. \nSPEAKER_04:  Hopefully we get it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Do any of the other commissioners have any comments? \nSPEAKER_07:  concerns. \nSPEAKER_07:  Tilt through. \nSPEAKER_07:  is \nSPEAKER_07:  Are you getting commission or feedler back? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I'm seeing it. \nSPEAKER_05:  or the zoom means okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I think the Zoom means okay. So at this time, there's no public comment. So we can move on to the motion vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  at the center. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do we have a motion to approve the recommendation? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I would, I missed your, Commissioner Feedler was going to make a comment and would like to have the benefit of that comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would like to have \nSPEAKER_07:  in that comment. What we can do is go on to the next item. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I hope for the day it gets back. \nSPEAKER_02:  I didn't have the comment to learn. Yeah, okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, okay, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Why don't we wait till we come back with the beat? Okay. So I can take a hit here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we're going to table this item for now. I don't have to do a vote on that, do I, Taylor? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. We're going to go to item number five, recommendation to conduct a study session to discuss the November 12th, 2022 memorandum entitled Notice of Allegations of the City's Ethics Policy. \nSPEAKER_07:  regarding the conduct of certain councilmen. Actually, you know what? I don't think I want to do that one, because I'd rather have Commissioner Fiedler here. Is he back? \nSPEAKER_07:  Whoa, look, I still want enough. That's okay to worry about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm back. That's okay. That's okay. We're in. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's the neck kind of day. Connection. Connection issue. I'm back. \nSPEAKER_07:  next kind of day. Your here. \nSPEAKER_07:  You had a comment that you were going to make before you froze. \nSPEAKER_03:  I did, I'm sorry, that was just wonderful timing, wasn't it? \nSPEAKER_03:  very briefly I think this has come up in a few different contexts that at previous meetings discussions on this issue. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  it. \nSPEAKER_03:  trying to \nSPEAKER_03:  strike a tricky balance here acknowledging that there's no perfect fit. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that the best solution in that situation where somebody comes to you with a concern. \nSPEAKER_03:  and is hesitant to share that concern. \nSPEAKER_03:  to the extent that their name has to be attached to a public disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city has \nSPEAKER_03:  various channels. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  or \nSPEAKER_03:  sharing concerns. \nSPEAKER_03:  whether they're reporting specific violations or allegations of \nSPEAKER_03:  misconduct or just a larger \nSPEAKER_03:  a more opaque general concern with something. \nSPEAKER_03:  for doing so anonymously. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  I would direct that person. \nSPEAKER_03:  to those available reporting channels in that situation if they are so concerned about having their name shared. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  in connection with the comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, again, I don't think that's a reason to abandon or substantially alter this policy. I think that that's the work around and that the rest of the policy is meant to kind of capture more broadly. \nSPEAKER_03:  certain baseline factual information about more contacts than are otherwise disclosed current. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Commissioner Feedler. Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, just two things first. I want to thank Commissioner Feedler for going through each of those and explaining how. \nSPEAKER_01:  how the policy is intended to apply or not apply to them. And it's clear that both Commissioner Feedler and Commissioner Shatwell \nSPEAKER_01:  spent a lot of time in the wording of this and I really, really respect that and I'm grateful for it. The other thing I have to say and this might be, well this is based on experience as I've had to. I do think it is possible for the press to ask questions in a way that feel as though it certainly feel to the receiver as though they are trying to influence the commission. And that would be when they would be speaking to us perhaps about something that is pending that we are going to consider or is going to come back in front of us. And \nSPEAKER_01:  disclosing those since their intent is disclosing those contents doesn't necessarily bother me. But I do think it could be the subject of this perhaps. So I think the point is that there's a line that's difficult to find here. And I think assuming we adopt this now, I hope that in the future that other commissioners that come after us and that perhaps look at this and want to know what it means have the benefit of hearing some of these discussions or some of these examples because I think it might be useful to them as they go through their work. So those are my comments. Thanks. Anyone else? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, and JT there's still no one for public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_07:  Can I have a motion to adopt the... \nSPEAKER_07:  resolution. \nSPEAKER_07:  as amended. \nSPEAKER_07:  As amended. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feedler, can I put you down as the second? \nSPEAKER_03:  You may. I'll second. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so I have a motion by Commissioner Shotwell and a second by Commissioner Fiedler. JT, would you please call the roll? \nSPEAKER_06:  Come and share it already. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. Commissioner DeBenevictus.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  is a presentation by the City Clerk's Office on proposed changes to our website. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi, Chair. This is Heather. I'm actually going to be doing the presentation. So I'm going to ask Eric to pull up the PowerPoint. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Great things there. Can everyone see that? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great. \nSPEAKER_06:  So as a reminder, we're going to walk through our external facing website today. This is what the public sees. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_06:  So currently the ethics page is housed in on the City Clerk's website. So there's two ways to get to the ethics page and that's where those red arrows are pointing. So you can either get through it through the disclosure reports in ethics portal tab or the tab above that says ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  Once you click on the disclosure reports in ethics portal, and actually now the main tab above, it takes you to \nSPEAKER_06:  these six or sorry these nine windows \nSPEAKER_06:  And again, these are on the City Clerk's page. And if you go, if you click on the Ethics Commission button, it takes you \nSPEAKER_06:  to the ethics commission homepage and then each of those buttons takes you to a different place and then you can see on the homepage we have our mission statement. We have an option to go back to the portal if we want to look at other things related to \nSPEAKER_06:  city clerk slash ethics stuff. So if you moving forward, I'm \nSPEAKER_06:  And again, you can also get there through the tab above, which is where the red arrows pointing. \nSPEAKER_06:  So when you click on the about the ethics commission, this is what it looks like. Just gives you a brief history on how the commission came to be. And then it outlines the duties and responsibilities for the commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you click on the commissioners button, we have all of the commissioners headshots posted. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then if you click on the name of each commissioner, it takes you to their bio. \nSPEAKER_06:  Then we also have the Agendas and Minutes page. And then if you click on that link, it just takes you back to our LedgerSpar page where you can look at all of the ethics archives. \nSPEAKER_06:  We also have a commission staff page where we are all \nSPEAKER_06:  We see who is on the commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  staff team and then I am the point of contact for any questions related to ethics. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then we also have our resources page. Hopefully you can see that if not this is all available on the city's web page. And then I just wanted to highlight up to the right that you also have the option to describe to the city's newsletter, which so when the ethics agenda. \nSPEAKER_06:  goes live each month when JT sends that out. That goes out to whomever has signed up on that link. I'll be. \nSPEAKER_06:  Newsletter option. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that's it. So I can go back to any slide you'd like. This is an option for you to... \nSPEAKER_06:  Give any feedback, ask questions. I will tell you that we are \nSPEAKER_06:  working to migrate that ethics page over to the city manager's page. We're meeting with the PIO team hopefully in the next couple of weeks. It won't look terribly different but I'll be the one managing it just taking a little bit off of JT's plate. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Dabin, addictus, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. Thanks Heather. Looks good. \nSPEAKER_06:  together. \nSPEAKER_04:  I guess there's a little part of me. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  always looking beyond and where we go next. I'd like to see when recommendation would be more of you. \nSPEAKER_04:  more of the office and \nSPEAKER_04:  the partnerships wherever we can. I'm not sure if you're permitted to have your own splash page. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it's important that we link to audit to the clerk because there's so many different partnerships on depending on the different \nSPEAKER_04:  where you are in the cycle time, where you are as an employee, and the different transactions that have happened in your career with respect to the ethics \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll just say the ethics office. \nSPEAKER_04:  and showing your face into the face. \nSPEAKER_00:  showing you \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  to the city, I think it's important. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then \nSPEAKER_04:  you know keeping it as user friendly and where the contact and \nSPEAKER_04:  and how to do. But I think it's early days. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so I'm just so glad that you got the real estate on the website. \nSPEAKER_04:  And of course we love the Commission having. \nSPEAKER_04:  Some \nSPEAKER_04:  face time and some presence, but I also see that we are like many other commissions. \nSPEAKER_04:  well, more important, but how you operate, you know, I'd find with even being subordinate. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're having equal. \nSPEAKER_04:  billing with you on on a page for you and the staff. \nSPEAKER_06:  No, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. It looks good. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think there's another handrails, but I can't see that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I fully endorse the Commissioner Dave Benedict. \nSPEAKER_00:  Come on man. \nSPEAKER_00:  I absolutely believe that it would be helpful to \nSPEAKER_00:  really focused. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would actually put more focus on the ethics office and my focus on the ethics division, the ethics division, so over here. \nSPEAKER_00:  that really more focused on the ethics office and what's being done within the city around ethics. \nSPEAKER_00:  and promoting you and you and other resources. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and in that regard. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree with the points that those commissioners just made. \nSPEAKER_02:  but also \nSPEAKER_00:  and also \nSPEAKER_02:  as we get the help line. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh-huh. \nSPEAKER_02:  on board. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's really important to me that as soon as that helpline is up and running. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have something that says, hey, if you have a question about ethics. \nSPEAKER_02:  Here's the number. \nSPEAKER_02:  and put it on multiple pages. \nSPEAKER_02:  within the ethics commission, commission section of the intramet. \nSPEAKER_02:  and also \nSPEAKER_02:  So I know under resources right now we've got a lot of \nSPEAKER_02:  several of the sources of rules. \nSPEAKER_02:  because again, my mind. \nSPEAKER_02:  ethics is both the compliance function, comply with the rules. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then the cultural function. How do I answer this question? \nSPEAKER_02:  and the helpline gets to the \nSPEAKER_02:  cultural \nSPEAKER_02:  aspect of, hey, if you've got a question, \nSPEAKER_02:  Cool. \nSPEAKER_02:  And let's talk it out. But then also to actually talk about the rules somewhere to say, here are the rules, the regulations, the ordinances. \nSPEAKER_02:  so that, you know, I know that the guide has, for example, the conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_02:  rules in it. \nSPEAKER_02:  the FF piece FPPC. \nSPEAKER_02:  Link has a lot of rules and regulations, but it would be good to have an envelope, a link that's called rules rules regulations ordinances. \nSPEAKER_00:  a lot of people. \nSPEAKER_02:  And under that, what the rules are, and then separately. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're touting the hellpline. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the decision-making process for ethical behavior. \nSPEAKER_02:  But I like what you've done so far and I think it's a great \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a great launching pad for \nSPEAKER_02:  a lot of things that we're going to be doing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it's great. I have a technical comment, which I'll just make on the side to. \nSPEAKER_05:  to Heather. But \nSPEAKER_05:  But the other thing I wanted to say is I really do think we have to have the link to the on the fraud hotline on our site. Just as I think we are hoping that the auditor would have links to the ethics. \nSPEAKER_05:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_05:  at the commission on her. \nSPEAKER_05:  on her side and I don't I don't think those are are there yet but um \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think about coming in from the outside. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, if you just put in ethics or fraud or something like that, you try to find a place to talk. \nSPEAKER_05:  We need to make sure that people get there quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's all. \nSPEAKER_05:  but look, it's looking great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's a good catch. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  There are any other comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  JT Still Now Public Common. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, no public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Could I have a motion to receive and file? \nSPEAKER_03:  Lonnie, do you have a question? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  probably more of \nSPEAKER_04:  comment I guess I'm still looking for our own access one day. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we can also. \nSPEAKER_04:  Be able to \nSPEAKER_04:  Can that see the intranet and give me the game? \nSPEAKER_03:  That's coming. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  it's coming. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, thank you. That's my final comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, it'll be presented before the end of the... \nSPEAKER_03:  calendar year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Super. \nSPEAKER_03:  Any other comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, can I have a motion to receive and file the report please? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you all very much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye-bye \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03: 've mentioned anything we had again for a second. \nSPEAKER_03:  JT, you want to call the roll? \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner David Dictus. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Come and share a feed alert. \nSPEAKER_01:  Come here, shall we? \nSPEAKER_03:  Makehle scharbe. \nSPEAKER_01:  I- \nSPEAKER_03:  You're muted. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice-chairpilot. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair Morales."

So we agreed with the executive committee, the chair and vice chair, that we would start bringing the action plan back monthly. So everyone should have received both the action plan and the timetable. I won't go through the whole action plan if there's any specific questions or comments or recommendations you have. Please feel free. I will point out. So on October's timetable we had the ethics program motto on to begin discussion. That was moved completely to November after we posted this. I just wanted to highlight that. And then \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Dibin-Edit says comment. We'll be looking at the intronet. I believe in December. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then we'll be bringing back the ethics program motto for a full discussion in November. So those are just a couple things I wanted to highlight. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then the Suppliers Code draft presentation review. We \nSPEAKER_00:  Originally, I had talked about bringing that back in October, but that's now coming back in November as we discussed last month. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I will open it up to any questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  any questions? What are the questions that also rings to question about a presentation by the auditor on the front outline? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, thank you, Chair. So right now we're aiming for January for that. I have to touch base with the auditor's office because I believe they start compiling all of that information at the end of the year so they may not be ready to give that presentation until February-ish, but I'll have a better answer for you at our next meeting, but that is on our radar. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are there any questions for Heather on the action plan? \nSPEAKER_03:  Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  I had one question, there's blue and there's green. \nSPEAKER_05:  question, there's blue. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does that indicate different people? \nSPEAKER_00:  The blue indicates the capstone recommendation and the green is specific updates or actions that have come from staff. \nSPEAKER_00:  Lily, let me, there's a little... \nSPEAKER_05:  There's a little... \nSPEAKER_00:  cheat sheet at the bottom of the memo. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  No, that's okay. There's a lot of information on here. \nSPEAKER_03:  mit den Menschen in den landmark. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I had a couple of comments. So thank you very much. I very much appreciate it. I think it's very helpful and I kind of keep it since we continue to manage it and it's we're moving along. \nSPEAKER_02:  One question is the timeline priority. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't believe I did not go back and check. \nSPEAKER_02:  the timeline that you provided at the end, which was by \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye, mine. \nSPEAKER_02:  but we didn't change any of the timeline priorities. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  third column in the action plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  And many of those days, if I remember correctly, we're looking at it or actually already gone. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any effort or can there be an effort to adjust those timeline priorities? \nSPEAKER_02:  In terms of obviously I think the commission would probably need to approve it. \nSPEAKER_02:  but as to what's feasible and when things will be done. \nSPEAKER_02:  incorrectly if I'm wrong but I think that there are certain walks or certain lines where \nSPEAKER_02:  We are not likely to achieve the \nSPEAKER_02:  That's a good timeline, probably if they. \nSPEAKER_02:  Q1 is to go year 2023, which if I'm even grammar correctly, I take that as you're all raking. \nSPEAKER_02:  We may have already completed that, that even though it's 2023, we may have already completed that. So, uh, few months, 2023 from a fiscal year standpoint. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does that make sense? \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Chau, I don't know if I'm supposed to answer that, but I agree with you and going over and I feel like this is a living document that we should be able to update the timeline priority. Of course, that's up to the commission and as I was going through this, I noticed I agree with you. I caught. Yeah, you know, we've either. \nSPEAKER_00:  pass that timeline already or we're getting close and there's just no way. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I would think that. \nSPEAKER_00:  That would be an easy \nSPEAKER_00:  thing to do, but I will defer to the chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  So head back. \nSPEAKER_03:  Heather, maybe for the next meeting, you can, those where we've exceeded the timeline, maybe you could make a proposal. \nSPEAKER_03:  as to what would be a more realistic. \nSPEAKER_03:  timeline. \nSPEAKER_03:  or we can talk about it at the agenda setting meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  That sounds great. We're going to have to gather along with the vice chair and her parking lot and things that need to. \nSPEAKER_03:  Get moved in. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think that's a great idea. We'll add that to the agenda. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I would like to say ultimately the new priorities is something that we as a full commission have the opportunity to do. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll be hearing both on. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, we would bring it back. \nSPEAKER_03:  next month and rather than just being a receiving file. \nSPEAKER_03:  it would be an action to update. \nSPEAKER_03:  the action plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  The other thing. \nSPEAKER_03:  And if you don't like the dates, we can always change them in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  The other couple things I noticed is going through it is \nSPEAKER_02:  I think they're in some cases where I think staff believes that \nSPEAKER_02:  We the matter has been closed because it's been a presentation to the Commission on it. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm not certain we as a commission are with agreement that you know. \nSPEAKER_02:  This merely would step presented wasn't necessarily meeting the elements. \nSPEAKER_02:  setup \nSPEAKER_02:  of the action plan, it was the first step in the education process. \nSPEAKER_02:  but that there's more work. \nSPEAKER_02:  to be done because we might have, we might want to influence or suggest changes to what's currently being done and processes are currently being done. \nSPEAKER_02:  And it may not be possible to do that instantaneous in a meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're having a steady session. \nSPEAKER_02:  and getting a presentation on a process. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, might have to come after that meaning is that we take that information and we study that information. \nSPEAKER_03:  So can I make another suggestion in because we're going to bring it back for it's going to come back every month. \nSPEAKER_03:  But next month we're definitely going to be looking at making updates and \nSPEAKER_03:  clarifying some things. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if there are things that you can see on the document where we had reports but we knew that we wanted to put together a work group down the road after we taken \nSPEAKER_03:  care of some other things. \nSPEAKER_03:  If it's something you know needs to come back for further study, can you highlight that and just send it to Heather. \nSPEAKER_03:  Stay before the 26th of October. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that way she and the vice chair can incorporate that in the video. \nSPEAKER_03:  that I find on mom. \nSPEAKER_03:  the evolving document that comes next month for us to look at. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll do. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will do that. I imagine that can open. \nSPEAKER_03:  That was it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Absolutely, that was open to everybody. \nSPEAKER_02:  The last comment I have, I'll make, I'll provide this, when I provide that feedback to, is on 5.3, the annultrification of compliance. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Here, the Green Tax says, the recommended code of conduct and ethics language will or a staff to acknowledge the sheet of the code as well as complete a 30-minute training. \nSPEAKER_02:  which I appreciate that is the level one of any certification, but what I was anticipating when we developed the action plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  was a little bit farther where it was actually asking \nSPEAKER_00:  We are going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to \nSPEAKER_02:  all applicable and boring. \nSPEAKER_02:  It was a 12 month look back and you might have 10, 5 to 15 questions on particular topic. And then they would look back and say, in the last 12 months, I have not done at \nSPEAKER_02:  that has not already been. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  We love you \nSPEAKER_02:  I have not already notified the city auditor, the F exhibition or appropriate. And so in terms of the certification, \nSPEAKER_02:  That is more what I was the annual certification of compliance. You know, when I was participating in the developing of the draft of say action plan I was thinking it wasn't merely just an acknowledgement that I've read and received the code. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think we might have. \nSPEAKER_03:  because that... \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I hear what you're saying. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I don't remember us ever having discussed as a group doing that. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I don't really... \nSPEAKER_03:  And I don't believe that that was something that was \nSPEAKER_03:  covered in the meat and converse with the unions. \nSPEAKER_02:  This would be on the... \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree with that in your very good point that it would have to be. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh \nSPEAKER_02:  being conferred on and that would be something to, and that might have been a miss for me not having mentioned that sooner. \nSPEAKER_02:  and given that \nSPEAKER_02:  percentage of employees within the city that are represented that could have an impact, but it is something I still think that we need to talk about so that it be considered at the next appropriate time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Vice Chair, I think we need to add that to the parking lot. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  and I was wondering maybe \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  in the next two weeks. \nSPEAKER_05:  before the agenda or the next few weeks, before the agenda setting meeting, I think it's in two weeks. \nSPEAKER_05:  Maybe I could have a couple of phone calls with Heather. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  and talk through. \nSPEAKER_05:  timeline priority changes. \nSPEAKER_05:  and other things that might be contemplated within some of the items here. \nSPEAKER_05:  and I did want to confirm this was intended to be a living document. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so what we are talking about right now is wholly consistent with \nSPEAKER_05:  The concept of the action plan that would continue to evolve. \nSPEAKER_05:  each evolution would require. \nSPEAKER_05:  further discussion with the whole commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  but I'll put it in the parking lot too. \nSPEAKER_05:  address specifically 5.3. \nSPEAKER_05:  but also we should \nSPEAKER_05:  the entire commission should look through this and decide other \nSPEAKER_05:  items that we ought to talk about. \nSPEAKER_05:  But it will end time. \nSPEAKER_05:  at the agenda setting meeting, potentially. \nSPEAKER_05:  I will be able to propose a proposed new \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  timeline priorities. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we can present to the group. \nSPEAKER_05:  as a first step. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  If there are any other comments on the action plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  I sure did you have another comment you can. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, no, I'm sorry. I was just writing notes. That's good. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do we have any public to comment? \nSPEAKER_01:  No, we... Oh, actually? Let's see. \nSPEAKER_01:  At this time, if you'd like to speak in the Zoom meeting, please use the Race Hand feature. \nSPEAKER_01:  Seeing none, that concludes well the comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I have a motion to receive and file the update on the action plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  Michelle de Venetik, this moves to receive and file the action plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. It's been a short while, second step. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can you take in your call to question please? \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_00:  on. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  consider shouts? \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice Chair Paula. \nSPEAKER_03:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair Morales."

I'm doing a lot of talking today. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, so they've already talked. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_03:  I said I hope you have water with you. I do a lot. So we've already talked about the revised code of conduct that's coming to City Council on November 1st. Julie and I will be doing a quick presentation as well. Just looking at the history of how we got here and then looking forward what we hope to come. Wanted to lift up that in the end of our survey, we had 46 responses to our new motto and catchphrase. A lot of those were really great. Some of them. \nSPEAKER_03:  weren't helpful at all. But Julian and I can pile a smaller list and then I'll be sitting down with that ad hoc tonight after this meeting. And then we'll present, or that ad hoc will present the slate at November ethics commission meeting. And then we should have our new program motto and catchphrase by December's meeting. So it's very exciting that things are starting to come together. The NABX ethics point help line, that contract is in place. So Julian has more of the specific details of \nSPEAKER_03:  bringing that on board. I know it's an 8 to 12 week. \nSPEAKER_03:  time period between now and then what that looks like. I'm not 100% sure but we hope to launch that in early 2023 and that falls in line right now with our action plan. The education program just a couple highlights or reminders that I'll be doing the Neo training starting this month. To Commissioner Norbe's question last month, can commissioners join in and observe the Neo trainings? Yes, you can. So I will send out that link. I think there's a registration process but yes you're more than welcome to join and observe. I'm also working with Technology and Innovation to put together a code of conduct PSA. \nSPEAKER_00:  you can. \nSPEAKER_03:  So hopefully that can launch once it's approved to finalize codified I should say. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hopefully that's around the same time the PSA is complete. So that will be part of our \nSPEAKER_03:  marketing materials just lifting up the new or the revised code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_03:  promo materials. We did get those ordered. In the end we had some extra money. So we ordered tote bags. I'm going to ask Eric. \nSPEAKER_03:  to pull up. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just wanted to show you really quick what our new tote bags are going to look like. \nSPEAKER_03:  We use the principles of the values statement and a word bubble using our four primary languages that are spoken here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  We were able to order 4100 of these bags to start with. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this is what the bag looks like. It actually folds up into a little strawberry is what I call them \nSPEAKER_03:  But we were on a very quick deadline, so our designer was able to put this together quickly, and we're actually really excited. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this is our bag. And again, it's the principles of the value statement in Kami Tagalog, English, and Spanish. \nSPEAKER_03:  And thanks, Eric. \nSPEAKER_03:  And just wanted to remind the commission that Julian and I are attending the annual SCCE conference next week. So we can do a quick report out on that in November. And that's my report. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  There is questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  for \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I will say that I had hoped you... \nSPEAKER_00:  see Heather at the conference, but I'm not going to be able to make that conference this year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks commissioner, maybe next year. \nSPEAKER_00:  I did have one question. Remind me. \nSPEAKER_00:  How did we come up with the word bubble? I love it, the word bubble. \nSPEAKER_00:  but we're very... \nSPEAKER_00:  Do you have a focus group on that or? \nSPEAKER_03:  It was Julian and I and then the chair and vice chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Julian and I and then the turn back. \nSPEAKER_03:  That was the working group. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, we were on a timeline to expend FY23 dollars. So unfortunately we didn't have time for a lot of input. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I thought we came up with something pretty cool in a short period of time. \nSPEAKER_04:  we came up with. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're hoping to see it out in the community because the staff that live in the community. \nSPEAKER_04:  carrying it and hopefully it can spark some conversations. \nSPEAKER_04:  Any other comments? \nSPEAKER_02:  Question? \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Wands? Just seeing the topic we might have made actually something about the website, which is if there was a way for us to bold our values on the website, on our website, I think that would be great. \nSPEAKER_02:  com or attention to them. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think the bag is really cool. \nSPEAKER_04:  Any other questions or comments? \nSPEAKER_04:  JT, any public comment? \nSPEAKER_01:  At this time we don't have any public on. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can I have a motion to receive and file the ethics officers report? \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Wise moves to us accepted. \nSPEAKER_02:  You see, my fire. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  in your second. \nSPEAKER_04:  J.T. Could you call the role please? \nSPEAKER_01:  Can we share a Norvey? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  I cannot submit to hold to the committee on the 5th point, the third houses of Berkis W \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Feetler. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_01:  I commissioner wise. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice Chair Paula. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair Morales."
