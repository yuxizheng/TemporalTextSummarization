I think that would be helpful to us when we go back over the minutes and I think also it would be good for the public who looks at the minutes to know. \nSPEAKER_01:  to know that? Is that, would that be a problem or JT? Is that \nSPEAKER_03:  Typically, we only add the name of organization if they're part of a presentation that's provided at the request of the council. So we can go back and look into that, if you'd like. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, well I thought it would be helpful to me at least. It would be nice to be able to know who people were with. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I just like to chime in on that that will bring this back to our city clerk to see how we might be able to accommodate and we'll report back on if we can how that would be managed. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. So if it can be managed, can it be done to these, even though we approve the minutes? \nSPEAKER_02:  now. \nSPEAKER_02:  Could we approve the minutes with the request that if available? \nSPEAKER_02:  If it can be accommodated, that those names be added as an amendment to the minutes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, that's right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so I'll make a mo unless there are any other. \nSPEAKER_02:  comments. So then I would request that the motion on the floor be that we approve the minutes as presented with the request that if the City Clerk's office can add the name of the organization a speaker was here representing to the minutes that be done in a minute to the minutes. Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  Can we have a second? Call the roll, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  I forgot we did this."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Our next item is to receive and file a presentation on communication and outreach strategy for the Ethics Commission and program. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thanks, Chair. Eric, will you pull? \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we're just going to briefly go over what we use on the ethics team for outreach and communication and ideas that the commission may want to consider. \nSPEAKER_08:  So just a reminder, on the action plan, we have deliverables 3.4 and 3.5. 3.4 says that we will execute outreach plan to city employees and elected and officials and 3.5 is for the public outreach. We're currently focused on 3.4, but we are, as you know, doing some 3.5 as well. \nSPEAKER_08:  You really can't see that. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I will, can you guys see it from your monitors? Okay. So for the education program and helpline, these are the different tools that we'll be using or are using as the program launches and the helpline launches. And that includes newsletters from different departments, city manager. There's a PIO on most departments that manage newsletters. \nSPEAKER_08:  That will go out various ways through the city. There's internet announcements, tote bag deployment, Julian and I are planning an event. Presentations for directors and administrative officers. \nSPEAKER_08:  put together an announcement template for leadership so they can send it out to their departments, continue communication and presentations with independent departments that's harbor utilities, etc. Start working with other commissions and then as after the program or the training officially launches we'll start reporting and tracking. \nSPEAKER_08:  We're surveys. So that's what we're doing internally. \nSPEAKER_08:  So externally, I think that the commission can use a lot of these tools. \nSPEAKER_08:  We can mark it our help line publicly community meetings, council district newsletters are a good way to reach out to the community. \nSPEAKER_08:  Our neighborhood services bureau, they have several lists serves with different community groups that we can work with them to reach out to the community through. There's different community events that we could always set up a table that would be. \nSPEAKER_08:  be volunteering yourself to \nSPEAKER_08:  I go to some of these events, but on my other commission we did that frequently. Website announcements, of course social, print, electronic media. So these are just different ways that we traditionally reach out to the community. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I just want to remind us that these are high level suggestions and ideas, which of course evolve over time. And you guys are getting the coverage that we're talking about. So the media is paying attention. I think we have a... \nSPEAKER_08:  and Ally and Jason Ruiz, he covers the commission. So we are getting press, which is good. So my recommendation is to use the tools that we \nSPEAKER_08:  include internally and for public communication that we just talked about. And then I just went over those again on this slide. Another thing to consider are working with Long Beach TV. So we could do like 60 second eye clips that would go on Channel 8. Those are really easy to do and don't take a lot of time. Council meeting crawlers, so there's always announcements going across the bottom of council meeting screens that we could. Use. \nSPEAKER_08:  We could also use our own social media accounts. We can't have an account as a commission, but if there's things coming up, you can use your own social media account just to announce that this is going on at the meeting. Of course, we're not swaying public decision just announcing what's coming up at meetings. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then you or we could consider paid advertising on Facebook, Instagram and next store. And what that means is that that just brings any announcements that you're making on your page up to the top. So when people open their social media page, that's the first thing they see. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then I'm also exploring putting like an ethics corner on the internet and the internet just to kind of highlight just different things that are happening currently. \nSPEAKER_08:  with ethics and then just different articles that may be \nSPEAKER_08:  applicable to staff or interesting to staff. So those are things that we're looking at. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then, so also as we're going to these various meetings and check-ins for conversation starters, we ask the department or whomever we're meeting with how they can spotlight ethics in their department, if they're willing to put an ethics statement on their web pages or things that we've talked about with the Chair and Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_08:  And again, the different tools, community meetings, and other events, council check-ins. And then public comment at council meetings can be a good, \nSPEAKER_08:  resource too if someone wanted to come during public comment and announce. \nSPEAKER_08:  something that's going on at the meeting that they'd like public input for. \nSPEAKER_08:  So those are just things to consider and we can... \nSPEAKER_08:  talk a little bit about it. If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them. \nSPEAKER_09:  Does anyone have any? Hold on, let me get back. Oh, bye, it's chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  A couple of questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  I get emails from the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  that have a variety of different topics in them. \nSPEAKER_04:  Are we able to put something in those emails? \nSPEAKER_08:  I mean, like, ask them to add something to their newsletters. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is it a newsletter? I mean, just I think it just \nSPEAKER_08:  I think it just depends on what announcements are coming out of which department. They could be newsletters. They could be. \nSPEAKER_04:  But sometimes it's multiple departments. It'll have something from Park and Rec. It'll have something from economic development, equity and inclusion. \nSPEAKER_08:  So yes, yeah, we could always ask if we could be included in their distributions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the other thing when I saw the mention in your presentation on using our own social media accounts, I went and looked back again at the social media policy. Because I know there's, you know, guidance in there on using our own accounts. And it said we have to archive. \nSPEAKER_04:  In case there's a public records request, maybe Taylor can help. I'm not even sure what that means I would have to do if I use my own, say, Facebook or Instagram to communicate something about a meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  So you are correct if you, there are consequences of using your personal accounts under the Public Records Act and the social media policy. So, um, \nSPEAKER_05:  Basically, if you use your private social media or your email for city business, including this commission, you risk turning that account into basically a public official account where now it's subject to the PRA and potentially subject to the social media policy. That means that \nSPEAKER_05:  the first amendment protections of the people who are participating with you on your social media. \nSPEAKER_05:  Apply, right? Because you are a commissioner. \nSPEAKER_05:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  I would recommend and we recommend to City Council and the commissioners of keeping separate accounts both for email and for social media reasons to keep your personal life personal and any city business that you're doing separate it makes it a lot easier to comply with the PRA and social media policy in doing that. There's no especially for the elected officials there's no conflation of whether or not they're using public resources for personal gain or for campaign-related purposes. \nSPEAKER_05:  But you're correct, you would need to. You couldn't, you maybe couldn't delete posts. It makes them more difficult to block people because they have a first member right to free speech. And the policy addresses those things as well. \nSPEAKER_09:  with the \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  HF2B public. \nSPEAKER_09:  public awesome. \nSPEAKER_09:  Because like my personal Facebook is private and most of my friends are family and they're not going to be interested in what we're doing here. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  So that would be the reason why you would do a separate one. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  But if I open to separate Facebook page in my role as ethics commissioner, I'd get all of you following me. \nSPEAKER_09:  my role. \nSPEAKER_04:  And now we have different issues, right? Under the brown act. So I might not even get all of you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And now we have \nSPEAKER_05:  right? Under the brown ax. So I might not even get all of you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And liking each other's both, that's a whole other thing. Right, so. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let's do it. \nSPEAKER_05:  That may not be the best way, right? It is an option, but like I said, my office typically recommends keeping a separate account if you're going to use social media to promote \nSPEAKER_05:  what you're doing. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's why I'm jumping in here. So that's why, because Parks and Recreation has their own Facebook account, they're able to do ads on Facebook also asking input from people on things. So we wouldn't be able to do that either. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's why I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, that would be a bigger consideration, right? Commissions typically don't have social media accounts. Their messaging is promoted through the city's main pages. And sometimes echoed by the departments, depending on what the commission is. And that's to avoid these issues, right? So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, if it was promoted on the city's social media, the main one I believe. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, that's correct. That's definitely where our communications office prefers. And one of the big benefits to that is that each kind of, you know, in this example, commission or special project in the city doesn't have to kind of garner their own following and group. We already have the main city account where there's thousands of followers and people that are signed up for our communications. So it's kind of we're just tapping into that existing communications stream. So our reach is a lot better going through the main page of the city that way. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think I like that better. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  Commissioner \nSPEAKER_06:  twice. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. First of all, I want to say I really like the questions that you have at the end of the questions that you're asking when you talk to the departments and officers of the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'd be interested in having questions that maybe we should ask if we're approached as an ethics commissioner and talking to people about this. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the two wheels that you have. \nSPEAKER_06:  There's not really a specific timeline associated with those, right? Because it's just a continual, you're just continually doing those things. Correct. Okay. I wondered though, because we're just getting started on this, is there a way to measure our progress, or specifically, I guess, your progress in terms of meeting with the different departments, so we know, \nSPEAKER_06:  And maybe that's embodied in your reports to us each month and I'm not exactly keeping track of it. But you know, we've been, you know, there's this many departments to go to and you've been to 5 out of 20 or, you know, 10 out of 20 so that we kind of know where we are. I think that could be useful to us perhaps. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then there was a comment last month at our meeting that \nSPEAKER_06:  suggesting that we could have done more to get to ask for input about the topics that we were discussing. \nSPEAKER_06:  have we yet could we give to the city council members on a regular basis some little blurb that they could put in there in their newsletters. I mean I get those from several city council people when they talk about what's going on at the city some of them do it weekly whatever. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, I think we can definitely make \nSPEAKER_08:  that request. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, depending on what. \nSPEAKER_08:  depending on what we're asking them to put in the newsletter. \nSPEAKER_06:  Do we have this, I mean, \nSPEAKER_06:  Is our staff have enough time to put together something like that? It just seems like once in a while we should just, I know we do the annual report and things like that. We should give them a heads up that this is what we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, I have that capacity. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, okay. Well, I think that would be a good, a good thing to, to do so that if we want to encourage the public, the public, the public heads up. \nSPEAKER_06:  about what we're talking about and what we're thinking about and invite them to provide comments. I mean we want the comments to come back to you I think as opposed to us directly unless they're going to come to a meeting because otherwise we have to go through that reporting routine and it makes more sense for them to go through through you. But I would like to see something like that develop if we could and if it's I don't know where it fits in with the priorities of what we're doing but I think there's use of it could be made right away. So those are my comments. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Comment your shot well. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a few questions. I very much appreciate the report, Heather. On the email, I presume that it's not possible for us to have city accounts. That's all the email associated with. \nSPEAKER_03:  or ethics commission business goes to that city account. \nSPEAKER_05:  To my knowledge, because commissioners are not employees of the city, they don't receive a city email. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. With regard to your report, Heather. \nSPEAKER_03:  One, I don't have social media, so probably won't be creating that or leveraging that. \nSPEAKER_07:  It was just a very quick idea. We can scratch that completely. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I do. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, no, no, no, no, I do appreciate it. But more seriously is with Gartar, you mentioned an item slide four, but in slide three, you just want to re-impologize if I've raised this and you've addressed it before, but to the extent that you can get one of the seven of us into certain of the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  City employee venues, I think it would be helpful. I think it would be helpful for us to really kind of understand the kind of some of the comments and concerns and us engaging. And I think it might be helpful in terms of getting that message out to really leverage the commission in those city meetings. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you clarify what you mean by city meetings? \nSPEAKER_03:  So yeah, thank you. So if you're meeting with a group of employees or you're invited to an entire organization within the city, or you're meeting with, say, a director within the city, things on that line, I'm primarily focusing though when you're meeting with larger groups of employees. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, and then what was, what is the, is it like a standard message? Just like, oh, this is what the ethics commission is or \nSPEAKER_02:  I think it would vary. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it would vary with what the ethics office would like and what in I think there's different types of messages that the ethics office can really kind of be pushing out there. Sometimes targeted for a particular organization based on the risk associated with that particular organization because the risk of vary depending on the nature of their operations. But then also, you know, just there's a variety of ways and needs to communicate. Heather's done a great job kind of outlining the ones that you're using. It's just a way that I, it's an additional way into the, to the extent you're not already doing it. I think you are doing some of it is a, it's another way to kind of get the message out to the, basically, the city of Long Beach team. And I think there's a benefit to also kind of bringing in ethics commission members not to lead those discussions but to be part of those discussions and to take part into, you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  be kind of talk about some of the issues, but having, you know, Heather or others kind of take the lead in the meeting itself. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for the follow up question. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's all I have. \nSPEAKER_09:  Commissioner Anorvay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you Heather for the report. Appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_00:  I agree with Commissioner Weiss. I really like the conversation starters. It's a great way when you first meet someone at a meeting or a casual gathering. \nSPEAKER_00:  to ask those type of questions. \nSPEAKER_00:  I also really like the ethics corner idea. \nSPEAKER_00:  RITA at City of LA is constantly signing us emails with a quick short question. \nSPEAKER_00:  and they're very to the point and they're very quick and it kind of always leaves a reminder in my head to not click on this or not click on that so I think those can be very effective. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  in terms of \nSPEAKER_00:  your \nSPEAKER_00:  3.5 public communications and outreach strategy. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for putting this together. \nSPEAKER_00:  I may have, I apologize if I may have misunderstood our discussion January or February. \nSPEAKER_00:  where someone mentioned that we don't have access to \nSPEAKER_00:  the nonprofits in the city or that getting a newsletter would be difficult. \nSPEAKER_00:  when I receive this. So I'm glad that. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's cleared up so it was probably my fault that I missed that I missed heard that. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I had added, for example, the Long Beach Office of Equity had its own e-news letter. \nSPEAKER_00:  and not only does that \nSPEAKER_00:  newsletter, highlight events, but it also includes the Human Relations Commission meeting, time and date, etc. I think we can do something very similar. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach Development Services sends out an email public notices, which includes the Planning Commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  meeting date, meeting time, etc. \nSPEAKER_00:  neighborhood resource center. \nSPEAKER_00:  I went out and I used to sit on a non-profit board. \nSPEAKER_00:  We used to work with Margaret Madden, and she would send out monthly newsletters that would include \nSPEAKER_00:  events in the community. I don't know if we can reach out to her if she's still with the city, but maybe like you mentioned \nSPEAKER_00:  there are neighborhood. \nSPEAKER_00:  in newsletters that go out. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  and to follow up on Commissioner Schottwell, I had asked \nSPEAKER_00:  I think. \nSPEAKER_00:  October, November. \nSPEAKER_00:  if we were \nSPEAKER_00:  allowed to attend a new employee training. \nSPEAKER_00:  and to be there for your presentation. \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe that was okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  When will the next employee, new employee training be so that perhaps one of us can sit through it? \nSPEAKER_00:  Not to criticize you or anything like that just to see if maybe we can give you some feedback \nSPEAKER_08:  Sure, yeah, but they're monthly. I think the first Tuesday might be the last. I think it's the last Tuesday of every month. And if you, whoever wants to join, just let me know and I'll send you the link. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, it just might be interesting just to see one the orientation and also your presentation and how it's received by the employees. \nSPEAKER_08:  and also you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, it's a four hour \nSPEAKER_09:  Re-commissioners to respond to your message would be the ones to attend. No more than that. \nSPEAKER_09:  So, but thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, you bet. \nSPEAKER_09:  Is there anyone else? \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you for the presentation. I think as we continue going through our agenda items, communication is obviously something that we need to keep foremost and forefront in our minds. And even as we set up new committees, maybe think about what we want to do in terms of outreach before the committee really starts working in terms of asking the community what they think or the most important issues for us to address. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, can I have a motion to receive and file the report? \nSPEAKER_09:  to move by Commissioner Norvey, seconded by Commissioner DeBinnidictus. Please call the vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair, did you want to take public comment? \nSPEAKER_09:  Oh, thank you. Is there any public comment on this item?"

Next item up is a recommendation to receive and file the Ethics Commission 2022 annual report. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh wait, no, I'm skipping the City officials employees. So let's go back to number three. Discussion on the ethics guide for City officials and employees and suggested next steps to update the guide. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I had asked the staff to, we talked for a while about looking at what is provided to the staff and I'd asked the staff to kind of take a stab at it in response to some comments I'd gotten from a couple of you that there are some things that it would be nice to have the staff work on first and then have us come back and look at. So that's what happened with this item. Hopefully you each had a chance to look at what. \nSPEAKER_02:  was put together and then we can go from here. \nSPEAKER_00:  In my would for you at least, co \uc544\ub2c8\uba74, if there are Korean sportsmen at some patrol station or sports clubs come and \nSPEAKER_02:  You didn't do it in my way ahead of us. \nSPEAKER_00:  a bit. What we're looking for for this item is some direction from the commission to send us to review it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, shit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, so let me back up then. A couple of you after our, I thought we went ahead and did that. Okay, so after our retreat, you have to. \nSPEAKER_03:  You have to vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  vote on it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  So after I retreat, a couple of people commented that they thought it would be nice if there were some things that the staff just went ahead and took a stab at. And then came back to us and then we could help the massage it a little bit rather than having us take it from the get go. And I was thinking that this would be a good item for the staff to take first draft at and then we could look at possibly putting, we could either do it as a group or we could put together a small work group to look at it. So if you're so amenable, what I'm requesting is that we make a motion that we request the staff to go in and do revisions and first draft updates to the ethics guide for city officials and employees and bring it back for our consideration. \nSPEAKER_02:  Go ahead. It's our commission chowel, sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So I imagine staff would already be doing this, but in the process, if we do approve this item, to do some also benchmark and to see what other ethics guides other cities have and compare and contrast because there may be things in those ethics guides that we want to incorporate. I imagine you would already do it, but just suggest again. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  I assume. \nSPEAKER_05:  Heather. \nSPEAKER_05:  that \nSPEAKER_05:  when staff goes through this. \nSPEAKER_05:  certain things will be automatically changed. \nSPEAKER_05:  For example, \nSPEAKER_05:  It'll be updated from January 2020. \nSPEAKER_05:  to whatever month in 2023. \nSPEAKER_05:  and Mr. Parkin's name will be replaced. \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  right? \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. And then also the pagination is off. \nSPEAKER_05:  under the table of contents. So for example, conflicts of interest is not page 8. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's page 11. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, it's good. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's going to come with facelift. Okay. Yeah. We're not going to just tweak it here and there. It will be completely different. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  That's gonna come to me. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  I wasn't sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  I wasn't sure the scope of what you were gonna do when \nSPEAKER_04:  Got it. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  brand new. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's it for now, John. \nSPEAKER_03:  Chair, can we get a second on your motion before we keep the discussion going? \nSPEAKER_02:  Somebody like to second. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, now we have a second. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any... \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner, you were completed. Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Chair. I had gone ahead and made a few notes, just general things that I thought needed to be rethought or re-done. So I would just provide those to you guys, or I'm not going to go through them here. \nSPEAKER_03:  So what we would prefer is for you guys to vote and agree on whatever notes that you would like us to consider before we go back so that the entire commissions on the same page about what staff has been asked to do. So I just would ask that we either amend the motion or include that in the motion the commission adopts that way one commissioner is directing what staff is doing. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, let me just, it's coming on that idea. I can tell you what my thoughts are right now, or we could amend the motion and just invite the commissioners to do what I was suggesting I would do, which is submit my comments to you. But that's not what I'm saying. \nSPEAKER_02:  But that's not what we were discussing Susan. That's what we would do down the road. So if you have specific things that you want to see that they address. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  or if you want to wait and see if they address them when they get, because they probably will go ahead and address a lot. We know that this document has to go through a wholesale rework. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  But if you want to go through what your comments were, we can amend them in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, I will refrain from doing that. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can we make sure shot will? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Sorry again, this is just a minor thing, but what Commissioner Norway mentioned, it just triggered. I think when we ultimately approve the ethics guide, I imagine the ethics guide has to come back to the Commission for approval each and every time. I would like to incorporate into that approval if there's a possibility of just making administrative staffing, staff having. \nSPEAKER_01:  Authority to make administrative changes like if a telephone number change to go and make the telephone number change or Like when we have a new city attorney to change the city attorney out just things that we can do without bringing it back to the commission when it's kind of just more administrative in nature So I just want to put it out there for consideration when it does come back \nSPEAKER_03:  So the commission wouldn't have ultimate authority to approve or deny the document. You have an opportunity to provide feedback. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, and that would address my concern. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you mention the depending on the class? Did you change your mind? \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll just join my efforts to continue to provide comment later. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any other comments? Is there any public comment on this item? Okay. Seeing none, can we call the vote please?"

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  have a recommendation to receive and file a monthly update from the ethics officer. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we are currently building out the helpline, which is exciting. We're working with NavX and looking at a June launch for that. So we're going to launch the Code of Conduct training at the same time. Those will be launched together. Still working with LBTV to finalize the Code of Conduct video, but that's coming along nicely. Also, when it's let you know that we've established a general ethics email. So as. \nSPEAKER_03:  And it's for the public, but as the commissioners are referring members of the public to me, that email is ethics at LongBeach.gov and it still comes directly to me. It's just easier. \nSPEAKER_03:  for all of us to spell, then my last name, and remember. So again, that's ethics at LongBeach.gov. \nSPEAKER_03:  Last night we had the first reading of our updated ordinance that amends the city's salary resolution. I don't know if you've been following that in the press but this will allow for certain members of advisory bodies to serve as volunteers. \nSPEAKER_03:  This meant this ordinance also includes mandatory training module that includes code of conduct training and attestation and The city clerk is currently working with the city attorney's office on building that module. So that's exciting \nSPEAKER_03:  A few of us from the ethics team met recently with the executive director of the LA ethics commission just to discuss their efforts in updating LA's lobby ordinance. I'll be sharing that information with the lobbying ad hoc, but just wanted the commission to know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Form 700. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this year we had 877 filings total filed was 862. We have 15 still not filed but all city staff has filed so that's good. So we're at about a 98% completion rate right now. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll be attending the ECI Impact Conference the first week of May and then just wanted to confirm with the commission that the mayor's team will come becoming to the May ethics commission meeting so we will have. \nSPEAKER_03:  the mayor's office visit. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  And that's my report. So to kind of tag on to Heather's report, the mayor had a meeting with the chairs of all of the commissions while I was sick. I was unable to attend. But his chief of staff has been sending out subsequent emails and made a request that he be advised of agendas where we thought he might be interested in attending one of our meetings. And I invited him to attend our main meeting, thinking that it might be a little more active. The one thing that I do know from the meeting that the mayor had with the chairs is that he has requested that all commissioners take a moment to go and read the city's strategic plan. So if you haven't already taken the moment to read the city's strategic plan, please make sure you're familiar with that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Chair, can we get a copy of that so that we're all on the same page of what that plan is? \nSPEAKER_03:  Ja, ogs\u00e5 en n\u00e6ra. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I didn't want another thing chair before I wrap up. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I did meet with the water department yesterday, so that I'm visit. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm just taking a break and that was just a program introduction to the managers. April was with an open. \nSPEAKER_00:  taking place about. \nSPEAKER_03:  Utilities Department. \nSPEAKER_00:  Are you borrowing the medicines? \nSPEAKER_03:  I even confirmed it this week to make sure, but it's still stuck in my brain. So the utilities department. \nSPEAKER_03:  that meeting happened yesterday with all the managers. And again, that was just an introduction to the program to let them know that the code of conduct training was coming up and other resources that were. \nSPEAKER_03:  coming together and that's the end of my report. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a question on the 15 individuals who didn't file the form 700. I presume that those are commissioners then since all city staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  file theirs and I'm presuming that the city clerk's office or somebody is working to get those. But isn is are they not allowed to attend their meetings if they haven't filed that was do I remember that being someplace that \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I'm not sure about if they're not able to 10 meetings, but I can look into that. So right now, yet the period for the late filers is still ongoing, so we're still reaching out to them to try to track them down to get them the file. And then we'll have to eventually, for the non-compliant filers, we'll submit that list to the FEPC. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then to add to what AT said, the ordinance, actually, that Heather pointed out to you at the beginning of her report. One of the changes that was made was to make advisory city council, created commissions consistent with the charter in the way the commissioners remove. So not filing your form 700 is a basis. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, maybe that's where I saw it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Maybe that's where I saw it. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I believe that that's what you're thinking of, but it can be for any reason. That would be a reason to remove because an enforcement action could come from the FPPC for not filing your form 700. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Mayor does have a call out for applications for all commissions, so that will be timely that if need be he will have a pool of qualified candidates. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  and they have a... \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can you give an update on that note just so you know? \nSPEAKER_00:  The non charter appointments will be going to Council Plan for the 18th. And so as of Friday afternoon, you'll see that list of proposed commissioners on legislature. \nSPEAKER_00:  There's a placeholder there now and man for charter \nSPEAKER_00:  It has to go to a committee. The committee has to approve and then refer back to the council and then the council will \nSPEAKER_00:  approved so that will be following and that's just an update because you'll see that coming before we meet next. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you very much, Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you chair and Heather, thank you for this report. Sounds like a lot of good things coming up. I believe you said that you would be sharing your thoughts with the lobbying ad hoc, your thoughts from the meeting you had with certain members of the LA ethics commission, is that right? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, not my thoughts, just we were curious about how they did community engagement. So we were going to, I was just going to let them know. \nSPEAKER_05:  I see. Okay. I would be curious in the one not a member of the ad hoc itself. Is it possible for the rest of the commission to review whatever information you share with that ad hoc as well or either from you directly or from the ad hoc. I would just request the \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we can do that next month in women's absence. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's fine. I just wanted to air the request and express interest in hearing more about that meeting. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Feederler's question was along the lines of what I was interested in. First, you met with members of the city of LA Ethics Commission staff, correct? Okay. And the \nSPEAKER_06:  It was focused on lobbying and community outreach associated with lobbying. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. Were you able to, were there any other areas that you were able to explore with them that you would be able to share or I imagine, you know, at some point in time in the future you can have a broader discussion with them about their operations. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure, yeah, I mean we did talk about more than just community engagement. They've done this three times now, brought lobbyists, recommendations. So they've been doing this a long time. So yes, absolutely. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think we can bring that back. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I'm extremely pleased that you're attending the ECI Impact Conference. I think that's going to be well worth your time. It's a very solid organization. I'm very well respected. So enjoy New Jersey. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there any public comment on this item next? \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. Can I have a motion to adopt or to receive a file report? \nSPEAKER_04:  It's been moved by Commissioner Feedler, seconded by Commissioner Weiss."

Discuss anticipated ad hoc committees for coming projects and if appropriate take action to dissolve or create ad hoc committees. We'll have the report from the lobbying ad hoc first. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I'm going to give the report and the other members of the committee, the chair and vice chair can supplement and revise it. We've met twice. We also had a phone meeting with staff and we're going to be meeting with them again as you just heard to get some additional information both about what is going on in Los Angeles, which is in the process right now of amending. It's, or considering amending, it's ordinance on the same topic and also we're talking to staff about how the recommendations in our report that has been drafted so far would affect them and what their thoughts are about them. We expect we will be revising the recommendations, taking into account all of this additional information and all of the input that we've received from the public, both in messages and emails at the meeting last month. It's anticipated that the business improvement districts probably will not be the exemption as to them. \nSPEAKER_01:  We won't be recommending that. There's more of a quasi-governmental entity as we are coming to understand. And we're looking more carefully at how the removal of that exemption would affect nonprofits and other organizations that are currently exempted and looking to reduce the any burdens that are intent, which is to increase transparency in the decision-making process of the city, how any burdens that creates could be minimized. So that's where we are and stay tuned. \nSPEAKER_02:  So to make it clear, because I think it was a little unclear, we would be recommending that the business districts have an exemption because they are quasi-governmental entities. They have public meetings with publicly posted agendas, so their business is more publicly held. And then we've also been discussing putting in an exemption for a neighborhood associations that are recognized by the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right, and I think that's where we still have, there are a few more things we're trying to understand. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we will be back next. \nSPEAKER_02:  month with a recommendation, hopefully. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so then I think Commissioner D. Vanacdick, this is doing the report for our next ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. So the vendor code of conduct at Hawk has met twice since our last meeting. During that time, we have honed it down little by little. We've moved towards, you'll notice that we're going to pre-proposing the title change to supplier code of conduct. But it is going to be a little bit more, I always like a high readability score. So it's going to be, one of our goals is to be aspirational. It's going to be brief. And we are going to rely on the terms and conditions to really go over more of the compliance pieces. We really want to put the values and our code of conduct, the city's code of conduct, the forefront of what the vendors will be adopting and kind of setting the expectations. Our last meeting, the ad hoc is now relying on staff to take a look at it. I'll say city eyes it. Make sure it makes sense and solicit who they need to solicit. And then we'll gather again. And I'm I'm thinking that we might gather again next week. That was our hope. And the goal would be to bring this forward in May possibly. I'd all defer to the team. The ad hoc to decide whether or not it's close to a band. I'll say closing off our ad. Our ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Any questions for Commissioner D. Dictates or Commissioner Shotwell? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. Any public comment on this item? Can I have a motion to receive in fire, please? \nSPEAKER_02:  It's been moved by Commissioner Shotwell, second by Commissioner Fiedler. \nSPEAKER_02:  is demonstrated."
