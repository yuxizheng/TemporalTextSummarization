        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Now we move on to agenda item 2. Can you please read the next agenda item? \nSPEAKER_03:  recommendation to request City Attorney to prepare a draft of equity and human relations commission by loss. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. If you recall, we've had some discussion in the past on need for bylaws to really help crystallize the processes that we have undertaken for quite some time. \nSPEAKER_01:  And bylaws are really going to help us move our work forward once we actually have a direction that will be down in stone. So I'm going to ask the attorney Taylor Anderson to share just a little bit more context in that for us and then help us move with the direction of why we're doing the bylaws and the next steps for that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we've been... \nSPEAKER_05:  As the chair said, we've been talking about this for quite some time. I'm not sure if you guys are aware, but you don't have by-laws and they're a very, very important document for a commission. So basically what by-laws are going to do is we're going to codify the way that this commission operates into a document. You're all going to agree on the types of things, right, the go in the document. Some of them are going to be legal ones. And then some of them are going to be surrounding the way that you guys conduct your discussion. Part of this is to help you become more efficient. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  We've noticed a trend lately in the last six, eight months, where a lot of items are getting laid over in your meetings. And sometimes that happens, but what we want to do is correct course and get back on track and doing things like sticking to Robert's rules of order, sticking to the Brown Act, sticking to, I'm going to give you a presentation on motions in the coming months to help you be more efficient in the way that we're doing that. These smaller things and tools that we can implement will help your meetings to be more efficient as a body that has 15 available seats. That is a lot of people to have an opinion and to make sure that folks are being heard. So that's really where this is coming from is we're hoping to provide some structure around your commission and then to help make things more efficient. \nSPEAKER_05:  with that being said. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know. \nSPEAKER_05:  You guys are unique in a lot of ways from other commissions in the way that you operate. You are \nSPEAKER_05:  collaborative to the nth degree, right? So I wanna make sure that we're capturing that in the bylaws. I'm going to tell you this right now, I am not perfect. I am going to do my best with what I have seen in what you guys are operating and pulling from other bylaws and examples from other commissions. \nSPEAKER_05:  If, when I bring this document back, I have not nailed it. That is okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  You will have an opportunity to red line that document and provide feedback. My goal is to get the document back to you with plenty of time before the next meeting for you to digest what it says. And whether or not that you think it's something that \nSPEAKER_05:  represents what this commission is about, right? And that's the point, right? There are rules that you're all agreeing to operate within. With that being said, \nSPEAKER_05:  We had a discussion about whether or not community agreements would be appropriate for this commission. That's something that I want you to think about. Whether or not when we come back, we can talk about it today too. I know Alana is a lot more familiar with that concept than I am, right? \nSPEAKER_05:  We can do a pilot program. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? Where you're not committed to doing a community agreement for a long term, we can try it for a shorter period of time. One of the examples that I was given is the why am I talking? If you notice that you are controlling the dialogue and that other people haven't had an opportunity to speak, maybe taking a pause. Not that we don't want to hear your wonderful thoughts. \nSPEAKER_05:  The creating space for other people in the commission to also communicate their thoughts. \nSPEAKER_05:  So those types of concepts, if you would like to see them in there when I draft them right now, I can add them, we can have the discussion here. If you want me to come back, I find that it's a lot easier to red line a document and tell me what you love and you hate about it than it is for me to talk about the concepts of it. So we can have a more robust discussion when we bring the document back. So you can have a little bit of a better idea of what I'm talking about. I can't just bring you a document without you asking me for it, which is why there's a little bit of a disconnect here. \nSPEAKER_05:  But any feedback that you give to me today, I just would ask that you come to a consensus on that the commission as a whole agrees on it, not just one commissioner, right? So it's all of your voices together, not just one of you. If you have any questions about what this document is, I'm happy to answer them for you, or if you have ideas, yield to the chair. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for that illuminating context. Can I get a motion on this item so we can move over to discussions? \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh \nSPEAKER_01:  I had a name here but it just lost I think that was Commissioner Gutierrez that I saw. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Well there, thank you. Commissioner with the others. And connected. Second, I see Commissioner Cometan. I'm going to move over to the public. Often it's very helpful to hear the public. And then we can engage. Well, not necessarily engage, but in here from them. And then we can have our comments. So is there a member of public? \nSPEAKER_03:  If there are any members of the public who would like to speak here in person on item number two, please line up at the podium this time. \nSPEAKER_03:  thing then. \nSPEAKER_01:  Madam Clark, can you check with our online presence? Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  If there are any members of the public in the Zoom that would like to speak on item number two, please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now. \nSPEAKER_03:  seeing that. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, thank you, Madam Clerk. I'm going to move on to our discussion now as commissioners. So there are any commissioners, thoughts on requesting. Bye, lots to be created. \nSPEAKER_01:  Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr \nSPEAKER_01:  Can I share with you guys? \nSPEAKER_01:  Larry, Commissioner of the others. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thank you, Chair. And, um, so I have two comments, but then also, uh, \nSPEAKER_04:  That's mine. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, so I have two comments and then also a question. So first, just want to say I'm really excited that this item is here. We have definitely been needing something like this and we didn't even know it was available to us, I think, until just recently. So I'm really excited about that. Love the idea of community agreements. We'd love to test those out. So hopefully my fellow commissioners are open to that. And for those, I don't have once and mine necessarily. I would trust that the Office of Equity could bring something that they've seen put in practice. \nSPEAKER_04:  I've seen some of those in practice, even though I can't recall them from the top of my head right now, so I would trust that we would have something good to react to. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then the other comment that I want to make is in our last meeting we started talking about the idea of possible like co-chair relationship and if we decided something like that then that would be something that could be done in the bylaws. So I just want to bring that conversation back up. I don't. \nSPEAKER_04:  quite remember exactly where we landed. I feel like we met a while ago. So if we could just kind of touch base back on that and then clarify that that is correct that that's something we can add to the bylaws. And then finally my last question is will the bylaws also contain information like the length of our meetings and when we meet and like those types of details. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, so revisiting the co-chair issue, if you decide today you want to reconsider the issue of having co-chairs instead of a chair vice chair structure, it's something that we could put into the bylaws. So, this is a link of meeting time, we'll definitely be in there. \nSPEAKER_05:  when you meet at the very least, probably not where you meet because that's still in flux. We typically don't put those in the vylose anyways. That helps us also set what is a regular meeting, right? So regular meeting means the time that you regularly meet, any time that you meet outside of that turns into a special meeting. The noticing requirements under the brown act change, depending on whether it's a regular meeting or a special meeting. So, \nSPEAKER_05:  Those types of things will definitely be in there. \nSPEAKER_05:  And you had a third? \nSPEAKER_05:  question. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  The question of compensation is that to be included in there also. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, that is handled in a separate document. So compensation is in a few different places. It's in the salary resolution. Salary resolution adopted by the City Council assigns which commissions receive what compensation. That information is also mirrored in Long Beach, Venus, Bokode 2.18 as well. The commissioners may be assigned compensation in the salary resolution. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are there any other discussion points for the commission? \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, so can we, I've been asked to make a quick vote on this request. \nSPEAKER_01:  Of course, come and share with you guys. \nSPEAKER_04:  So, with the co-chair idea, is that something that we, I think we, would we discuss that today? Or that's something that we would discuss at the next meeting when you came and presented? I think you had wondered maybe some consensus today, is that correct? \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm in different. I anticipate that today is, it's difficult for you guys to completely understand what I'm talking about without seeing an actual tangible document. So if you know that you wanna agree upon it today, great. \nSPEAKER_05:  for any issue, right? But... \nSPEAKER_05:  You can also, when we bring the document back, think about it. And if we want to add it, you can add it at that time. What that means is that we won't be adopting bylaws at the next meeting, but that's okay. We would come back at the following meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  with a red line of the changes that you had requested. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have my recommendation is to bring everything, you know, to the next meeting proposed and then we can react to it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I think that that'll be, my experience as the easiest for the commissions to do that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for the clarification. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So come here. \nSPEAKER_01:  For clarification, then the direction would be to include in this version a co-chair model in the BiOS. Correct? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, and community agreement. \nSPEAKER_01:  and community agreements. Okay. I'm going to echo the community agreements. I think there's different versions, perhaps some data commissioners. I don't know if other commissions uses, but I think that would be helpful. I also would like to see a version of the bylaws that has that as a version. However, what I'd also recommend is crystallized within the bylaws is this is a collaborative commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? Hopefully that will continue to be the case indefinitely. Right? But we also need to envision what is at the best interest indefinitely for this commission. So maybe embedded within the bylaws is the avenue for having co-chairs, but also language in there in the event that commission may choose chairs or that option. Is that something that the commission is comfortable with? \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so I'm not hearing an objection to what the chair said. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm coming to share with you guys. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I don't object. I just want to clarify that that then would become something that is decided at each election. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that something that would be in the bylaws where it would say? \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  like that either model is... \nSPEAKER_04:  It could work for this commission, whether it be a co-chair or a chair vice chair, and then that's decided at each election point. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So that is, it's up to you. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is your guys' bylaws, so if you want to pursue that path, that's totally fine. So... \nSPEAKER_05:  What I'm hearing. \nSPEAKER_05:  because we have to repeat it back for the chord. So what I'm hearing is \nSPEAKER_05:  that you're asking the city attorney to prepare a draft of the equity and human relations commission by loss with community agreements proposed by the Office of Equity and an option for a co-chair or chair vice chair structure to be decided at the chair election. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so that would be the motion that you guys are voting on. \nSPEAKER_01:  correct. That's my understanding. And I don't want to over complicate things. And I also don't want to assume when you come back with these bylaws will also be like \nSPEAKER_01:  either in writing or the verbal presentation from you implications for for this so that we can kind of really see this through before we go. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it would be best if the commission, just because it's \nSPEAKER_05:  You guys have so much work and so little time. It would be best if you came with questions or if you have questions in advance to email me and then I can address them on the floor. I just... \nSPEAKER_05:  pretty practice addressing things on the floor. So if you just come with questions, that's fine too. And we can work through your concerns on the floor with certain items rather than me doing it for everything because I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  It'll make sense for everything. If you feel strongly that you want me to give a presentation on everything, I can do that. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it would be more efficient if you guys came with questions and concerns about the items that you're worried about implications. \nSPEAKER_01:  Perfect. Can I work with the machine or Nikolson? \nSPEAKER_00:  I will pay you to stop using the word guys. \nSPEAKER_00:  I wanted in the bylaws of the women's commission that we never say the word guys. \nSPEAKER_00:  Just drop it. You don't need to say they or them or gals or guys. Just drop it all together. You can just be you \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm very... \nSPEAKER_00:  I want to find a verb here. I'm very... \nSPEAKER_00:  I have spent this month thinking deeply about how to present my feelings about vice chair co chair and now actually you're At least suggesting that you might create an ordinance that allows whether it's vice chair a co chair to change with the feeling of the body or Possibly the feeling of the chair how much they could take on or not take on or if there's somebody wants to be the vice chair or Or or chair a co chair in other words, I would prefer that My preference is to actually vote tonight on whether or not this commission has a co chair or vice chair architecture driving the leadership of this Commission and if that is possible then I Would like to open up conversation to speak to that choice and then vote on that choice. Thank you \nSPEAKER_05:  My apologies, Commissioner Nicholson. I will do better. \nSPEAKER_01:  Die Kommunik notifications. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair. I had a clarifying question. So in this conversation today, I know we started the conversation last month, but this is now an opportunity to give you recommendations to include into the bylaws. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. I wanted to get clarity on that so that we could actually simmer on some of the ideas if folks are ready to share those now is the time to do so. And then when we come back next month, we'll be hopefully voting or giving questions and feedback on them to be able to vote. So thank you for that, Clarify. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what I'm hearing is, um, \nSPEAKER_01:  discussion point on whether we can decide at this point the direction to give City Attorney on how to craft the decision making point between chair or vice chair. Just to extend kind of my comments earlier, I am looking after the long arc over the commission and \nSPEAKER_01:  I wouldn't necessarily want there to be this case, but it could be a case where perhaps co-chairs may not work five years, ten years, or whatever that might be the case. I think part of our charge is to look after potential scenarios that could occur and bake them in to the skeleton of the by-laws. And so in particular cases where the co-chair works, great, if a commissioner in there will be aware of where the whole commission changes and none of us will be on this one that were turned out. So that's what I'm looking at in order for the longer arc of this commission and to make sure that the by-laws reflect that flexibility. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that's kind of where I'm at it. I want to hear. \nSPEAKER_01:  folks and see where they stand on that. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if it's helpful. \nSPEAKER_05:  The bylaws are not in concrete. \nSPEAKER_05:  just because you adopt them in the coming months does not mean they cannot be amended at a later time. You're not stuck with these bylaws forever. You can bring them on any Wednesday that you guys are reading and have an open discussion to add or take things out that serve or do not serve you. So if that's helpful, great. If that's not what you want to codify, also find. \nSPEAKER_05:  I just need direction and consensus from all of you on what you'd like to do. If we continue this discussion, it's kind of leading in a direction that if you're going to agree on this issue tonight, we might want to take a formal vote rather than consensus because it seems like \nSPEAKER_05:  There may not be consensus on this item to make sure that we're capturing everybody's opinions. So we would take a separate vote on this issue in particular. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then vote to adopt the bylaws with whatever the group agrees on. But if you can come to a consensus, that works too. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to recommend that we move with the agenda item with the addition of Commissioner Gutierrez piece on having language in there that could help with the co-chair piece if, you know, there's some flexibility and there is that something that we're comfortable with. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  and so we can call for a vote. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if you're not comfortable, now is the time that you should object. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner with Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_00:  I apologize. \nSPEAKER_00:  Point of clarification please. I need further definition of what this period is dedicated to, is it the conversation about to chair to coer to vice. And if so, I would like to address that. And is that now? \nSPEAKER_00:  Florida. \nSPEAKER_00:  to talk about coal or vice. \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, I was referring to... \nSPEAKER_01:  the recommendation to make sure that the buying laws of these diversion that we get at our next meeting have that flexibility again. If by all means if you have thoughts on that I encourage you to share so that we can ensure it's vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, I think I understand now. Thank you very much. I put a lot of thought into this. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think we're equity starts. \nSPEAKER_00:  is here. \nSPEAKER_00:  before we walk into our districts. \nSPEAKER_00:  before we behave in public. \nSPEAKER_00:  The beautiful coat of contact. I'm so happy to get that. \nSPEAKER_00:  but I believe equity starts here. And that means that all the power and all the leadership and the voice \nSPEAKER_00:  is shared. \nSPEAKER_00:  And the quietest person needs to be heard. \nSPEAKER_00:  I remember that from teaching school. \nSPEAKER_00:  Who's the kid who doesn't raise their hand and is at my fault? \nSPEAKER_00:  So \nSPEAKER_00:  I would like to take all the things each of us believe about the application of. \nSPEAKER_00:  equity and apply it to the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  to shine the light on the shyest. \nSPEAKER_00:  to make sure everybody is equally acknowledged. \nSPEAKER_00:  to kind of make it uncomfortable to never speak. \nSPEAKER_00:  but in a kind way. \nSPEAKER_00:  And following that logic and \nSPEAKER_00:  my point of view. \nSPEAKER_00:  I do believe that co-chairing is a strong statement in the architecture of a commission. And I believe it illustrates our commitment to the practice of equity. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Chair Nicholson. Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. I just want to stress once again that we've all mentioned. \nSPEAKER_07:  how collaborative this commission works together. \nSPEAKER_07:  and... \nSPEAKER_07:  I for one believe the flexibility. \nSPEAKER_07:  will allow us to continue to do that. \nSPEAKER_07:  I believe that. \nSPEAKER_07:  if something's not working. \nSPEAKER_07:  that we will recognize it and we can make the adjustments. \nSPEAKER_07:  Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but that's just my opinion right now. Because it's been stressed. \nSPEAKER_07:  even though we might agree. \nSPEAKER_07:  It didn't mean that it can't be changed in the future at any one of these meetings. So I don't see a problem with giving it a try if all of us are in agreement on it. It's not said in stone. \nSPEAKER_07:  There is still the flexibility there to change the language at any... \nSPEAKER_07:  Point and time moving forward in the future. \nSPEAKER_07:  They'd nothing be to failure but to try. \nSPEAKER_07:  And we tend to have pretty open minds in addressing a lot of these issues. And I don't see any reason why I wouldn't be willing to give this a shot. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  any other commissioners? \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Govinda? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  For the sake of conversation, we have two points that we're addressing. It's the recommendation to add the code of conduct and add the option for co-chair vice chair within the bylaws. And then separate from that is a conversation or an ask to actually have a conversation to have a conversation or potentially a vote for our leadership to either be a co-chair or vice chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  for the purpose of today in terms of vice chair, co chair, \nSPEAKER_02:  model. \nSPEAKER_02:  the chair and vice chair we haven't talked about that as of yet and so I would like an opportunity for us to discuss where we land since we were voted in as two officers for this commission and that's something that we could bring back out of further time um if the rest of the commission is okay with that \nSPEAKER_01:  thoughts on Commissioner Covington's idea. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Gutierrez. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, thank you. So I think that it would probably be a good time to call the vote for this. I think that we've \nSPEAKER_04:  all of this discussion that we're having, I think it's going to go into the next meeting. Right, when we actually are presented the bylaws, so I think what was on the floor is \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  asking City Attorney to include community agreements, a co-chair option. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then including the values of our collaboration and things like that that we talked about. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think if more discussion is to be had, I would recommend saving it for next month when we actually have something to respond to. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that would be my recommendation. \nSPEAKER_01:  agreed that way we have the language and really wrap our brains around it and so with that said Commissioner Guti\u00e9rrez I'll call for Alastim Edingler to take the vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  better. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we clarify the motion? \nSPEAKER_03:  didn't think that had been the initial \nSPEAKER_03:  Recommendation was moved by Commissioner Gitares and Vice Chair Covington. Did they accept the friendly to amend it to include the co-chair? \nSPEAKER_03:  model and then also the community agreement. \nSPEAKER_03:  or we're just simply... \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I accept. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So madam Claire, cover. \nSPEAKER_03:  You can now vote on your tablet. \nSPEAKER_03:  motion is carried."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  Thank you Madam Clerk. Can you please read the next agenda item? \nSPEAKER_02:  Recommendation to discuss the Equity and Human Relations Commission 2023 Roadmap Priorities. \nSPEAKER_03:  So a couple of months ago, there was an ad hoc committee charged with the task of creating the roadmap. We voted on key topics for the roadmap, but we're now right at a point where we recognize that even with the final version of the roadmap, there's only so much that we can do within the given two-year time frame that we allotted for ourselves. So the Office of Equity is going to engage us in a process for mapping out the priorities within the context of that roadmap. So I'm going to ask the Office of Equity team to lead us in that part of the meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair Laura. Can I get the presentation up please? \nSPEAKER_00:  Awesome, thank you so much. So good evening, Chair and members of the Epidemic Human Relations Commission. Really, really excited to bring this back to you. All it's been a while since we talked about our roadmap and our priorities. Just our intent for tonight's item is to just refresh everybody's memory on that journey. We started this conversation back in November of last year. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I think at that time we thought it would be a very simple journey and process. And essentially we've been embarking on what's... \nSPEAKER_00:  but felt like a strategic planning process that said we have talked about policy, our commission's capacity to respond to time sensitive and urgent matters. Setting up a policy agenda for the year as well as \nSPEAKER_00:  The infrastructure to me and achieve the vision of the Equity and Human Relations Commission. So I just wanted to remind you all of how we got there. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  We began in November by exploring our why. And so on the screen right now, you have a list of those themes that came from that conversation. It was a sticky board exercise that was facilitated by Deputy City Manager Teresa Chandler. These themes, the Office of Equity then took. And then we synthesized and drew connections from your, \nSPEAKER_00:  areas of interest, your priorities as a commission, and we connected them to the four goals of the racial equity and reconciliation initiative. So that's what you see on screen right now. \nSPEAKER_00:  Next, we actually you all took it upon yourselves to then deduce even further by proposing one of the establishment of the Roadmap ad hoc committee and then giving the commission the homework assignment of identifying a topic policy and initiative resource and subgroup to help us hone in on how we um... \nSPEAKER_00:  proceed in what our priorities are. So just to quickly walk you through those definitions, the topic is an issue. We're theme that advances the commission's mission to inspire and support social justice and equity in the city of Long Beach and foster mutual understanding for all. \nSPEAKER_00:  policies and initiatives that you all could have identified would be defined as actionable recommendations that the commission will move forward to the city council. Resources would be tools, approaches and assets strategies that further equity and human relations in the city. These would be resources staff could use but also resources that the community can use. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then finally the subgroup, this is really looking at the infrastructure of the commission and how do we convene smaller bodies of the equity and human relations commission to support the long-term operations and agenda work that we discuss here. \nSPEAKER_00:  That said, \nSPEAKER_00:  you all then brought those priorities back and voted on \nSPEAKER_00:  your top three priorities within each of those index or indicators. So you identified three topics, three policies and initiatives for the commission to prioritize three resources and three subgroups. And this brings us back to the next slide. \nSPEAKER_00:  to today's meeting now where we're finally taking that information and representing it to you. The intent now is that you all are going to \nSPEAKER_00:  with the five stickers that were given to you, you're gonna vote on your top five priorities. It doesn't matter what category, but \nSPEAKER_00:  You're gonna place those stickers on the... \nSPEAKER_00:  next to whichever item on this roadmap is a generative to you and very interesting. So with that, I'm going to ask Tony to set up our easel and board. So we brought that so that you all can just come from behind the dius using those stickers to identify your priorities for the commission. And this concludes my presentation. I will leave the slide up for members of the public recognizing that they can't see the board. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a clarifying question. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is it rank order voting? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so we've color coded it. There's a legend on this green eye. I apologize. So the red sticker is your number one priority yellow will be your number two. \nSPEAKER_00:  three will be green. And then because it only came with four colors, we have a four as just blue, but the blue sticker with the X is going to be your your fifth priority. \nSPEAKER_03:  I want to say thank you for the prep lists of the outlets. I know it takes a lot of prep breaks. So thank you for that and for setting this up. And I have to say the visuals, the visuals are very helpful. Before we do the process, I just want to check in with the city attorney. Do we have to take public comment first or do we can we engage? \nSPEAKER_03:  with the process for the sake of adhering to rules here. \nSPEAKER_01:  So you can do either. You can take public comment before or you can all vote and then take public comment after. \nSPEAKER_01:  seen that there's a limited amount of the public. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think you'd be okay in whatever choice that you may have. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, just want to make sure that the processes, so why don't we do the public process, public comment process first, make sure that that's on record and then we'll move forward. Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_02:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number three in public, please line about the podium this time. \nSPEAKER_02:  See you next time. \nSPEAKER_02:  And if there are any members of the public in the Zoom, I would like to speak on item number three. Please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now. \nSPEAKER_02:  See you then. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, thank you Madam Clerk. So at this point, we are going to engage in the process. Tony, was there additional stuff that you need to lead us on? Or do we just start going to the... \nSPEAKER_03:  to the visual here. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, you can just start running. So please come on up, you're free. \nSPEAKER_00:  Come on. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I do a puzzle. \nSPEAKER_00:  I do apologize for the small font. If you do come to the board, it is a little easier to read. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Alright everyone, thank you for participating. I'm going to go ahead and table the discussion that way it gives a lot of time to tabulate what's on the board and then we can come back during the same meeting. But I want to check in with everyone to see if there are any objectives to table in. \nSPEAKER_03:  the discussion and the results."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  So if there are no objectives, I'm going to ask Madam Park to read the next agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  Recommendations to authorize the Chair and Vice Chair to draft letter from the Equity and Human Relations Commission to the City Council recommending the City Council denounce students for fair and missions ink. \nSPEAKER_03:  versus President and Fellows of Harvard College and Creative LLC at LVL versus Alenis at LVL. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Madam Clerk. Now for context here, I reached out to the Office of Equity for this agenda item in consultation with the Vice Chair Coveington. As tends to be the case every June, there are several cases that are decided. And for expediency purposes, I'll refer to the first case as the affirmative action case. And the second case is the LGBTQ case. And so essentially what happened, the affirmative action case was rules first, essentially the decision makes it put on quote-unquote illegal for any admissions office across the United States to take a race into account for deciding admission cases. Unfortunately, my opinion of this has already been the case in California since the late 90s due to Proposition 209. But now this is the law of the land for the entire United States. And when we look at our racial admission cases following what happened here in California, we actually saw a decrease in admission for students of color in particular. So the concern is that we might see this trend nationwide. Not surprisingly, we see many social justice-oriented organizations, nonprofits in particular issue out statements regarding the case. And this was also the case for the LGBTQ case. Many of you might be more familiar with that, particularly case as the website case. So given our charge, although local, I think it's important for us when cases of these nature rise as to chime in to the national discourse, the only, and I wouldn't call it a concern, it was just a caveat in the discussion. We only meet once a month. And so the momentum, when statements like these are issued are usually as soon as the decisions are decided. So I think I'm very open to discussion whether a month after that, because at this point, the motion would be for us to drop the letter. We wouldn't come back to this until we're not meeting next month, so that would be September. And then depending on the language, have a discussion on that. And then it would go to city council. So I do want to also put that context in there. I think this totally falls online with what we do as a commission. But that once a month meeting is what really kind of puts, I would say a little down-brown, that I think it's important to chime in regardless. But I want to open this out for the commission, obviously, to see where we land on national issues like this, a little bit a lot of organizations and entities do provide statements for. So I'll leave it at that and open up for commission. I'm sorry, for public comment. And we'll go through that process and then we'll go through commission. Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_03:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak here in person on item number four please line up at the podium this time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then if there's any members of the public in the Zoom that would like to speak on item number four. \nSPEAKER_03:  please use the racen feature or dial star 9 now. \nSPEAKER_03:  thing done. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Commissioner Guti\u00e9rrez. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, Commissioner Camacho. \nSPEAKER_05:  Point of order do we have to take a motion in a second before discussion. \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh, for that, that's a very important step. Can I have a motion? \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. Acamacho. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to give that second. Let's come and share with the others. \nSPEAKER_07:  I actually want to correct that it's Commissioner Betts. \nSPEAKER_07:  Now, I love Love for Comment. I want to check in with Commissioner Camacho. Did you also have a comment on that? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, you mentioned that I put it in when we were talking, but I think just re-interreading the effects of Prop 2 and I and in the resolution, whatever you draw, because we can see historically less already happened when decisions like this have already been made. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that was my only comment as you draw. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, thank you. Do we know that proper certain tone line? Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner with the Ennis. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I just want to thank you for bringing this. I think that in our history as a commission, we've, I think sometimes felt discouraged by bringing things like this to condemn and speak out on just because of the lengthy process. So I do want to just recognize that it is important for us to share our voice no matter what the process is. And then I also want to remind the commission that at our May meeting, when we did our ad and Hock Report out, we did have a few different scenarios that we had proposed for things like this if we ever did want to do quick action. And so one of the scenarios was to make a timely public statement about a current event. And I think in the future, if we did want to make a more timely statement, we're going \nSPEAKER_02:  one option would be to bring a letter. Well, if it's a letter, obviously that requires more input, but if it's just an easy statement condemning something that happened, there is a possibility to bring something like that at the same time as the agenda item to be able to vote then and there. So I just wanted to remind the commission about that possibility for future public events and Supreme Court actions and whatnot that we want to condemn. \nSPEAKER_02:  So thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, let me show you the ears for that, that reminder. \nSPEAKER_07:  any other commissioners? \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Camacho. \nSPEAKER_05:  And this is a question for the city attorney. I'm really gonna try not to veer off the rails here, but is there, because we just talked about the bylaws, is there like a version? And I'm going like way into the weeds here like. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is there like a form-based code for comments so like we can have in our by-laws that it's within the power of the chair and vice chair to draft letters in between meetings and bring them to the meetings for a formal vote? Or is it we have to vote each time on it? I think of like form-based code with housing policy like as long as it needs a certain thing. \nSPEAKER_05:  Like it's approved but not that it's approved but like they can draw something in it again \nSPEAKER_05:  come to the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I'm going to repeat back what you've said to make sure that I'm understanding. So what you're saying is that you want to recognize in the bylaws the chair has the ability to draft a letter for the commission to basically red line in a prove. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  without the commission requesting the letter initially. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right? So in this situation, the chair would have brought a letter to the commission and the commission either agrees or disagrees. \nSPEAKER_04:  with the language and the letter. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that what you're hoping for? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that you could do that. \nSPEAKER_04:  If that's something that you're interested in. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it would be important for you guys to articulate the subject matters that you're okay with the chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  drafting a letter about like you'll have the ability to \nSPEAKER_04:  You'll have the ability to make changes to the letter, but I think it would be helpful if you were all in agreement. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. So for example, \nSPEAKER_04:  The chair would have an ability to draft a letter taking a position in favor of the LBGTQ plus community, right? Or so, right? So in this case, the decision against them. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. \nSPEAKER_04:  He would be able to write a letter of like, hey, this isn't in favor of them. \nSPEAKER_04:  We don't agree with this. This is about idea city council. We want you to take a position. \nSPEAKER_04:  something to that effect. Do you know what I mean? So if you can articulate some spaces that you guys are comfortable \nSPEAKER_04:  And we can look at what your duties are to articulate some of that. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'll request that we agenda that at a meeting after the \nSPEAKER_05:  It doesn't even go in this version of my list, but I think it's going to need a whole discussion about it. But I think that gets around our timeliness issue that we've talked about a lot, like we've met once a month. So if we just agendize the discussion about creating guidelines that we could include about. \nSPEAKER_05:  drafting a letter. \nSPEAKER_05:  drafting letters in the future. I just request that it be agendas for future meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  And to be honest with you, I think the chair, if that's the way that you want to do business, I think the chair can just write the letter. We don't have to necessarily codify it in the bylaws. Now that I'm thinking through this. \nSPEAKER_04:  if you're going to do that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  The commission should agree on the letter before it goes to council. Right? As opposed to giving the chair a carte, like, kind of carte-banche to send a letter to council without you guys seeing it. \nSPEAKER_04:  That makes sense. \nSPEAKER_05:  still agenda for a future discussion I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  having a discussion about how we want to do that. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I took a note here, but I just want to clarify so that when we consider the gentising out a little peer on there. So \nSPEAKER_07:  the recommendations to agenda a discussion on the, let's call it the framework for a chair to write a letter, a position letter, correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you and next here I have Commissioner Guidellas. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just wanted to add one quick distinction to just recognizing that what I was sharing about what we talked about in May was when we're denouncing something, right, versus asking the City Council to denounce something. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just wanted to make sure that was clear because it's reflecting on my comments. I wasn't sure if I made that clear. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this commission's advisory to the City Council, you wouldn't have the ability to denounce something on your own. It would be through a recommendation to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so because many times in the past have wrote a letter, like with the EHRC's, like, \nSPEAKER_02:  and be making a statement about. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  and a particular \nSPEAKER_02:  situation or event. \nSPEAKER_04:  So it really should be through the mechanism of advising the city council because that's the authority of this body, right? You don't have independent authority to opine on behalf of the city. It would need to be through the city council who would take a beneficial position on it. \nSPEAKER_04:  So you would take in a position through your recommendation to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, so in the past, like I think last year was the last time we did this, we, or maybe a couple of years ago, we denounced the AAPI hate that was happening. And so we wrote a formal, like, condemnation of what was happening and sent our letter to, or not letter, just sent our, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  condemning, you know, statement to the City Council, but it wasn't asking the City Council to take any action or denounce. It was just our statement that as the HRC, we denounce this hatred that's happening. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, saying we're not, we weren't technically supposed to do that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I was taking that as more of an open letter. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right? So... \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think you could do that. It would be more powerful for you to advise the City Council to take. \nSPEAKER_04:  like for long beach to take that position as opposed to an advisory commission do you know what I mean? Because what happens is like \nSPEAKER_04:  Sometimes City Council will adopt a resolution and then that resolution gets forwarded to lawmakers and the people who are in decision making positions above local government. Right. Of like the city formally. \nSPEAKER_04:  disagrees with sometimes this is a Supreme Court opinion. So you know what I mean? Like we'll do it through Amicus briefs. We can do it. We have federal and state legislative. \nSPEAKER_04:  Agenda that get adopted where we form the city formally is four or against state and federal laws, right? \nSPEAKER_04:  I think if you're going to do that, I would have more power. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right for you guys to recommend that CityCamp push City Council to make a formal action. You can denounce what's happening, but if what you're trying to do is effectuate change and for the City to take a position, right, it would be a recommendation to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does that make sense? Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Commissioner Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_00:  I really want to agree with what was proposed that the co-chair, vice chair and chair, those two people, whatever titles they have, come to the council with a commission with a fully written letter. It's just the same as what Taylor is saying that it's easier for us to go through and edit change red line by law. So if you feel strongly and want to bring it to the floor and have the commission vote on it, it's much better for us to have a letter in advance where we can read it. I think that's a great idea because this whole thing needs to get streamlined. Things have floated away that are really off. We never should have let flowed away. I don't remember if being this incumbent, I stood in that well many times in the Oak Council Chamber asking the council to do something. For example, they actually endorsed the correct amendment years ago. \nSPEAKER_00:  They voted on C-DOT years ago. So I really like that idea, whatever you can do to speed this up, so it's still pertinent. So I support that idea. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you Commissioner Covington. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a question for our WCD attorney. \nSPEAKER_06:  for our commission, are we allowed to request approval and \nSPEAKER_06:  approve a letter in the same agenda item. \nSPEAKER_06:  So for instance, if... \nSPEAKER_06:  Our chair drafted a letter and came in September with here is a letter that pretty much our recim our agenda item today which is authorized asking the commission to authorize a letter. Could you? \nSPEAKER_06:  recommend to authorize the letter and vote on the letter in the same agenda item. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I think what it would be is we would change the language of this item to be... \nSPEAKER_04:  recommendation to approve the chair and vice chair to send a letter on behalf of the equity and human relations commission to the City Council recommending the City Council denounce so on and so forth. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then... \nSPEAKER_04:  what would happen in that meeting instead of the conversation that's happening now is that it would likely be a red line. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the commissioners would provide feedback on changes that they think should be made to the letter. And that would basically be encompassed in a motion. Depending on the degree of changes, I think would be whether the letter should come back or not. Right. So if the commission completely obliterates the letter. \nSPEAKER_04:  And it's a completely different letter. It might be in the best interest of the commission to see the revised version if you're completely not in agreement as a body for what the letter says. If it's like, oh, chair, you forgot a comma. Or a smaller changes like that, or a couple tweaks to wording, small ads. I think that the chair could make those changes \nSPEAKER_04:  I would share vice chair could make those changes and send the letter on. I think it would depend on how substantive the changes are to the letter and how much in agreement the chair's position is with what the commission's position is, right? So hopefully the Venn diagram is a circle. \nSPEAKER_04:  But it's possible that the chair may feel strongly about an issue, but the entire body doesn't feel the same way. And that's why it's important to have the discussion on. Does that make sense? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Abat. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was just going to say I agree with the Commissioner Zoe and \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Camacho who suggested I think we need to really work as Hard as possible to kind of streamline a lot of this stuff and If you were to come either chair or co-chair with a letter that could be reviewed and just edits can be Done under the pretense that the letter's not going directly to council, right? It's here for us to review I think that helps us as a commission To be able to push through The information a lot faster than waiting a whole another month \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So unless there's further discussion, \nSPEAKER_07:  I think voting on moving forward with the letter, right? And then we can bring back something and then have that. And I think they appreciate the recommendations about streamlining this process. So that because these things will come up again, whether it's this case or future case or some other issue, I think the more we do to streamline this, those are well for the commission in order to move quicker. So appreciate all the work and recommendation to make that happen. Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_03:  You can vote on your talents. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_03:  Motion is carried. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you."

Sometimes they're called sunshine ordinances, shining light into the dark spaces and that's really what the Brown Act is intended to do. \nSPEAKER_05:  government happens so that the people can see what is happening. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, principles of the Brown Act, all meetings are shall we open in public? \nSPEAKER_05:  Actions and deliberations must be taken openly. \nSPEAKER_05:  All persons shall be permitted to attend and participate in the meetings and only matters on the agenda can maybe discuss. \nSPEAKER_05:  So a big concept in the Brown Act is avoiding the appearance of improv. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it encourages avoiding the possibility of impropriety, discussing local agency business, and to avoid the appearance of a brown act violation. There are other reasons why commissioners should avoid giving public testimony or trying to influence the outcome of proceedings before another. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commission or Council such as due process this body is solely advisory Commissions where that can be problematic or like the harbor commission or the planning commission where they're able to make entitlement decisions they can have hearings \nSPEAKER_05:  It's land use issues and contracts, right? That's really where do process comes into play. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we talk about this all the time. I'm sure you've heard me say it. Avoid appearance of impropriety, but what does that mean? \nSPEAKER_05:  It means that there's a perception that they're made that wrongdoing or misconduct may have occurred. It calls into question a commissioner's ability to carry out their official responsibilities with fairness and partiality objectivity and integrity. \nSPEAKER_05:  Appearances of impropriety can undermine the public's faith in trust and government, and that's the whole reason that we're here. \nSPEAKER_05:  So who is subject to the Brown Act? It applies to legislative bodies, which is actually quite a broad term. It means the City Council, advisory commissions created by the City Council, such as yourselves, and advisory commissions created by the Charter. So Parks and Rat Commission, Harvard Commission, Ethics Commission, redistricting. \nSPEAKER_05:  It applies to subcommittees created by formal action. So, good example of this is the Council's standing committee, such as budget oversight and intergovernmental affairs. \nSPEAKER_05:  It is not applied to temporary ad hoc committees made up of solid commissioners and constituting less than a quorum of the body. So we've talked about this before standing committees because. \nSPEAKER_05:  R \nSPEAKER_05:  for a continuing issue, right? Those committees need to be subject to the Brown Act, the public has to have access. \nSPEAKER_05:  ad hoc committees for a limited time or a limited issue. \nSPEAKER_05:  aren't required to be subject to the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  And don't, you know, noticeing requirements, the public doesn't necessarily have to be present. \nSPEAKER_05:  So what constitutes a meeting? \nSPEAKER_05:  A meeting is any congregation of a majority of commissioners at the same time of place to hear or discuss or deliberate on any item that's within the subject matter jurisdiction of the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  includes regular and special meetings. And a majority of commissioners needed to hold a meeting is also known as a quorum. \nSPEAKER_05:  Those terms are used somewhat interchangeably. \nSPEAKER_05:  So here is an example of what Cora looks like. For City Council, there are nine seats. Number for Cora is five people. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  Police oversight commission seven. \nSPEAKER_05:  Number for quorum is four. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh \nSPEAKER_05:  And then you guys 15 number of a quorum is eight. \nSPEAKER_05:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_05:  veteran it's not going to be fixed today but I am going to work on it yeah \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  Veterans Affairs Commission 9. \nSPEAKER_05:  Quorum is up five. \nSPEAKER_05:  So serial meetings and communications are prohibited. What does that mean? It's a majority of commissioners outside of a public meeting communicating, right? So eat. \nSPEAKER_05:  what that really means is \nSPEAKER_05:  There's each communication involves less than a quorum of the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  But the total amount of communications in the series involves a majority of the commission outside of a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  So types of contacts to avoid, I'm going to translate this. \nSPEAKER_05:  into not legal terms. So, emails, texts, social media, communications, involving a majority, whoops says council, commission. It includes making or commenting on social media posts, using digital icons that express reactions to communications, may by other commissioners. So, if you're all liking each other's posts about agenda items outside of a public meeting, \nSPEAKER_05:  That's a problem. If you're re-tweeting, if you're sharing stories, \nSPEAKER_05:  You're harding, you're commenting, you're thums-uping, all of these things. You're making a TikTok dance about what the commission is doing and it gets shared. All of those things can be a violation of the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  So be mindful of that. It sounds like you guys do follow each other on social media. I have a different presentation. Highly recommend also that you keep your social media separate. So commission business is commission business versus your personal, your pictures of your dogs, your cats, your kids, things you're doing outside. All separate from what your life is as a commissioner for a variety of reasons. \nSPEAKER_05:  So serial contacts, there are a few different kinds. There's one called Huff and Spoke. What that means is one commissioner contacts, all or a majority of other commissioners. And I'll have examples of that on the next page. \nSPEAKER_05:  a daisy chain, which is one commissioner context, another member, and then that commissioner context, another commissioner, and then that commissioner context, another one, and so on and so forth. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then by representative. So commissioners representative, agent, intermediary, their partner, a messenger, assistant, their dog walker, it doesn't matter. Directly or indirectly contacts. \nSPEAKER_05:  and communicates with the majority of the other commissioners. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, Huffins Boke. \nSPEAKER_05:  Not this vice chair, but a vice chair. Contacts all our majority of the other commissioners to ensure they vote yes to support an important item. So individually reaches out to every single one of you to make sure that there's consensus on an item. That's a problem under the Brown Act, it's violation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Daisy Chain. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Blue, Contacts Commissioner Green, Commissioner Green, Contacts Commissioner Orange. \nSPEAKER_05:  who contacts Commissioner Pink. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Pink, context and other commissioner and so on and so forth. And so by the time that we get to end the end of all the context, all of you have independently received information outside of a public meeting and had a discussion about \nSPEAKER_05:  an item without the public being present. That is a problem under the Brown Act. It's violation. \nSPEAKER_05:  So by representative. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Greens partner volunteers at several nonprofits, the other commissioners happened to volunteer at also Commissioner Greens partner mentions the green supporting and important item when they run into the other commissioners Systematically the partner is able to communicate to all of you right that \nSPEAKER_05:  They're voting a certain way, so now you know how an item is probably going to go outside of a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's a violation of the brownie. \nSPEAKER_05:  social media it gave that example earlier. So Commissioner Blue creates a post that's like by Commissioner Green, shared by Commissioner Orange, commented down by Commissioner Pink. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's a whole rainbow of problems, right? So it's better to just not. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? \nSPEAKER_05:  And I just want to be clear here. This does not mean that you cannot talk to each other outside of a public meeting. What it means is you need to be thoughtful about what a quorum is for your commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  and limiting the amount of people that you're speaking to outside of a public meeting. We want these discussions to happen so that the public can participate, right? However, clean, messy, great or terrible that may be they have a right to participate in what you're doing here. \nSPEAKER_05:  So what is not a meeting? Individual contacts between a commissioner and another person or commissioner. So individually, if you only contact one other person on the commission, that is not by itself a violation of the Brown Act. If you contact staff, any one of us sitting here, \nSPEAKER_05:  That's not a violation. You're allowed to do that. This exception recognizes the right to confer with constituents, advocates, consultants, reporters, staff, and colleagues. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner meeting with staff. That's not a problem. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair and vice chair meet to discuss the next agenda. That's not a problem, right? A commissioner meeting with a community member. That's not a problem either. It's when you're communicating information. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that information is continuing to be shared. \nSPEAKER_05:  amongst a majority of the members. That's when it starts to be a problem. To be clear to staff is also capable of violating the Brown Act by sharing of like oh I talked to Commissioner Nicholson. I know where she stands on this item. Let me tell you. Right. That's not how staff is already aware that they shouldn't be communicating in that way. \nSPEAKER_05:  but we're all subject to these regulations. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so what is also not a meeting? Majority of commissioners at a conference open to the public. \nSPEAKER_05:  local public meeting so if you all decided to go to city counts together that's okay \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_05:  A better example would be if you went to one of the city budget meetings. It's not a formal meeting of any body of the city, but it's hosted by the city. It's open in public. That would be okay. Open meeting of another body, that example would be city council. \nSPEAKER_05:  Social or ceremony, a little ceremony event, Christmas tree lighting. \nSPEAKER_05:  The only thing is if you go to these public events, you can't talk about commission business while you're there. It should also be sensitive to the fact that if the public is watching you talk to each other, there could be an appearance of impropriety, not that you can't talk to each other, but maybe don't tell secrets to each other in public, right? \nSPEAKER_05:  and don't talk in secret places and have body language like you're having a secret conversation that starts to chip away that there's something nefarious right happening. \nSPEAKER_05:  We don't want that for you. \nSPEAKER_05:  When can meetings be held? So regular meetings, we kind of touched on this with the bylaws. The agenda is posted 72 hours before your Wednesday meeting on the second week of the month. That is your regular time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Special meeting like this one right we're having it in the third or fourth week of the month \nSPEAKER_05:  It can be called by the chair majority of commissioners and the agenda needs to be posted 24 hours before. \nSPEAKER_05:  Where can meetings be held? \nSPEAKER_05:  So within the boundaries of the city, unless a specific exemption applies, meetings must be accessible under the Americans with Disability Act and virtually under certain conditions. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're going to quickly run through this part. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are a lot of new roles from COVID pandemic about what and where meetings can happen. So there's traditional roles. The just cause personal emergency roles and state of emergency declared by the governor. \nSPEAKER_05:  So virtual meetings under the traditional rules. All commissioners have to notice the location that the meeting is held. So if you all had, \nSPEAKER_05:  The most of you had, or some of you had less than a corn of you had \nSPEAKER_05:  Virtual participation and you did it from your home, you would have to notice the location of your meeting at your home. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. All locations must be made available to the public so I don't recommend noticing virtual meetings from your home. Agendas have to be posted at all locations that the meeting is being held and at least a quorum needs to notice the meeting in a location accessible to the public within the city. And all locations must be ADA compliant. \nSPEAKER_05:  So just cause personal emergency. \nSPEAKER_05:  At least a quorum must be present in a singular physical location in the city and it has to be ADA compliant. The public must be given virtual access to the meeting. Traditional rules waived are waived for posting agendas, meaning you don't have to \nSPEAKER_05:  post the agenda as it all the locations, but you do have to identify the tele-conference location in the agenda and make them available to the public. \nSPEAKER_05:  and you're limited to two per year per member and the body does not need to approve when you have this type of emergency. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sorry for just cause emergency has to be approved by the body. \nSPEAKER_05:  even though this is available to you and it seems super awesome and great. There are actual implications of we have talked about time and time again about technology and the ability of the city to do this. So it is \nSPEAKER_05:  difficult for a TAD staff to do this on very short notice. We do need notice to the extent that you have it if you're not able to make the meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  So just something to think about. \nSPEAKER_05:  It works in theory, but in practice, sometimes it's difficult for the city to allow access virtually. It may be better for you to just have an excuse to absence in the meeting if it's possible. \nSPEAKER_05:  So just cause child means child care, caregiving need of a child parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling spouse or domestic partner, contagious illness, a need related to physical or mental disability that is not otherwise accommodated. \nSPEAKER_05:  Travel went on official business of the body or another state or local agency. Emergency circumstances means a physical or family medical emergency that prevents them from... \nSPEAKER_05:  attending the public meeting in person. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the last one is the one that we're all the most familiar with. It's a state of emergency declared by the governor. Those are the super. \nSPEAKER_05:  virtual rules right everybody gets to be virtual we don't have to have locations open to the public \nSPEAKER_05:  The likelihood of this happening means that we're in another global pandemic probably or I've \nSPEAKER_05:  national pandemic and that's not great. So there is some legislation moving through to make meetings more accessible for not just commissioners, but there has been legislation passed for it to be accessible to the public too. So I'm sure next year I'll give you another presentation on the run it with those updates. \nSPEAKER_05:  So agenda items has to be a brief and general description of each item, includes the date, time, and location of the meeting, has to inform the public of the scope of the commission's intended plan, so the public can decide whether to participate or not. Must be posted in a location freely accessible to the public. \nSPEAKER_05:  public's right to comment. So the public can comment on any matter within the Commission's subject matter jurisdiction, even if it's not on the agenda. It's also known as non-agenda public comment. This is the one that comes up the most, where you hear me saying, like, please don't ask and answer questions, right? There's the most space in non-agenda public comment for you guys to violate the brown act, because if someone comes to the podium and discuss something that's not on the agenda, it's not fair to everyone else who wants to speak on that item, right? So... \nSPEAKER_05:  We can acknowledge, right, that's an issue is important to the community and add it to a future agenda so that all community members can come and participate and provide their feedback to the commission in an open public meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  The public must also be allowed to comment on regular agenda items. \nSPEAKER_05:  reasonable regulations, including time limits may be adopted. \nSPEAKER_05:  Time limits are typically adopted when there is a very large quantity of people and we want to make sure that all voices are being heard but we have a limited time. \nSPEAKER_05:  They have a right to record the meeting, photograph, audio tape, tape recorder, take photographs. They have a right to review agendas and other writings distributed by a majority of the commission and no secret ballots allowed. \nSPEAKER_05:  Disruptions, this one is new. \nSPEAKER_05:  So basically a disrupt disrupting a commission meeting or the council meeting is prohibited by the municode. It's subject to certain conditions. When we say disruption, we mean engaging in behavior during a meeting that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders it infeasible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. This is super important under the First Amendment. People do have a right to participate here, but there's a limit. \nSPEAKER_05:  right to that participation. \nSPEAKER_05:  It includes, it's not limited to \nSPEAKER_05:  Failing to comply with reasonable and lawful regulations adopted by the Commission under the Brown Act or any law like bylaws that you're going to have. Engaging in behavior that constitutes the use of force, a threat of true force. Conduct that may interfere with the rights of other speakers. So if someone's at the podium, someone keeps interrupting them and screaming so that they can't be heard by the Commission, that would be an example. Engaging in conduct that prevents the body from accomplishing its business in a reasonably efficient manner. \nSPEAKER_05:  knocking over the beautiful presentation that staff made for you guys, trying to knock over the podium, causing a physical disruption, yelling so that it's hard to hear what the chair and the commissioners are saying while they're doing business. \nSPEAKER_05:  And when we say true threat of force, that means a threat that has sufficiently \nSPEAKER_05:  has a sufficient indica of intent and seriousness that a reasonable observer would perceive it to be an actual threat to use the force by the person making threat. \nSPEAKER_05:  Basically \nSPEAKER_05:  very lorily way of saying that there is an actual threat, right? That a reasonable person in your shoes would think that harm is going to come if something isn't done, right? Not just like, I'm in a slug Tony. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? It's like Tony and the energy right where I'm angry it seems like I can't be calm down. I'm starting to approach Tony and aggressive body manor. Like at that point there's a true threat of forest right? No, I'm not doing Tony's like getting really uncomfortable. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for being there. \nSPEAKER_05:  crushed us on me. \nSPEAKER_05:  So what do you do? \nSPEAKER_05:  Under the Munich Code you're required to warn first. \nSPEAKER_05:  The presiding officer can be the chair of vice chair whoever is running the meeting must first warrant a disruptive person that their behavior is disrupting the meeting that failure to cease their behavior can result in removal. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sorry, you know, you don't have to apologize, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  person in the room. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  Please stop the disruption. We can't continue the meeting. There's a way to do it. We polite to not inflame the situation. So in the situation where there's a use of force or true threat of force, you're not required to give a warning. \nSPEAKER_05:  Once a warning has been issued, then the disruptive person can be removed the meeting. I hope we never have to use this, but this tool is available to you. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh... close sessions \nSPEAKER_05:  This doesn't really apply to you. It exists. I'm gonna breeze through this part, but basically there is an option. It's mostly for bodies that make quasi-judicial decisions in city council. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  to meet behind closed doors, but the result of those meetings has to be reported out. They're codified and examples are here. \nSPEAKER_05:  And... \nSPEAKER_05:  And the agenda still has to be clear on what the category is for the exemption under the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  And everything that happens there is confidential. The people that are included in the meeting are also limited based off of the topic of the closed session. So for example, for counsel, some chiefs of staff are not allowed. The only the attorneys from my office that are handling the matter really go to those meetings, right? \nSPEAKER_05:  It's very limited. \nSPEAKER_05:  violations of the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, we jokingly refer to this as Brown Act jail. It is a misdemeanor. \nSPEAKER_05:  to violate the Brown Act and civil action can be brought against you. \nSPEAKER_05:  to prevent future actions, costs and attorney fees, which can be quite expensive, can be awarded to the successful party. \nSPEAKER_05:  Be mindful of these rules. I'm available for questions. I think that's the end. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then I plan also to bring a separate presentation about motions for us to have a space to talk through what that looks like. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know that that's been an issue for this commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you so much for that presentation. Very helpful. Although I received training in this when I was on boarding, I think having it displayed as you said in person is not just helpful in general, but in terms of their attention and as a reminder. So thank you for that. I do want to check in with the public as usual and then we'll move over to the commission for any questions or comments. Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_03:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number five in person, please line up at the podium at this time. \nSPEAKER_03:  See you next time. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then if there are any members of the public in the Zoom, that would like to speak on item number five. Please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  fellow commissioners, any questions or comments on the presentation? \nSPEAKER_02:  I see Commissioner Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's a short question. Listening to Hubbins' book. \nSPEAKER_06:  Would you call that whipping the vote? I mean, it sounded like \nSPEAKER_06:  It's against the brown egg to whip the boat. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Have you? \nSPEAKER_06:  Told Mrs. Pelosi this. \nSPEAKER_05:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  Their rules might \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know, yeah, I can't speak. I don't have legal authority to help her. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  But if I call everybody to make sure that I have the vote, for example, a council vote. \nSPEAKER_06:  on something that I'm proposing. \nSPEAKER_06:  And is that against the Brownette? \nSPEAKER_05:  You as a commissioner. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, I may tell the law \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if you're a council member and you do that, it's a problem. If you're a commissioner and you do that to all the people on this body, \nSPEAKER_05:  That's a problem under the brown egg. \nSPEAKER_05:  You can't wear clothes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, today's a new day. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, yeah, because all of the things are supposed to be happening out here on the dius. \nSPEAKER_05:  right so that the public can participate. \nSPEAKER_05:  If they're happening in secret, that defeats the purpose of Shana. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would never call her and let a vote get called if I didn't know I had the votes. \nSPEAKER_06:  And you're telling me that illegal? \nSPEAKER_06:  end of the video. \nSPEAKER_06:  around like this. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  It end is a sorry if I'm taking too long, but it's the brown act just California. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  So other states have versions of that law? \nSPEAKER_05:  Great. \nSPEAKER_05:  But it's just California. \nSPEAKER_06:  to New Year's meow! \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Gamacho. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry to be that person again, point of order. Do you still have to take a motion? I know it's on the screen, but I'll only take the motion in second for the discussion. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's a motion in a second. \nSPEAKER_01:  electronically we do that. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Eating coffee. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, so let's go through the formality sake. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I'm going to go ahead and move forward. I'll just check in real quick. So let's move forward. Is that correct? Okay. Commissioner Gutiores made the first motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the second would be Commissioner Camacho. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so at this point we can proceed with discussion. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Gamacho, did you have an additional comment or just wanted to clarify the fixed bill litigation? Commissioner with the others? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. So, a couple of questions. First one, so the communication and like the serial communication. \nSPEAKER_04:  all of those different. \nSPEAKER_04:  communications that would violate the Brown Act. That's if we're discussing agenda items in particular. \nSPEAKER_04:  is that correct? \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  its commission business. \nSPEAKER_05:  So really anything before the subject matter jurisdiction of the commission, I used agenda items because that seems to be more tangible. \nSPEAKER_05:  But in planning for an agenda item, I'm like, okay, I'm going to bring an item. \nSPEAKER_05:  at the next meeting, but in three meetings, we're gonna bring your item. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bardering, I guess, with other commissioners. Like, if you support mine, I'll support yours. And doing that with each of the commissioners, right? You could do that before an agenda item came before the commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  got it. And then to clarify, I can call the chair and say, \nSPEAKER_04:  There's a community group who is really passionate about this issue that has happened. Can you agenda this? That wouldn't be a violation of the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, so having a one-on-one contact with the chair isn't a problem, but then, right, as the chair being mindful of not... \nSPEAKER_05:  How many people that information is being shared with? So maybe sharing with the vice chair? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  right? But not. \nSPEAKER_05:  sharing with so many people on the commission that you now a majority is aware. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right, and there's a consensus for again. \nSPEAKER_04:  the item. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, and then one more question related to this is in the past, the chair and vice chair. It happened when I was chair, when Amy was chair, it was a practice to do one-on-ones with your commissioners, not to talk about commission business, but to check in with commissioners on how they're, especially with the newer commissioner, right? How they're doing, what they need is, you know, is there any kind of technical assistance that could be provided, but it would be usually like the entire commission you'd end up talking to, having a similar type of check-in, just want to clarify if that's allowed. Now that there's a new chair, because like I said, that's the practice previous chair is used to do. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, that's okay. Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  But if you're getting into every time you talk to them, you're talking about a specific right item of commission business to now where everybody's on the same page about something that hasn't come before the commission yet, that's where there's a problem, right? For writing that assistance in and of itself is not. \nSPEAKER_04:  coisa lemon es \nSPEAKER_04:  God. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, in the past sitting we would, before we had a roadmap, some of the questions would be like, what are you interested in and things like that, where I could see now that we have a roadmap and priorities that could maybe get a little messy. Okay, and then one more question about the \nSPEAKER_04:  the location. So in the traditional \nSPEAKER_04:  I forgot what it was called, but if you need to take a meeting virtual and under the traditional roles and you have to notice it and all of that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you be in the commissioner who's needing to be a virtual? Can they be in a different state? Yes. OK. \nSPEAKER_05:  And theory could be in a different country, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  We have the problem of \nSPEAKER_05:  The clerk's office has to coordinate with wherever you're going to be. TID has to make sure that the technology is going to work. Just enjoy your vacation at that point, right? \nSPEAKER_05:  or ask the chair if you can move whatever the item is that you feel is so important that you need to be there for to another meeting right so that you can participate in \nSPEAKER_04:  What was the problem with your letters?lardan \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. And then I like, I actually have one final question. Who would bring the Brown Act suit? If somebody violated the public. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  And they do. Okay. Yeah. And they have. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  they \nSPEAKER_05:  Usually we find out by complaint to my office that there's a brown act violation, but they can bring an action \nSPEAKER_05:  they can bring an action on their own. Got it. Yeah. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Coveington. \nSPEAKER_05:  microphone please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you Chair, regarding Sierra meetings. \nSPEAKER_01:  You're only a violation if you meet or surpass Quorum, correct? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you talk to seven people, \nSPEAKER_05:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  and they don't talk to anybody else, that's not in violation to the brown. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  In this particular commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  in theory, but that's a lot of trust to put in seven beats, six other people. \nSPEAKER_01:  Cool. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think the reason why I asked is to not \nSPEAKER_01:  Detour us from having conversations, however, not having conversations for the purpose of like moving a boat forward, like yes, have conversation with your fellow commissioners, but don't go with any within 10 of moving an agenda forward. And don't let the brown act. \nSPEAKER_01:  to turn you from that either because \nSPEAKER_01:  The conversation meeting up to this, it was like, we don't talk at all. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, and that is not what I'm saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  What I'm saying is you should be a lot more thoughtful or you should be thoughtful. \nSPEAKER_05:  about who you're talking to and about what. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? And so I know um talk to a friend from another jurisdiction. They keep little trackers. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  of the types of issues that they talk about and who they talked to about it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? \nSPEAKER_05:  And then they'll go, hmm, I'm at Brownack. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right, and there's a culture of that. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so it's just being thoughtful and respecting that the public has a right to participate in this. I'm not saying do not talk to each other. That's not the point. It's being thoughtful about how many people that you're talking to. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I guess in the Huffins spoke example, if it's less than a quorum. \nSPEAKER_05:  in theory that's okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  But really those types of things, discussions should be happening so that the public can participate, and that's the point of the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  And an example specific for this commission is our ad hoc committees. Our ad hoc would be less than Corum, which then you could speak to that specific agenda item. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the purpose of developing out for the full commission to vote on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. So the ad- the ad hawks is less than a quorum. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then... \nSPEAKER_05:  because it's for a limited purpose. Like ad hocs, we have to be careful, right? So we can talk about it more on the ad hoc item, but not having you guys on multiple ad hocs, because \nSPEAKER_05:  There starts to be a Venn diagram of the overlap of subject matter where it gets very hard for you to track. Who you're supposed to be talking to about what? It's better for you guys, for you to work on \nSPEAKER_05:  One issue at a time. \nSPEAKER_05:  right? And \nSPEAKER_05:  to prevent that opportunity for a violation of the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  acted \nSPEAKER_02:  The only thing that I will add is... \nSPEAKER_02:  because we are often \nSPEAKER_02:  nominated or when we apply to be on this commission because we're really involved in our community because we have a lot of passion for community so oftentimes \nSPEAKER_02:  we will run into each other at events, whether it's a community social event, whether you know any event, I'll just keep it very broad. So I think having had this presentation also sends a just a reminder of it, it's so easy in social settings to just, hey we have a meeting next we will have you and so I think being mindful of this as well is mainly added to sense because we do run into each other a lot and that's a good thing right and we're social, we're involved with me and it's just so easy to talk about a number of things so I think that's one of the reminders that I got from here from this presentation so thank you. At this point unless there are further comments from the commission I'd like to call for a vote and the specific motion was to receive and follow the presentation of the Brown Act. Madam Clerk, \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_03:  We can do a verbal. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, motion is carried. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you Madam Clerk. And we're machine progress here. So just want to note that I do want to do a quick check-in with this being appropriate time to go back to the table in the discussion. Perfect. Let's do that first before we move on to the next agenda item. \nSPEAKER_05:  So item number three. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had to go back to landing number three correct. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  on, while the technology \nSPEAKER_04:  The technology team brings up the roadmap."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  next agenda item for us, item six, and we table till now jump into six. \nSPEAKER_02:  Recommendation to receive and file a report from current ad hoc committees. Discuss anticipated ad hoc committees for upcoming projects. And if appropriate, take action to dissolve or create ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now for context purposes, this is one of the agenda items that was rolled over from I want to say the meaning back in \nSPEAKER_01:  June that it will get to so it was tabled over to this meeting and for additional context I am going to ask Commissioner Gutiales to share reporting of the ad hoc meeting where we're at and then go into discussion \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you chair. So just a really quick report. We after the last meeting, we decided actually we, actually after our meeting in May, we decided that we were going to ask the Office of Equity to put together what they put together today. So that was part of last month's report. So I didn't need to share that last month. So and then we decided that after today, after being able to narrow down to those priorities using the sticker dot voting, that our task was complete. And so we would be recommending to dissolve the roadmap ad hoc committee. I realized I just raised some questions in the last item around. Do we need further clarification or \nSPEAKER_04:  input on some of these priorities. \nSPEAKER_04:  We may, but I don't necessarily think that we need to do that as an ad hoc. That could be something that the entire committee commission can discuss. Maybe at one more meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that would be my recommendation. I don't know if I have to make a motion for that, but we're recommending the ad hoc committee is recommending to be dissolved. So that's the first part of the update. The other part of the update is we were going to ask Deputy City Attorney to share some considerations around an ad hoc committee kind of system in general. Should we do those two things separate? Because I'm reading the agenda item and there's several components to it. \nSPEAKER_03:  So when you decide to vote, \nSPEAKER_03:  Part of that vote would be to dissolve the road map and Hawk Committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then... \nSPEAKER_03:  I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll put a pin in that idea, right? While we discuss, or you discuss, \nSPEAKER_03:  whether or not in this space you're creating ad hoc to move forward or if you need to have an additional discussion about what you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're right in the sense that \nSPEAKER_03:  the priorities that you've chosen are very large priorities. So nearing the scope of that, maybe with an agenda item at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a full discussion of the commission. As far as the ad hoc structure goes, I recommend that you guys continue to keep an item with language similar to this on your agenda if you're gonna operate with the ad hoc structure to keep track of all of them. \nSPEAKER_03:  You have a lot of work that you're trying to do. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, so... \nSPEAKER_03:  allowing a space for the ad hawks in one item to do a quick report on what they're working on and the progress of \nSPEAKER_03:  the work that they're doing. I think is incredibly important to keep track of. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  I \nSPEAKER_03:  If an ad hoc feels that they need a full discussion of the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  It should be a separate agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  right to give space for that. This is a general update of, hey, I think we have a couple more meetings to go. Or, oh, we're nowhere close. \nSPEAKER_03:  We still have a lot of work to do. We're finding the middle. You know, it's a space to allow communication, but not necessarily discussion on policies. Once the committees, once the ad hoc are ready to come back. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's an agenda item. It's a full discussion of the commission. It's hopefully a report from the ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_03:  with a recommendation on where this body should go. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  And then like I said before, I strongly recommend that you limit \nSPEAKER_03:  participation to one ad hoc at a time. You have a larger body, so you do have some discretion on how big your ad hoc can be. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  I, in my experience, I've seen usually about three members tend to be incredibly productive. Depending on what the type of work is, you can do more than that because COREM I think is eight. \nSPEAKER_03:  but thinking about the type of work that you want to accomplish. So we come back to the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  thinking about what that work looks like, how you as a body wanna break the work. \nSPEAKER_03:  into smaller digestible pieces so that things can get done. And what those ad hoc's would look like. Are you going to take the top two priorities and work on them at the same time? Are you going to break the number one priority into multiple smaller pieces? And different ad hoc's are working on those pieces and you come together as a body to create one giant picture. I think you have a lot of options. I think another discussion about \nSPEAKER_03:  taking up the first priority and how you guys want to work on that as a body. \nSPEAKER_03:  is something that you \nSPEAKER_03:  I recommend that you consider. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Does that clarify? Yes. Add Hone is a lot of information. Very, very, very helpful. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, that's what I was looking for. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, and then I want to, and I see, I'm coming to share a vice chair coming to As requesting to speak I want to share one more update. Oh, okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh yeah, that's weird. Okay, so I want to share one more update. Also just reminding the group that we in May voted to establish the recidivism ad hoc committee, but we put on hold appointing members to that ad hoc committee which I \nSPEAKER_04:  recognize that that's not a practice that we want to get in the habit of right when we establish at hot committees we want to \nSPEAKER_04:  identify the members of that ad hoc committee then and there. \nSPEAKER_04:  So just wanted to put that on our radar as well that that's a ad hoc committee that needs to be filled. So with that my motion is to dissolve the roadmap ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's also to keep the standing item on the agenda at our future meetings, the standing item around ad hoc where they can give quick reports on progress. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then the third would be to \nSPEAKER_04:  put in place that recidivism at heart. \nSPEAKER_04:  Or is that not to be in the motion? \nSPEAKER_03:  So the \nSPEAKER_03:  You can put that in the motion. The only thing that I would ask this body is, where does recidivism fit in the priorities that you just adopted in the prior item? And whether or not you need to have a larger discussion. If you're ready to create that ad hoc, \nSPEAKER_03:  and whether or not \nSPEAKER_03:  um, positivism can be \nSPEAKER_03:  couched under one of your other priorities or not. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thank you for that clarification. And we did call out when we had that item in May. We did identify where it is a part of the racial equity reconciliation. And so we did \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't have it in front of me but in our May agenda it calls out what \nSPEAKER_04:  under which goal and strategy or strategy and goal, it is couched under. So do you want to make sure everyone's aware of that? Okay, then I'd like to, okay, scratch that motion. I think it would be best for us, at least for the ad hoc committee or for this item. I'd recommend then disolving the ad hoc and then keeping the standing agenda item. And then I would actually defer to the chair, vice chair, about how to move forward as far as how we narrow down the scope and whether the recidivism ad hoc is appropriate at this time or if that's something we decide at the next meeting. So then mine's just the two. Disolven and keep the standing item. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Clark, do you? \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you need that repeated back? Are you okay? \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm okay, I'm gonna capture it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, so since you meet a formal motion, commissioners, the others, I'm going to call for a second. And then we'll go through discussion. Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_01: \ufffd \nSPEAKER_01:  Butler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Did I get that? So... \nSPEAKER_03:  So, all right. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Gutierrez. \nSPEAKER_03:  Madam Chair, can you clear it? Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can you? \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay sure good here is can you cue on your thank you \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Butler, now, Trey. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, so I have Commissioner Jellett or Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to be sure about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Second. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we have a second. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I'm gonna ask Madam Clark to call for public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing no members of the public in person, so none in person, and then if there are any members of the public in the zoom That would like to speak on item number six. Please use the raise hand feature now or dial star nine if calling in \nSPEAKER_02:  seeing none. \nSPEAKER_01:  The only comment that I'll offer now is \nSPEAKER_01:  much of what Commissioner Gutierrez articulated, I was actually thinking in terms of the racial conciliation framework, jump.me as a connection. I don't know the language in and out the London entire document, but I will memorize specifically, but I'm confident in not only your comments, but considering the framing of the document that this would have all under that. So I think this would be a space. And should the discussion go in this direction and if there's interest today, I don't think I don't think I \nSPEAKER_01:  we necessarily \nSPEAKER_01:  Should have to wait if there's interest already amongst three if there's already three people interested in that We could do that as a second perhaps a motion just as a thought So I'll leave it at that for now and see where the discussion leads us fellow commissioners. Chris here. I've got him done \nSPEAKER_00:  in regards to the recidivism at Hawk Committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  me or can you not hear me or chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. In regards to the recidivism at Hawk Committee, I know that we had two commissioners who were interested in leading that. It was Commissioner Allen and former vice chair Erickson. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think \nSPEAKER_00:  What I would want to recommend is that we hold off on the discussions of the adhocs for \nSPEAKER_00:  until September when everybody is here and we're regularly scheduled that way we can get a sense of who's interested in what and which ones we want to move forward. I don't necessarily feel comfortable deciding on whether the \nSPEAKER_00:  recidivism at our committee should be. \nSPEAKER_00:  Fold it into the reconciliation one or to like figure out where it lands, especially with Commissioner Allen not being here. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much for those comments. Any other comments, ideas, questions? \nSPEAKER_01:  So we'll forward with the motion. Madam Clerk, can we call for a vote? \nSPEAKER_02:  Motion is carried. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much. And we're going to go ahead and move on."
