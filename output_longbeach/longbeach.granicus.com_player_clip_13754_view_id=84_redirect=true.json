We have our former city attorney, Mike Mayt, as a retired annuitant this evening. So thrilled to have him here. And thank you for your service this evening. I know we have a couple of folks traveling with the summer season and we're awaiting a new appointment. So we're glad to have a quorum of the commission with us this evening. We have a busy agenda. So we'll get to that shortly. But first I'm going to pass it over to our senior historic planner Alejandro Placencia to talk a little bit about a recent case that's actually gone up to the state related to historic recognition here in the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. My name's Alejandro Placencia. I'm here in the Planning Department here in the City of Long Beach. So tonight in your packet, you have a nomination that was forwarded over to the State Historic Resources Commission. And the nomination is for a California point of historical interest, which gets approved by the California State Historic Resources Commission. What the nomination is for is for the National Surfing and Paddleboard Competition in 1938 that took place here in Long Beach. The areas in the nomination, which are in your packet, are really sort of roughly bounded by south of Ocean Boulevard between Pine Avenue and Chestnut Avenue and going south towards the lighthouse. So we're really talking about what was the former waterfront here, obviously, if we're talking about surfing and paddle boarding. But that's generally the area that we're talking about. It's previously before the waterfront was changed. It was the area that was between the former rainbow here and also the Pike and Musement Park. So that area was sort of just a little nook where the competition actually took place in a popular surfing destination here in Long Beach and paddle boarding. \nSPEAKER_00:  Currently, as this commission is well aware, there's no integrity, there's no contributing resources former in that area any longer. The waterfront's been substantially modified. There's been infill that's taken place. The area that we're roughly talking about currently is the Pike area. As we know, the Pike Outlets, the movie theater, as I mentioned, just kind of going down towards the lighthouse. Why this nomination is important, recognizes the location of LA County's first nationally-build competition, observing and powderboarding here in LA County and specifically in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  This is only an informational item tonight. The action was already taken at the state level, so there's no action that needs to take place by CHC. This is just for the commission's information here. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Alejandro, and that concludes our Director's report. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think it's a great thing that they did that. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have the first item on the agenda, please. Oh, do we need to... \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll make the motion to approve the recommendation to receive and file a presentation to recognize the California point of historical interest, nomination of a site of the 1938 National Surfing and Paddleboard Championships. \nSPEAKER_03:  Second merely seconds to end.

Next item on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_04:  Recommendation to approve a certificate of appropriateness and adopt the proposed findings and conditions of approval there to to allow for temporary removal Preservation and relocation of the historic Dolly Warden rooftop sign which is a locally designated historic landmark sign located at 335 Pacific Avenue in the downtown plan Plant development district as part of a separate site plan review and titleman application The site plan review and titleman which is not before this body or the subject \nSPEAKER_04:  of this item is to allow for the demolition of the existing hotel building for the purpose of construction of constructing a new 141 unit multifamily residential building with parking and resident amenities spaces within an eight story structure and two levels of below grade parking at 335 Pacific Avenue. The historic sign would be relocated to the new rooftop amenity space at 335 Pacific Avenue District 1. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Do we have a staff report? \nSPEAKER_13:  It's one of the project planners, Maryanne Cronin, will provide this evening's staff report. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. Good evening, Chair and fellow commissioners. The project before you today is a certificate of appropriateness request at 335 Pacific Avenue, which is the location of the Dolly Vardin rooftop sign. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide provides a short overview of how we got to this hearing today. And that starts in May 30th of this year for which the application before you was presented as a certificate of appropriateness for the temporary removal and preservation and relocation of the historic landmark sign, a top a new building, a multifamily building that would be approved as part of a separate site plan review application. \nSPEAKER_10:  At the conclusion of that hearing and public testimony, the CHC continued this item to a date uncertain to allow for time to do additional analysis that is included in the public comments as well as the transcripts for those previous items. On June 27, staff did conduct a study session in response to that continued item. As part of that study session, Department of Parks and Recreation Form, or analysis, did it analyze the existing three story building, its relevance related to landmarking of that building, which is not included as part of the current landmark ordinance, as well as the maintenance of the landmark designation on the historic rooftop sign, among other topics including the murals on the elevations of the buildings. At the conclusion of that June 27, 2023 meeting, the study session was recommended to receive and file. The recommendation that was outlined in that analysis was that the existing three story building did not meet the criteria for landmark designation, but that the rooftop sign did remain eligible as a local landmark. \nSPEAKER_10:  As a result, today's agenda item is to reopen the public hearing for the Cultural Heritage Commission's consideration of the certificate of appropriateness application for the temporary removal preservation and relocation of the sign on the replacement building at the project site. \nSPEAKER_10:  I will go through all the slides that were initially presented for the benefit of those that weren't here at the same level of detail. So this slide is shown for reference to the project site that's subject to this application. The project site is located at 335 Pacific Avenue, which is located on the west side of Pacific Avenue between 3rd Street and 4th Street. Presently the site is developed with a 3 story 35 room hotel, as well as a surface parking lot that includes 44 surface parking spaces north of the building. This building was constructed in 1929, and the Dollyvarden rooftop sign does sit atop the 3 story building. In 1995 a landmark ordinance did landmark the rooftop sign, but explicitly excluded the building that was underneath the sign. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide shows the existing murals that were painted on the building in 2015, which weren't visual on that aerial image. In addition, you can see the form of the building as well as its current condition. For reference, the artists that have painted the murals in 2015 as part of the powwow program at that time, which is now called Long Beach Walls, are James Jean and Tristan Eaton, who this is one of the first mural program participants in the powwow program. As you can see, the rooftop sign is visible in this image, and it does sit approximately 9 feet in height as far as extension above the roof line. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide shows additional up close perspectives as well as perspectives from the street of the historic rooftop sign. The rooftop sign is anticipated to have been placed up atop the building in around 1933 as part of repair work after the post earthquake repairs. The sign consists of two metal panels of neon lettering each position in a diagonal fashion. On the front of the roof and joined at the corners in the shape of a V. \nSPEAKER_10:  The sign reads Dollyvard in Hotel, Bath in every room. The letters are illuminated in blue and red neon colors, and the red neon is limited to the world word hotel, while the remainder of the sign is in blue neon. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide shows the fastening of the existing sign on the roof. The structural base of the sign are painted white. This sign, as it is today, did undergo preservation and was reinstalled at the top of the building not too long ago. \nSPEAKER_10:  The rooftop sign is, this is a slide that shows a little bit of information about the historic landmark ordinance. It was designated as a historic landmark on August 2, 1995, and it was found to feature notable design of the period and for its charming nostalgic message and visual impact to the downtown area. It is important to note that the landmark nomination documents include background information related to the protections provided by the landmark designation, including a statement that the removal and relocation of the historic resource could be potentially considered as non-adverse as long as it's relocated at the top of a new sign. \nSPEAKER_10:  As I had mentioned before in 2014 the sign was removed and restored and reinstalled back on top of the hotel and its current location and condition and did receive in 2015 a Longby Charitage Preservation Award for this Restoration Award. \nSPEAKER_10:  On December 20, 2022, this application did come in as part of a site plan review application to clear the site, remove temporarily the sign during construction, do any necessary preservation work and reinstall that sign on the rooftop amenity of a new amenity area of a new eight story, 141 unit multifamily building with subterranean parking. And as I had mentioned before, that concluded with the project being presented in May of May 30 to the CHC body based on that project history on the previous slide. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide does provide a brief overview of the subsequent analysis that occurred at the study session that was held last month. And that study session did include the consideration of a DPR form or a Department of Recreation form that was prepared by an individual, a consultant of the city pursuant to the professional qualification standards of, \nSPEAKER_10:  the requirements for doing that analysis. The consideration did include comments verbally raised as well as written comments during both the public comment period of the initial CHC hearing as well as part of that study session. \nSPEAKER_10:  at the conclusion of that analysis and at the presentation before this commission, the study session resulted in a determination that the landmark sign remained eligible as a landmark structure as well as that the building below it, the three-story hotel room, hotel building did not have the criterion meant to classify that as a landmark structure under local ordinance. With that, the action did allow for the incorporation of additional analysis received during that study session into the Department of Parks and Recreation form, which is included in your attachments in this application packet before you today. And based on this direction, the application was re-agentized for this hearing to reconsider the relocation of the sign onto the new building. \nSPEAKER_10:  So therefore the project before the CHC is the treatment preservation and relocation of the historic sign atop the new building. This slide does show a rendering of the sign relocated into the design of the multifamily structure. As shown the side would be located on the rooftop amenity area and the overall height of the new building would be eight stories and height, but the rooftop amenity area is actually on the seventh story rooftop area. \nSPEAKER_10:  The packet that you have included actually includes revised plans from that May 30th hearing. And those plans were revised in response to comments received on the initial hearing body that included the visibility of the sign from the street level. In addition, the applicant did do outreach with the muralists. And as a result of feedback from the muralists has incorporated additional elements that are worth noting but are not necessarily within the purview of this certificate of appropriateness application. That includes on the upper right hand rendering you will see an additional mural area that was added in conjunction with the coordination with Tristan Eton who it was express sadness and the mural being removed but also was encouraging of a new opportunity to provide a replacement mural on their new building. Furthermore, at the ground level you'll see on the bottom left hand photo you will see an additional rendering of opportunities to incorporate public art which includes coordination with James Jean who has considered is more into sculpture items as part of art rather than replacement murals. And therefore there are opportunities within the overall design of the replacement building to incorporate those items into the overall design. And so it's worth noting that the coordination efforts as part of that study session were taken seriously by the applicant and there is a series of correspondence at the back part of this plan set that's included in your packet documenting that feedback. \nSPEAKER_10:  And in addition, you will see that the location of the sign is at the southern most portion of the site to enhance visibility of the sign from the ground floor vantage points. This slightly differs from the initial application, but was presented to this commission during the applicant's presentation in response to public comments received. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide shows the floor plan of the upper level of the rooftop amenity area. As you can see on the left, this illustrates the minor change that I had just verbally described that the applicant elected to choose. So as you can see, the historic rooftop sign and the initial proposal considered in May of 2023 was located on the left-hand side. \nSPEAKER_10:  As such, the applicant has elected to move it a little bit to the south, but still visible and projecting over the front of the building to ensure visibility from the parallel Pacific Avenue. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide illustrates the design intent of this application. And it's a three-dimensional diagram to show the relationship between the sign and the new building. The location of that rooftop sign is a portion building that is stepped down and massing, as well as the building envelope has been pushed back on that upper area. The intent of that is to really illustrate the location of the sign from the ground level. \nSPEAKER_10:  Based on public comment, the applicant is also prepared this diagram to illustrate some alternative analysis that went into the development of these plans. As previously noted, the downtown plan does have specific setback provisions to create street walls and activating uses. The project proposal on the left hand side is the project proposal under consideration. Setbacks and stepbacks in design were developed with the six-foot setback along this portion of Pacific Avenue as well as the minimum street wall that's trying to be achieved through that downtown plan. To demonstrate and provide an alternative design, to provide this sign at the lower three-story level, as you can see, the building would have to step back and as a result, and based on analysis that the applicant can elaborate on a little bit more, the floor plan would be directly impacted and you would result in approximately the loss of approximately 12 units as part of that. And the applicant is available and can speak to that effect. But we wanted to present this through public comment that was received about the placement options in relationship to the by-right allowed uses of the multifamily use on this property and the design standards and development standards. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide does provide an overview of the project timeline and has not changed since that initial presentation. As condition, the removal of the sign is directly conditioned to the start and completion of the project. Therefore, the certificate of occupancy of the building would be conditioned upon the restoration of the rooftop sign to the satisfaction of the Department of Development Services. \nSPEAKER_10:  The treatment procedures included in your packet do outline the deliverables, qualifications, and terms that will be used as part of the historic treatment program as part of this approval. \nSPEAKER_10:  conditions of approval furthermore confirm the procedures identified in the attachment including photographic documentation, professional qualifications, and safe storage of the sign during project construction are adhered to. Those do include attention to detail as far into bird excrement removal and including digital photos which may include video as well. \nSPEAKER_10:  As outlined in the findings included in your packet, this project would comply with all applicable requirements and standards including the Secretary of the Interior Standards outlined in your presentation materials before you. The relocated sign would maintain its character defining features would include its sign content and the relationship to the downtown skyline as one of the few remaining rooftop signs. The project does not propose additions or alterations to the sign which has been updated in your conditions of approval to be explicit based on public comment that there is no change to the sign copy authorized under this approval. Furthermore, the treatment and preservation as well as the storage of the sign during construction would adhere to all best management practices to protect the integrity of that sign. The project would have a net positive impact as the sign would be preserved and incorporated into the design of a new residential building while allowing for redevelopment of the site to provide much needed housing including covenant to affordable housing that is in the downtown Long Beach area. \nSPEAKER_10:  The relocation of the sign onto a new building was contemplated during the 1995 landmark designation document that is also included in your packet. As such, the design of the new building has intentional massing to enhance the visual sight lines of the historic rooftop sign and does meet all the required findings. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide does show, it enumerates a little bit of a lot of our conditions of approval that are included and I will go over them briefly just because it does come up small for the benefit of the public that are here. The project would be required to adhere to all conditions of approval, which includes material finishes to match the existing and documented pre-construction conditions, pre-construction documentation, a final historic treatment program prepared by a licensed professional maintenance program for the ongoing maintenance of the sign, after project construction to ensure that that landmark rooftop sign does last for an extended period of time for its life so it can continue to be a landmark sign. As I had previously noted, all of these approvals are contingent upon the approval of a site plan review entitlement and issuance of building permits. Finally, a historic consultant will be present upon all changing to the sign, including the removal, relocation, storage, and reintroduction to the rooftop element. And finally, a post, a pre-imposed relocation report would have to document that all conditions of approval had been adhered to as part of the project. \nSPEAKER_10:  Public hearing notices were mailed out as required by code and posted on site. All previously received correspondence for your reference is also included in your packet for consideration, including those received during the study session. Four additional public comments have been received in response to this required noticing for this hearing and are also included in your packet for reference. \nSPEAKER_10:  Therefore, with the required positive findings presented in the staff report and in this presentation, staff does recommend approval of the certificate of appropriateness subject to the conditions of approval included in your packet. \nSPEAKER_10:  This does conclude staff's presentation. The applicant is available for any questions that you may have. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Commissioners, do you have any questions or staff at this time? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I do thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi Commissioner Bowdeck. Thank you very much, Ms. Cronin. And Mr. Sandoval, I understand you were involved in possibly some of the other work. Ms. Cronin, it was an excellent staff report. And I appreciate all of the information that we received. I do have a couple of questions for the, I'm not sure who I'm there for. The first question is, can you confirm what the required setbacks are of the downtown plan and Pacific Avenue? \nSPEAKER_02:  Did you say six feet? \nSPEAKER_10:  On this side, on the west side of Pacific Avenue, it is six feet. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so that is evident in the site plan. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes, the building facade is pulled back six feet. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then in the 1995 staff report considering landmarking the sign, there was a sentence that was in the staff report and then you also mentioned it that said there could be could potentially be considered. \nSPEAKER_02:  an adverse impact of the sign, can you confirm that language again? \nSPEAKER_10:  It was noting that the relocation of the sign onto a new building could be considered as non-adverse But I can pull up the sentence if you just give me one moment \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. Do you like me to read? \nSPEAKER_02:  I was able to locate it. It's the removal and relocation of the historic resource could potentially be considered as not adverse. Yes. As historic objects may be salvaged by relocation. OK. Got it. \nSPEAKER_02:  So that provides us the opportunity to \nSPEAKER_02:  save but relocate the sign. \nSPEAKER_02:  correct, right? Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'd like to ask a couple of questions about the alternative site plan that was considered by the applicant. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you bring it up on this green? \nSPEAKER_02:  So that site plan, the alternative design analysis does not show the frontage of this property. \nSPEAKER_02:  330 cedar avenue as being flush with the property to the south. Is that because it's a new construction? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. And how much of a step back was there to incorporate the sign? Is that 20 feet, 10 feet? \nSPEAKER_02:  15 feet. So you set the building back six feet and then you stepped it back another, let's say, 15 feet and then you put the sign on there. Did you consider an alternative design analysis that kept the facade of the Dollybardon where it was? \nSPEAKER_02:  and kept the sign where it is and then built the other buildings around it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you speak into Mike? \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think there's a way to raise the podium. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, is that better? \nSPEAKER_06:  So we did not because we felt like that with lose, you really lose the sign within the building massing, we actually even feel that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Maybe if I can just speak a little bit also to like why we didn't feel that this was the best solution, we're stepping it down in this. \nSPEAKER_06:  this way I think in the mind. \nSPEAKER_13:  way. \nSPEAKER_13:  If I could just pause you for a second and state your name for the record, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Shore. My name is Ryan Keldar. I'm a studio 111. \nSPEAKER_06:  the applicant. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  So yeah, a couple of things, Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_06:  the first why we didn't \nSPEAKER_06:  I think it was suitable to build massing around the sign. We felt that the sign would get lost within the building. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would also say that with the stepping down. \nSPEAKER_06:  of the mousing that the sign doesn't really speak to the skyline that it currently sits. \nSPEAKER_06:  That was a big consideration with having it up on the roof deck. \nSPEAKER_06:  you know \nSPEAKER_06:  I feel like it makes sense also to just kind of take a step back for us and why we took on this project and \nSPEAKER_06:  kind of how we got to where we're at today. \nSPEAKER_06:  We went through quite a few different studies on this site. \nSPEAKER_06:  including looking at you know much larger units and doing fewer than 50 units and much larger units at \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  If you have less than 50 units, it becomes a staff level approval. \nSPEAKER_06:  to try and expedite the process, but ultimately felt that it didn't make sense to do larger units. \nSPEAKER_06:  So then we looked at doing smaller units and how can we maximize smaller units and still we are only \nSPEAKER_06:  landing at 70 units and \nSPEAKER_06:  We really felt like we wanted to maximize the housing units on this site. \nSPEAKER_06:  And also it didn't feel like those two studies were really making any kind of impact. \nSPEAKER_06:  or really signifying this project from any other project that's going in a downtown Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  Our client actually was \nSPEAKER_06:  had the foresight to propose micro units. And we thought that was really an exciting opportunity because for us, \nSPEAKER_06:  something that's missing in downtown and that we've \nSPEAKER_06:  mentioned previously on this that we think is really important. \nSPEAKER_06:  is a housing for missing middle and \nSPEAKER_06:  and micro units we thank for. \nSPEAKER_06:  really satisfies that and can really start to serve that. \nSPEAKER_06:  that \nSPEAKER_06:  housing group that isn't being served in downtown Long Beach. So having a micro unit means that you have a lower price point for a rental unit and really opens the door for people to \nSPEAKER_06:  to rent and downtown Long Beach, but it might not be able to rent some downtown. \nSPEAKER_06:  So going from that, so this stepping down on the massing, I think it also what it does then is it does reduce the housing units by by 12. \nSPEAKER_06:  which we're not really happy with. We would prefer to really maximize. \nSPEAKER_06:  the housing units and the micro units for the missing middle. \nSPEAKER_06:  But again, I really feel with the sign up on the upper level. \nSPEAKER_06:  It feels like it's back within the skyline. There's no building that's behind it and shielding it from the skyline. \nSPEAKER_06:  and it really sets the stage for a sign to be a part of the downtown. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you do it, skye? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, I appreciate that. I have no further questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  time for the public comment and did you have anything further to add to mine to whatever his been said so far before everybody steps up? \nSPEAKER_06:  I appreciate the question now. I think that's it for us. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, if you would like to speak on this item, please come to the podium, state your name. You would have three minutes, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Hello and good evening commissioners. My name is Janelle Kathleen Cronk and I am a resident of downtown Long Beach's District 1. \nSPEAKER_09:  I moved to downtown because of the Dollybartons. \nSPEAKER_09:  hotel, sign and building. \nSPEAKER_09:  When I was looking for apartments, I saw the Dolly Vardin sign and felt hope. \nSPEAKER_09:  like many of the people that were in the 1930s and 40s walking around the street and saw bath in every room. Wow, I'm a navy man and I just want to take a bath. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's where you get to go is the Dollyvard in Hotel. \nSPEAKER_09:  And now... \nSPEAKER_09:  Dolly Vardin, she can't be here. So this is a message on her behalf. \nSPEAKER_09:  It has come to my attention that I am to be demolished, that the sign which adorns me merits historical value, but that me, myself, as I stand alone, does not merit historical preservation or significance. \nSPEAKER_09:  Let me ask, if it's sign pointing north. \nSPEAKER_09:  points to the south. \nSPEAKER_09:  Does that sign merit any significance? \nSPEAKER_09:  If I am to be destroyed, my sign removed. Place the inch storage where I'll surely be safe. \nSPEAKER_09:  My sign returns to a building that is not me. Place high upon the street for none to see, but the new residents of what I used to be. \nSPEAKER_09:  but no longer am. \nSPEAKER_09:  The Dolly Vardin Hotel offers immediate housing solutions in the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_09:  Why destroy immediate housing solutions in the city of Long Beach? \nSPEAKER_09:  People need homes now. They need homes now. \nSPEAKER_09:  to say that downtown Long Beach is the void of \nSPEAKER_09:  Small housing solutions, the Dolly Varden is... \nSPEAKER_09:  The original micro unit, they are small, hotel room size. \nSPEAKER_09:  units that could be immediately deployed to help solve the housing crisis in downtown Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_09:  Now. \nSPEAKER_09:  10 to 20% of buildings. \nSPEAKER_09:  are named for women. \nSPEAKER_09:  So why not just tear another one of them down? \nSPEAKER_09:  Sincerely, Dolly Varden. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Another speaker. \nSPEAKER_07:  My name is Louise Ivers, I live at 1837 East 6th Street. \nSPEAKER_07:  I am the Vice President for Advocacy for Long Beach Heritage. \nSPEAKER_07:  I've already written you two long letters. This is the third time I've been before you pleading to save the Dollyvardon. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  It's a piece of history. \nSPEAKER_07:  Actually that alternate design looked a little better. The sign was never meant to be on top of an eight story building and it will be almost invisible from that. \nSPEAKER_07:  But \nSPEAKER_07:  The owner doesn't want to spend the money. \nSPEAKER_07:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  Anyway, we are losing a historic resource if this building is demolished. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  I totally dispute the findings of the so-called PhD. \nSPEAKER_07:  person who \nSPEAKER_07:  from Michael Baker who did the analysis of the building. \nSPEAKER_07:  And nobody has even said one word about all the information that I've found. \nSPEAKER_07:  The Dolly Vardin portrays the environment in an era of history. \nSPEAKER_07:  The overall feeling of the building still conveys its historic sense of a particular time. \nSPEAKER_07:  It retains its integrity of scale and massing, flan structure. \nSPEAKER_07:  and decorative materials. \nSPEAKER_07:  The general aspect of the hotel still looks the same as it did in historic photographs. We don't need any more photographs put in a lobby of something that was demolished. \nSPEAKER_07:  This is not an answer to anything. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  This building is one of the few remaining examples in the city, possessing the distinguishing characteristics. \nSPEAKER_07:  of a historical type. \nSPEAKER_07:  The Royal Hotel was cited in the report by the consultant. \nSPEAKER_07:  But it has been changed much more than that of the Dolly Vardin. The psychic temple on Broadway is from another period altogether, so it's apples and oranges, and its first story has been completely renovated. This is one of the few buildings in downtown that is pretty much intact. I did give you a photograph last time, I think, from the original newspaper article when the building opened up. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I don't know what happened to it, but it got swallowed up. No one seems to be looking at it. I didn't bring another one this time. But the building is almost exactly the way it was when it was opened in 1933. \nSPEAKER_07:  It's unique, it should be preserved, adaptively reused and not demolished. \nSPEAKER_07:  The sign, which is a historic landmark, will be barely visible to passers-by on the top of an eight-story building. It is presently one of the few buildings that still offers affordable housing in the downtown where many market-rate apartments have recently been constructed. \nSPEAKER_07:  At the very least, if it's going to be demolished, there should be mitigation money given to the naval, memorial, heritage association. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there anyone else in the public who wishes to speak? \nSPEAKER_12:  Good evening. My name is Sarah McCurran. I live at 335, Theater Avenue. \nSPEAKER_12:  One thing special about the Dalai Parton is \nSPEAKER_12:  is the billion itself. That's what makes it so special is because it's on top of its original buildings. \nSPEAKER_12:  If you put on a modern building, you might as well take this sign and put it on top of the city hall. \nSPEAKER_12:  I mean, that's the charm of it. \nSPEAKER_12:  of the sign and also the housing issue. \nSPEAKER_12:  That's not going to really solve our housing problem. We have buildings going all up along beach. They're not even filled. \nSPEAKER_12:  We have a parking issue in Long Beach. We don't have enough parking spaces as it is. People are double parking, side parking. \nSPEAKER_12:  This is just going to cause more problems with that infrastructure that we do not have. \nSPEAKER_12:  Like I said, I came to Long Beach. I saw the dolly bar in sign. I thought that was great. I left the building, the architecture, and it all fits together. It's not going to look right on a modern building. \nSPEAKER_12:  this sign was meant to be on that building. And so we need to keep it there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  A very new one, Christittiesement. \nSPEAKER_08:  Good evening commissioners, manual Valenzuela, executive director of Long Beach Heritage. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I just want to thank you for this opportunity. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think in any other scenario, it could have just been one meeting months ago, but I appreciate that the commission has been looking at this. \nSPEAKER_08:  for three months to ensure that everything's being done. \nSPEAKER_08:  in the appropriate way. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner of Bowdeck. \nSPEAKER_08:  I loved your train of thought. \nSPEAKER_08:  about the potential. \nSPEAKER_08:  for maybe salvaging the \nSPEAKER_08:  the side. \nSPEAKER_08:  to give it a little more context. Because... \nSPEAKER_08:  We need to be clear here. \nSPEAKER_08:  when the building is demolished. \nSPEAKER_08:  and our historic sign is placed on a new building. \nSPEAKER_08:  It is losing a lot of context. \nSPEAKER_08:  What does a bath in every room mean on a building built in 2024? \nSPEAKER_08:  Now this is going to sound kind of strange. \nSPEAKER_08:  We advocate for signs like the FNM Bank. \nSPEAKER_08:  sign or we advocate for \nSPEAKER_08:  advertising on the back of the insurance exchange building. \nSPEAKER_08:  because it provides context to the building. \nSPEAKER_08:  and I think we're saying the opposite. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think the building provides context to the sign. \nSPEAKER_08:  And if there's any sort of way \nSPEAKER_08:  to at least salvage the facade to ensure that a maximum number of units are still built to provide housing. \nSPEAKER_08:  and provide opportunities for people to live here. \nSPEAKER_08:  That's great. There must be some way to save. \nSPEAKER_08:  at least a front portion of the building. \nSPEAKER_08:  so that you get that context of, oh, okay, I see this. \nSPEAKER_08:  building connects to a building that used to be here in 1929. \nSPEAKER_08:  If we don't save the facade. \nSPEAKER_08:  then \nSPEAKER_08:  A person passing by has to go to the building. \nSPEAKER_08:  Go up to the top of the building. \nSPEAKER_08:  Walk to the sign and then probably read a little description of what that sign even means. \nSPEAKER_08:  But if we could save a portion of that facade where you can touch it, you can feel it, you can see the history. \nSPEAKER_08:  experience it. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think that \nSPEAKER_08:  helps reinforce why this sign was so important. \nSPEAKER_08:  I want to acknowledge \nSPEAKER_08:  Luis Ivers, our former CHC commissioner and vice president, Long Beach Heritage. \nSPEAKER_08:  who did outstanding work researching this. \nSPEAKER_08:  over a weekend. \nSPEAKER_08:  She does this for free and we really appreciate it. We're glad you're incorporating it. \nSPEAKER_08:  into the record of the consultants report. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I also want to mention that in the consultants report. \nSPEAKER_08:  It takes a lot from survey LA, right? So you get the context. \nSPEAKER_08:  of what that building is. But what was failed to mention was \nSPEAKER_08:  survey LA used that context that you were looking at. \nSPEAKER_08:  to save buildings. \nSPEAKER_08:  They're actually going to save similar buildings as a non-contiguous \nSPEAKER_08:  historic district. \nSPEAKER_08:  for as in this consultants report. \nSPEAKER_08:  It said, well, no, it's not the most important thing. So you can go ahead and demolish it. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think we're really losing a sense of who we are. \nSPEAKER_08:  The Dolly Varden was never intended to be on the city seal or be. \nSPEAKER_08:  and iconic building. It was really meant to provide a service that it did really well. And it has excellent \nSPEAKER_08:  features that still remain. So let's try to save what we can. \nSPEAKER_08:  so that we can still have maximum number of units and still show the history of the sign. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_03:  next person who wishes to speak. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do we have anyone on? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_11:  If you're joining us virtually and you would like to make public comment on this item, please use the raise hand function at this time. \nSPEAKER_11:  their appears to be in a further public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. There's no further public comment. I'll take it back behind the rail. Questions or statements from the commissioners? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry for a lot one last question. I'm looking at the proposed site plan. And it shows that there's an entrance plaza that is stepped back beyond the six feet. What is the approximate distance that that entry plaza is stepped back? \nSPEAKER_10:  I'll give this one a moment, we'll check the overall. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll see you next time. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  It looks approximately 5 or 6 feet at the deepest portion. \nSPEAKER_02:  the deepest point. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does any of the other commissioners have questions? \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner McGuire would make a few comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  On a previous item on the agenda, we approved a point of historical interest, the 1938 National Surfing and Paddle Board Championship. It's probably long overdue that this is being recognized, the fact that the Queen Beach did have waves at one point through historical photos. Yes, we did have waves. Now, it's a much different landscape. But my point is, again, we're discussing the sign, but also at the same time, the building comes up through the consultant and in term that there was really no historical significance. Louise Ivers, again, presented another letter of which she had done research in, quite frankly, Miss Woods from Baker International should have done this type of work as well. But it seemed to me that she was either not. \nSPEAKER_01:  talking to the right people are not doing the research necessary. But under criteria one in terms of significant character. Back in the 20s and 30s, Long Beach was a tourist destination. Hence we had surfing. We had the surfing championship. Middle class visitors stayed at the hotel. So that alone states what the purpose of that hotel and it exists today in its same character. Criteria C, no person of significance to the community. That is completely false. Leland Varlan, Barton. \nSPEAKER_01:  was on some of the most important boards in this community, the Citizen Savings Bank, with Charles Hartwell of Hartwell Park, CJ Walker of Farmers and Merchants Bank, and Frank Wengard, also a known pioneer. He also owned 20 acres on Signal Hill, so this guy was a man of vision and means. \nSPEAKER_01:  And Criteria D, the environment of the history of this particular project, again we have raised several buildings in the downtown area. But the good news is that we have preserved some such as the insurance exchange, the Crests loss, the Walker department store. Those are now significant buildings in our fabric that have been repurposed. Now the question is that the owner of this project wants to repurpose it with a demolition, so much of what they did with the Pacific Coast Club back in the 90s next to the Villa Riviera, which was also part of the coast. Now all I'm saying is that \nSPEAKER_01:  As one of the members of the audience alluded to, what good is the sign if we preserve the sign when the building is demolished? We put it on to a different building. What does that sign represent? To me, I would vote that \nSPEAKER_01:  Let's just trash the sign and put it in the store to sell for scrap because it's not preserving the history, the fabric of the Darlie Vardin hotel. I'm sure there could be more history to the fact of who was Darlie Vardin. What was her relationship to Leland, Varlin? Was she the mistress? We don't know. But the fact is, is that those questions were never answered. Now, when my colleague talked about the setback that we would use the third four, as a reference to placing the sign, yes, there'll be a loss of 12 units. That could be a significant hit to the bottom line to the developer of the 141 units. He's still going to do very well. My suggestion and somebody else alluded to the fact that \nSPEAKER_01:  If there is going to be a CEQA component to this project, which is an environmental review, and the loss of such a historical building to this community, that yes, maybe it'd be appropriate that we would have some mitigation in terms of, you know, both pictures as one person alluded to in some artifacts, but also a significant contribution to the Navy Trust in the name of preservation. That, to me, would be one resolution. It would probably discuss in another commission under the Planning Commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  but it might, my \nSPEAKER_01:  intention that \nSPEAKER_01:  We as a board. \nSPEAKER_01:  are trying to preserve \nSPEAKER_01:  the history of this community. And when the working ball does come about, it does take a piece of the community, the piece of history, and will never be replicated. A 1923 building will not be to look at the same as a 2023 building. That is my comment. It's really not a question to the architect or the developer. But as far as the sign itself, yes, it does have significance, but would it make any difference sitting on a six-story building? Not really, but I'm just one commissioner out of the roof. But thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Commissioner Vaughn. It was anything for the commissioners. \nSPEAKER_03:  Matthew, at this time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Brad. \nSPEAKER_07:  was published in 1841. I've read the book. \nSPEAKER_07:  and she's one of the major characters. \nSPEAKER_07:  There was a Dolly Vardin named after her, who was a circus performer. \nSPEAKER_07:  But that's no connection to the hotel. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Lee Wan Dali, whose name was spelled D-O-L-L-E-Y. \nSPEAKER_07:  Not D-O-L-L-Y. \nSPEAKER_07:  So he was the owner of the hotel. He must have liked Charles Dickens, that's just my guess. But that's who Dolly Vardin was. And actually there's even a trout named after Dolly Vardin a fish. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. There's a style of costumes from the 19th century that's also named after Tulsi Barton. So that's Tulsi Barton. Thank you. We've already closed. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  public comment. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this is a very difficult situation because our per view, because this building is not landmarked and does not come under our per view, only designed. So this is a very difficult situation because I think there's a lot of emotion attached to it. And certainly many of the comments that people have made that it lacks significance attached to a modern building and that there should be some kind of recognition and perhaps maybe the maybe historic memorial trust should benefit from it. There's a lot of different things that have been mentioned that I think need to be thought about. What happens with the building goes before the Planning Commission now and the SITES Plan Reviews. So seeing that, I think we need to make a motion to approve what we do have per view over, which is the C of A to adopt the proposed findings and conditions of approval to allow for the temporary removal preservation and relocation of the historic Dolly Pardon rooftop sign. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do I have a motion? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would like to propose an amended motion if I may. Yes. I would like to approve the certificate of appropriateness provided that the sign is in situ and that the first 12 to 15 feet of the building facade be retained and the sign can be temporarily removed, preserved, and then placed back on that portion of the historic Dollyvard and rooftop sign. I do find that there is the potential for an adverse impact with the complete removal and relocation of the sign. So with that, I would be ready to approve the C of A with that condition. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there anything that City Attorney has to do? \nSPEAKER_00:  to say. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm not quite sure that I understood exactly what you're asking the developer to do. And I think if that is the motion, the developer should be able to. \nSPEAKER_00:  or the applicant should be able to address the impact that that may have on the overall project. So that everyone is aware. \nSPEAKER_02:  Certainly, so I'm looking at photograph eight in the attachment. \nSPEAKER_02:  the primary record attachment. And Photograph 8 shows an aerial view, actually an oblique view of the brick building with the white \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't know what material it is, cement block, concrete block, a portion of the building that actually retains the sign on top. And I would like to see that the linear frontage on Pacific Avenue retained and approximately 12 to 15 foot depth of the building retained, which would align with the existing entry plaza. That's approximately 12 feet set back from the curb. \nSPEAKER_02:  and that would be my motion. So approve the certificate of appropriateness with that condition that the sign remain in situ. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think we understand here at the staff table commissioner about it, but I just want to further expand. So I'm looking at the same photograph that I believe you're referencing. And \nSPEAKER_05:  If there's... \nSPEAKER_05:  a wall of an adjacent structure, but roughly that area. \nSPEAKER_05:  That is. \nSPEAKER_02:  Roughly that area that's in white. \nSPEAKER_05:  that's in white would remain, but that under your terms of the approval of the COA, sort of what happens with the structure from that point back would remain in the purview of the planning commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm proposing that the rest of the building could be demolished and that it is a facadeectomy where the sign can remain incorporated into facade of the Dollyvardon. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you have that picture? How possible on the screen? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  commissioners did you want a second Miss Bodex commission of Bodex amended \nSPEAKER_01:  Are we clear on the motion or are there still needs to work? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, we're working on the motion, so I don't want to speak for the applicant, but I think it could have an adverse impact on the project, which is fine, but I think you need to give them the chance to address the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to finish my blind with second-hand motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we hear from the applicant, please? \nSPEAKER_06:  So I guess... \nSPEAKER_06:  a couple things. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think one thing that's... \nSPEAKER_06:  maybe not being shown as well as Eras. \nSPEAKER_06:  parking that's underneath this building for two stories so that \nSPEAKER_06:  does. \nSPEAKER_06:  significantly impact any parking that we're providing for the project. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  reducing. \nSPEAKER_06:  the parking, I actually don't know. \nSPEAKER_06:  without like a structural feasibility study how. \nSPEAKER_06:  We could do any subterranean parking underneath the existing building, but not to say that can't be completed. It would just add one. \nSPEAKER_06:  understand those structural implications. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  I do think it's... \nSPEAKER_06:  would be uh... \nSPEAKER_06:  a substantial redesign on. I think it's just as easy as just \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, keeping it there. I know you know that as well. I'm trying to overstep your... \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  You're not a \nSPEAKER_02:  You're not overstepping at all. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, it's \nSPEAKER_02:  So you need to put it on record. Yeah. Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_06:  you need to put it on. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I think there's a substantial. \nSPEAKER_06:  redesigned to the entire project that would have to happen. \nSPEAKER_06:  to maintain that facade. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, I do think it's at that point, it just becomes a completely different study. I think we would want to. \nSPEAKER_06:  at that point just go back to the drawing board and relook at this rather than trying to keep that and incorporate it into the existing design. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I also would say I still think that that does. \nSPEAKER_06:  kind of lose the sign would lose itself within the building and for keeping \nSPEAKER_06:  it works out and then folding a building completely around it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  and it does lose its context with a skyline of downtown Long Beach. Again, that was really the intent for the design was to have that sign celebrated up and keep it within the skyline of downtown Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I will say this that your comments resonate with me, that it would be lost in the massing of the building. But I do think that the long-term context would be retained and that would override the potential impact of the massing. But I do appreciate and understand what you were saying. This has been an extremely difficult one for me in particular because I do understand the necessity of providing as many housing opportunities as possible and I am a huge fan of development. But I also do firmly believe that the sign will be out of context if there is not a fragment of the building remaining. So I do have a question to staff is that our action is appealable. Was that correct? It's appealable to the planning commission. That's correct. All right. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm ready to call for the question. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be able to have anything further to add. \nSPEAKER_06:  now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you so much. And as has been mentioned many times, this is a very difficult situation and like Commissioner Bodeck, I also am pro-development and I do understand the need for housing here, but at the same time, a sign on the skyline is not significant on the modern building. So that's just my thoughts on it. And I hope that somehow, there can be a resolving of this issue that will. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know, there's no perfect solution. But can we go then to vote? We have our \nSPEAKER_03:  We have our second. \nSPEAKER_03:  can we go? \nSPEAKER_01:  One more thing before we call for the vote. \nSPEAKER_01:  Again, as my fellow commissioner, Ms. Bodeck, mentioned, that changing the dynamics of the building, the signage, it's just not the same. The new building will have a bath in every room, maybe, too, in each unit. But my concern is that the signage is just signage after that. The soul has been lost. \nSPEAKER_01:  in this building. And why put the developer if it gets if our motion approves and then planning overturns it and the developer goes and \nSPEAKER_01:  completes this project and \nSPEAKER_01:  The sign itself, as you know, would alter, you know, it would be insignificant sitting on top of a building. So it does retain some value in terms of what's on the skyline. It had some impact, but no impact today. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  I would probably further make a motion saying that well, if they're not going to overturn \nSPEAKER_01:  Our vote. \nSPEAKER_01:  why even preserve the sign. You know, my feeling is that for the money that they're going to spend on preserving that sign and putting it up on the property, they could easily spend that in terms of other mitigation measures for preservation in the future for this community. The Navy Heritage Trust Fund has contributed over $4.5 million over the last 20 years to preservation in this community. It all started with the mitigation grant through the Navy and the port. And my feeling is that the sign, unless you really have a passion for the sign, the mural had also, we had some significant concerns about the mural and what ramifications of demolition would be. \nSPEAKER_01:  Why put the developer through this hoops if really the building's going to be completely altered is going to be looking so much different and have this old sign sitting up on top of their building. So I don't know if we would want to alter that motion. But- \nSPEAKER_05:  I can make sure I just... \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm gonna cut you off there. Just for the sake of the record, there's been a lot of references to the Navy Memorial Trust and the grants that they make, and it's a wonderful organization, but it's... \nSPEAKER_05:  It's not a city controlled organization and there's no nexus under the mitigation fee act for us to assign some type of mitigation fee for preservation and then hand it to a third party organization. It would not comply with California law. The original funding of that was part of a lawsuit settlement. It was not a construed as a mitigation program of the city. So I understand the sentiment. I know where you're going, but that's not that first fall of being under the planning commission and second of all. \nSPEAKER_00:  but that's not the first fall. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's cool. \nSPEAKER_05:  The mitigation FIAC does apply and there's no next study connecting the impact of demolishing a building to paying into that third party organization. It was created by all the parties jointly as the result of the litigation about the Navy Supreme Court demolition. So that's not. \nSPEAKER_05:  What's in front of you? As a reminder, we also don't do hypothetical if and but motion. So I don't think on the staff table, we have any way to \nSPEAKER_05:  It carry out a motion that says this is what we're approving, but if a different body does X, then that changes our action. \nSPEAKER_05:  to be something else because that's something else then would be subject to another appeal again at the planning commission. There has to be finality to your motion. So I think you have to approve or deny with or without conditions the certificate in front of you. We're glad to forward your comments to the to the planning commission, but we seem to be getting. \nSPEAKER_05:  very far afield of what's actually on the agenda this evening. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can Commissioner Bodix, amendment stand then, or do we need to? \nSPEAKER_03:  Go band-oats. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mr. Bodex motion was fine and I would recommend \nSPEAKER_03:  it really! \nSPEAKER_05:  that you ask for any additional \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, amendments and the maker of the motion would have to accept those amendments and then you would take a vote on the resulting motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  for their any further amendments to this motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  And if not, then can we move forward with Commissioner Bodex, amended motion and vote, please? \nSPEAKER_05:  commissioners you can start voting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you so much. Thank you to everybody who contributed to all of their passion and love of \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Dickson the\u0438\u044e"
