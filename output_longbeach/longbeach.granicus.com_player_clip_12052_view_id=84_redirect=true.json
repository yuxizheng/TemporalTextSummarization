        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  back from the economic equity studies and community roundtables. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Excellent, I believe we have a staff report, John. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, ma'am. \nSPEAKER_00:  So Chair Mungo and members of the committee, thanks so much. I actually will give you a quick run through of the initial findings from the Economic Recovery Strategy Studies that we commissioned. So about. \nSPEAKER_00:  right about December, the Economic Development and Finance Committee met and recommended the City Council to do some community outreach, but also some economic research on what has happened over the last couple of months with regard to the relief and then transition of COVID-19 and how we can prepare our economy for recovery. And so Cal State Long Beach, our Office of Economic Research, Dr. Sajji Steinmetz and Robert Kleinhens. They are our primary economist expert for this department. We were able to secure a contract with the Employment Development Department of the State of California, and they were able to secure that confidential data to bring you today. Very recent employment and unemployment claim data for the City of Long Beach to give us a little bit of a context as to what has been happening, who has been most impacted and which sectors need the most help. So I'm going to go through about four or five slides to show you just a sample. These studies are actually very extensive. There's lots and lots of detail, but today for the committee to get the conversation going, I'm going to give you just an overview. So remarkably, this is an absolutely mind-blowing number over the past year from January to January. \nSPEAKER_00:  We've seen over 250,000 unemployment insurance claims in the city of Long Beach by residents of Long Beach. Now that includes pandemic unemployment assistance, which was the federal program to help out with gig workers and even small business owners of the panic contractors. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_00:  Ultimately, there were about 150,000 individuals who filed claims. In some cases had to file multiple claims because periods expired and things like that. And so that 250,000 number is roughly 150,000 individual long beach residents. So these numbers are absolutely mind boggling in terms of how they, how great they are on a historical basis. \nSPEAKER_00:  But to give you an example, we asked Cal State Long Beach to break this down in a couple of different ways. We have charts. So these tables that you'll see really provide us a lot of detail about employment, unemployment, you know, by sector in this case. And what these numbers will show you is a drill down on the sectors that were impacted the most. \nSPEAKER_00:  and ultimately how that number reflects the percentage of the overall work for us or how much of of of long beach workers are impacted by sector. And as you can see no surprises the things we've been talking about most. \nSPEAKER_00:  combination of food services, retail, trade, health care. These are by far the most impacted sectors, anything that's face to face. The other thing that Cal State Long Beach did for us, which is really neat, is that they were able to provide us with some maps. So we were able to look at density of unemployment insurance claims. Where were the job loss impacts happening? And you can see by these bubbles, 90810, 908.05, the biggest bubbles because of how many claims were filed in those particular zip codes. But I'm only giving you this as a sense to see that we took the council's direction and the committee's direction to really drill down and disaggregate this data to also look at where these residents live and which neighborhoods are impacted most. \nSPEAKER_00:  Another thing that we did in these economic studies that, of course, will provide to you in full detail at a later date, later this month, and will attach them to our final reports is the unemployment claims. When we look at the service occupations, so those service sectors that I was just talking about that were impacted so much, where do those residents live by census tract and we did heat maps. So not only the bubbles, but you can now drill down to census tract level. This is extremely detailed for a city, not just a major American city like Long Beach, but any city to get city-specific data from January of 2021. This is incredible that we get this this fast and in this level of detail, once again showing how Cal State Long Beach and Dr Steinman's and Dr Kleinhens are so responsive to the committee and the city council's needs. But we'll use this data as a way to really see where are residents who have lost jobs in the service sector specifically, where they live, where we might want to concentrate our investments in the recovery plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  In addition, we asked them to break down by race and ethnicity. We asked them to take a look at a lot of different intersections that the council had identified to see who's being impacted most when it comes to racial identity. And in this slide, you can see that \nSPEAKER_00:  the racial breakdown or ethnic breakdown of unemployment claims. \nSPEAKER_00:  It gives you not only the total number here, as an example, the Hispanic category is how it's described in the employment data. These are EDD or employment development department data terms. So Hispanic at 90,000 claims, that reflects about, you know, 36% of the total claims, but Hispanic workers are actually 42% of the workforce. So we get to look at how these employment claims and, you know, by sector, by geography, by race, and even by age and gender. So I have all kinds of data to share with you. I won't do that today. I just want to give you start getting, you're thinking about what kinds of research we have now available to us in that. We were very responsive to the questions that Council had asked us to explore. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, \nSPEAKER_00:  And then takeaways. So we ask them, hey, can you also just from your economists lens, give us some of your insights and takeaways about, you know, how COVID-19 recession has impacted Long Beach residents and workers. And there's some really interesting insights that they provide to us as economists. They look at the world a little bit different ways. And we like that because it helps us to think about the economy. Of course, we'll dig into that a little bit more, but I want you to know that we're in the process as staff of producing a memo that highlights. I'm not asking you to read all this fine print here, but I want you to know that we're now going to the point where we're going to be crafting a report back to this committee and to the community in general. \nSPEAKER_00:  Ultimately, people can. \nSPEAKER_00:  I get a sense of of of the detail, making it available to everybody. And I \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, these are the major themes that came out of the economist's review about equity. It didn't impact people or sectors or geographies equally. It was very different depending on your sector, your race, where you live. \nSPEAKER_00:  Public health is a key to this whole recovery vaccination of service workers in particular. Businesses, revenue generations, it's a heart of this, you know, this recovery and coming back and how can we as a city really stimulate \nSPEAKER_00:  revenue and help them to bounce back, rehire workers because that's where most of the jobs were lost. That's how we're going to bring back tens of thousands of workers is customer generation. How can we help to bring customers back, bring back demand, especially when consumers are afraid maybe to get out there and start spending on services again? How do we also leverage our resources as a government through stimulus or otherwise to catalyze private sector spending? And finally, digital connectivity is a thing, a theme that comes through all this stuff, whether it's applying for benefits, knowing about programs to help and support in the recession and so forth. So I'm going to stop right there. That is a little bit of a review. There are a couple of other studies that are wrapping up. One is a restaurant retention strategy. LAEDC is doing that with us in partnership with Cal State Long Beach. We also have a small business survey that's being completed by the marketing department at Cal State Long Beach. And then Tracy Colongan, the Office of Civic Innovation, completed an extensive ethnographic study of individual experiences, all the different intersections of age and race and gender and geography. And that is going to be a really wonderful study that I'll ask Tracy to come and present when \nSPEAKER_00:  that wraps up. But those are all paid for by CARES Act as part of our economic equity studies. Very visionary for our city and our department and the council to put money aside to do this work. And so now it's positioning us very well to strategize in the recovery. So that's a whole lot of information, but I'll turn it back over to you, Chair, and I'm happy to answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. I appreciate that. \nSPEAKER_04:  We are very fortunate that the council made the decision to set forward the CARES Act funding for the three studies. I know I look forward to having those agendas at an upcoming meeting. Now that we've gone through the round tables, I would love to hear from the community. If we have public comment and my council colleagues on the committee with some of the things that were important to them and I'll also share the things that I heard were important to the community. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, cheers. \nSPEAKER_04:  City Clerk, do we have public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, Chair, we have one person signed up for public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great, let's start with that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay? \nSPEAKER_01:  Jeremy Harris, you have three minutes. It begins now. \nSPEAKER_01:  Please unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_07:  Good afternoon, Chair Mungo, members Richardson and Alan Jeremy Harris-Lombi-Cheria Chamber of Commerce, President and CEO, appreciate the opportunity. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm calling in today just to reiterate the thanks on behalf of our members and leadership. \nSPEAKER_07:  of having the Chamber of Commerce involved in the process. \nSPEAKER_07:  from the roundtable discussions. \nSPEAKER_07:  We were able to hold three of those. \nSPEAKER_07:  with the help of Chair Mungo and of course, city staff. \nSPEAKER_07:  through John Keisler. \nSPEAKER_07:  and a range from small business to large. \nSPEAKER_00:  Storytelling Comment of Questions \nSPEAKER_07:  our leadership and our members and stretched across multiple industries. \nSPEAKER_07:  And we look forward to coming forth with several recommendations and the formalized letter before your council meeting. Today's opportunity is just to thank you and allowing business to be at the table during this very, very important process. And once again, thank you to Chair Mungo for leading those efforts. And I know members Richardson and Allen, you are involved as well. So again, thank you. And I look forward to submitting a more formalized letter of support from the business community and what our needs are truly across. The multiple sectors that we represent. So thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I know that John, you've gotten to spoke with each of us individually, but because of the new interpretation of Brown Act, it's been difficult for us as council members to be able to communicate with each other because that would be a violation. So I know that we've each taken a bit of time. \nSPEAKER_04:  to um \nSPEAKER_04:  review the videos of any \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  presentation that may have been missed, but also to hear from our community in many forums and to share that with you today of the things that are both important to us and our colleagues that we've heard out in the community. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I want to give an opportunity to discuss that before we do. I did have two questions on your presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I would love to see if we have any other additional questions on the presentation. On slide six, you included a infographic. \nSPEAKER_04:  you would be able to dive into the specifics and the details related to unemployment by precinct across the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  is that \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that available online for us to access? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, I'll count some members. Thanks so much. And in our next item, we're going to dig in deep on the community round table. So thank you for mentioning those as well. So we intend to post all of the economic equity studies online. And Nick Schultz, our director at Pacific Gateway, and really our economic data expert, he's been working directly with Cal State Long Beach to go through some of these different maps, understand them. And then we'll be packaging them and posting them online, as well as part of the final report. Meantime, I just want to point out that we do have census tract level data in real time for things like unemployment, American community survey data, Bureau of Labor Statistics data, on the economic development webpage, it's called the Economic Insights Dashboard. So we do have those available online anytime. And then yes, we will have this soon. Our goal is by the end of March. We'll have published our final report and posted everything for the public. \nSPEAKER_04:  Excellent. The picture on the left is something that you'd included in many of those roundtables, but the picture on the right is new. And so I know that you're constantly getting new information. On slide seven, you mentioned that you could dive into the details more. It's interesting to see how the Hispanic community and the white community were impacted at higher rates compared to other percentages. So unemployment claims of Long Beach residents \nSPEAKER_04:  from one section versus Long Beach workers. And so the workers and the resident numbers are not as in alignment as one might have thought. And so that's definitely some interesting information as well, because not all Long Beach workers are Long Beach residents. So also, \nSPEAKER_04:  I would love to see the gender numbers added. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know you and I kind of spoke about a presentation that was done by a women's group last week and \nSPEAKER_04:  some of the women brought forward statistics related to in a particular month. \nSPEAKER_00:  Ah, we want to put yourself there. I'm really looking forward to provide more of what's going to return to you when you're working towards.\u767a whole a time kind of \nSPEAKER_04:  1.1 million individuals lost their job. \nSPEAKER_00:  their job. \nSPEAKER_04:  865,000 of those individuals were women. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then in the following month, there was a huge job gain. And the net gain was 12,000 jobs. But the net gain, we're still in that loss for women, even though there was a significant gain for men. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think that it's important to know how many \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  women have taken a step back from their workplace or their ability to advance because the challenges related to ensuring their children are educated in the homes and providing appropriate care. \nSPEAKER_04:  for those children and they're not able to leave the house and I know you've got a lot of work related to the the LB \nSPEAKER_04:  uh \nSPEAKER_00:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  work LB portal and some opportunities and potentially we could use funding for in the future. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  with our labor matching, but it hasn't always been enough and I know that \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilwoman. \nSPEAKER_04:  Alan has spoken a lot about her love and desire for childcare and how it's necessary. But I don't know that we can know the proportionality and amount of necessity until we know the numbers related to gender and perhaps gender and um \nSPEAKER_04:  motherhood even would be a potential because women who lose their job that might be in a particular industry might be younger and less likely to be parents versus women that are at different stages or different types of careers. So any information you can provide in that regard would be helpful in the future, but this so far has been amazing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Absolutely, yeah, and I do have Nick Schultz on the on he's he's here today can answer specific questions if you want those answer today otherwise we're both taking notes and we'll be making sure to to to to include that category in in the final report. I will say that right now it what's interesting is the initial report and this is again only for the unemployment claims so so the Long Beach resident would have had to file for unemployment insurance right now women and men are roughly the same which is different than what you're hearing about the national data about the impacts of this recession on women it's been much greater impact on women nationally so right now we can see that that the men and women in Long Beach have filed about an equal number of claims but we want to dig in to find out more about if there are women who have left the workforce and not filed claims or for some reason we're not capturing their experience the right way so these are good questions for us and we want to use that to to to finalize our reports and get the council what they need. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, John, I would just jump in. I'm not one. This is, I mean, this is something we've, we've addressed for a couple years and still probably hasn't elevated to level it. But regionally as a city in terms of head of household, we have more single mother had a household with multiple dependents than many of our neighbors in Los Angeles in Los Angeles County. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think the fact of the matter is, \nSPEAKER_05:  those folks have to support a household and are finding a way to work and continue to work. And \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, they're not in the data because they've transitioned, they've changed jobs and it's what they have to do at this point in time. And I think the demand that we've seen for childcare is also reflective of that. There's not a reasonable alternative for them. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks, Nick. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. That's excellent. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do any members of the committee have any comments on the item? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks, Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_06:  Sure. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  Just a couple things. First, I love the format. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_06:  the way that you're reporting on the economic equity study study. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we initially, you know, initially with the economic equity study. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, we talked about this. \nSPEAKER_06:  I remember when the economic relief motion was. I think it was maybe March or April last year. \nSPEAKER_06:  that lets identify some resources to understand how this... \nSPEAKER_06:  and how this economic crisis is affecting our communities. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so that's when the conversation started about making it conducting an economic activity study. \nSPEAKER_06:  and I want to make sure. \nSPEAKER_06:  that what we find from the economic. \nSPEAKER_06:  Trucks. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know. \nSPEAKER_06:  Why do we put forward a recommendation? \nSPEAKER_06:  to do an inclusive strategy. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's because of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  is \nSPEAKER_06:  as disproportionate impacts, and we want to make sure we read data to inform our strategy. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's Mike, that was just up on Spike's setting. \nSPEAKER_06:  That was a good thing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_06:  What I noticed was that I could bring that spot back up. \nSPEAKER_06:  You're fast. \nSPEAKER_06:  the finalru7. \nSPEAKER_06:  So it's interesting here. \nSPEAKER_06:  is in- \nSPEAKER_06:  And I want to ask, what does this mean and why? \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  You see that. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hispanic. \nSPEAKER_06:  pretty much proportional 36 40 to pretty close. \nSPEAKER_06:  Y-2831 pretty close. \nSPEAKER_06:  When you look at black, it's a two to one ratio between unemployment campaigns and lobby's work. \nSPEAKER_06:  That either tells me that. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's all you could tell me a few things. \nSPEAKER_06:  I could tell me that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't make up a significant portion of a long beach workforce. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  That, you know, that's one thing we can pull from this. \nSPEAKER_06:  or two, we can see that. \nSPEAKER_06:  The impact, the regional impact on this path that we can have in the next few weeks. \nSPEAKER_06:  this proportion of impact on regions economy, tell the disproportionate impact on. \nSPEAKER_06:  Black workers. \nSPEAKER_06:  in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if you could speak to that. \nSPEAKER_06:  John, and just give me a little bit of analysis on what you think that means. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, certainly. So number one, the way that the data reads is that black workers in Long Beach are about 10% of the workforce, but they represent almost 20% of the claims that were filed. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that's, I just want to explain to the group what you mean by two to one. So this is concerning and this is a good example of when we see a certain racial group representing a larger or disproportionate number of claims as compared to their population. So number one, if we start with the issue of where are black workers, which sectors they're working in, were they in those sectors like service sectors, hospitality, food services, healthcare, that ultimately were disproportionately impacted by the recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, the same can be said about all workers who filed their claims that they were all in sectors that were impacted, but was the black community impacted more? Were they more represented in those sectors that got hit even, you know, the hardest? So those are those are some of the questions that we're starting to look at. And it could mean also with pandemic pandemic unemployment assistance, which this is the new sort of curveball in this unemployment insurance data. \nSPEAKER_00:  is that we really didn't have, you know, benefits, unemployment benefits to protect our gig workers and on demand workers in the past. We did it in this one, in this case, and they actually represent a sizeable percentage of us, Nick Schultz, to weigh in on that. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so questions we have is do we have more of our black residents working in gig work and and were they reflected at a higher level in this particular recession. So there's a number of these issues that we're you know just starting to dig into with the economists. The questions you're asking today or tomorrow or the next day thank goodness we have Cal State Long Beach as our economist who not only love the city of Long Beach but love to dig into these kinds of questions and we can we can go at a deeper and deeper level as we unpack this. One last thing I'll say before asking Nick to add to my comments is \nSPEAKER_00:  We have a full study of about 36. \nSPEAKER_00:  individual interviews, conducted with individuals, and in a number of those are with our Black African American community who have had different experiences in this economy and this recession. So I want you to know Vice Chair Richardson that we also have gone through using qualitative methodologies. We've gone to individuals to find out more about their experience to get answers to those questions. And we intend not only to publish that report but also bring that report to the committee and have Tracy Kalunga and some of the the experts that conducted those studies from a sociological perspective to dig a little bit deeper on the intersections between race and the recession. So Nick was there anything that \nSPEAKER_01:  we \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm missing with regard to the question, the answers that we have right now. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, I think what East that is right, I would just give a little more context, right? So that the 250 \nSPEAKER_05:  1000 claims you see, those are not unique numbers. All right, the unique number of claims. \nSPEAKER_05:  is about 155,000. And the reason for that is some of the things you hit on John Vicks. \nSPEAKER_05:  expanded eligibility, the new pandemic unemployment, people got shifted, benefits ran out before stimulus was enacted, people had to file another claim, that's some of the things that we've seen going on, not to get into the fraud issue that EDD is taking head on at this point in time, but our actual number of unique claims is about 155,000. \nSPEAKER_05:  60% of those are payroll employees. The other 40% is pandemic unemployment, which means a 1099 worker or an individual business operator who may have been eligible under the CARES Act program. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the other thing that I would add is the 7822 split that we hate, right? Don't forget, only about 22% of the residents of Long Beach have the opportunity to work in Long Beach. So 78% of our \nSPEAKER_05:  potential labor force goes somewhere else and we haven't. \nSPEAKER_05:  gone deep enough with our racial demographics to determine how much of an impact that has on the percentages. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's helpful. I think that helps. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the explanation. \nSPEAKER_06:  about this. \nSPEAKER_06:  and highly impacted sectors being over. \nSPEAKER_06:  We'll see you in the next one. Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  black workers. \nSPEAKER_06:  helps make sense. But whether I would process this as we \nSPEAKER_06:  Develop strategies. \nSPEAKER_06:  We should call out those sectors. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that is one way to make sure the very racial equity in our furniture will. \nSPEAKER_06:  Another way is we know that these \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  These unemployment claims are clustered in different areas of town. \nSPEAKER_06:  I had a conversation earlier today with the chief about \nSPEAKER_06:  you know, where the shootings were clustered. If you were to overlay shootings. \nSPEAKER_06:  with the unemployment claims to be the same areas of the town. \nSPEAKER_06:  And if you were to look at those down to ask. \nSPEAKER_06:  very basic question. \nSPEAKER_06:  of where is the workforce center in those areas apparently don't exist. \nSPEAKER_06:  Not there. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so a strategy that makes a lot of sense here. \nSPEAKER_06:  the lining of workforce strategies. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the areas, do you ever have to believe that these is access? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  or these workers. \nSPEAKER_06:  install that. That's \nSPEAKER_06:  An example of the type of alignment. \nSPEAKER_06:  between why mission economic study. \nSPEAKER_06:  to inform the economic recovery strategy. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we're going to bring forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  The other thing I'll say is, is, is important to fully contextualize. \nSPEAKER_06:  the data. \nSPEAKER_06:  And yeah, thanks for pulling up the map, these areas. \nSPEAKER_06:  You look at that. \nSPEAKER_06:  9-08 \nSPEAKER_06:  One three and nine away to five and nine away one oh. \nSPEAKER_06:  Those are the same areas. \nSPEAKER_06:  You were a look at shooting. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, there isn't even the 90810, there's even a computer lab. \nSPEAKER_06:  The 9.0.1L. \nSPEAKER_06:  There isn't a computer lab. \nSPEAKER_06:  There is it. \nSPEAKER_06:  a workforce center. \nSPEAKER_06:  There's nothing there. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know? \nSPEAKER_06:  9-0-8-05, right? Working on, we have strategies. \nSPEAKER_06:  to bring a workforce dinner. \nSPEAKER_06:  bringing up to any college center. \nSPEAKER_06:  But we should be looking at opportunities to accelerate those, particularly now. \nSPEAKER_06:  is more important than ever or the recovery. \nSPEAKER_06:  Goddamn! \nSPEAKER_06:  What I will say is important to contextualize the data. \nSPEAKER_06: \u6211\u4e0d\u6703\u932f\u4e86 \nSPEAKER_06:  sort of the history and why equity is so prominent today here. \nSPEAKER_06:  is because the conversation didn't start with these rounds. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, you had long beach, everyone a listening tour. \nSPEAKER_06:  at one American Planning Association Award and Capital Epoch Award. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, you have the Race Black Weir Acconciliation Initiative. \nSPEAKER_06:  Last summer. \nSPEAKER_06:  that. \nSPEAKER_06:  code. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, pulled a lot of the data. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the recommendations and aligned it with that strategy. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then when we made the motion in December, \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, to begin this process, it was hey. \nSPEAKER_06:  It wasn't. \nSPEAKER_06:  It was a line economic equity study with a strategy around policy investment. \nSPEAKER_06:  and state and federal advocacy because it's not just about the federal funds. \nSPEAKER_06:  We need to make sure that the policies \nSPEAKER_06:  moving forward. The policies on those funds are in the role. \nSPEAKER_06:  Align with this strategy. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know? \nSPEAKER_06:  I had a conversation with you know, Alan Lenthal last week and it's \nSPEAKER_06:  This one time, this one time, runs. \nSPEAKER_06:  are not just about. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  you know. \nSPEAKER_06:  feeling the gap. \nSPEAKER_06:  These funds are about making strategic investments. \nSPEAKER_06:  that will help. \nSPEAKER_06:  shape the new economy that's being created. And it's incredibly important to understand the concept. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we're not. \nSPEAKER_06:  moving forward with this, thinking about these relief funds. \nSPEAKER_06:  These are recovery funds, mate. \nSPEAKER_06:  to make a strategic investment into our economy. So. \nSPEAKER_06:  My recommendation is for the next item, but I think. \nSPEAKER_06:  In general, I certainly appreciate the data that's come forward from this economic equity study. We just need to make sure that the feedback from the round tables are not stand alone. \nSPEAKER_06:  Right? The feedback from the round tables are one data. \nSPEAKER_06:  with an broader set of data with the economic equity study and the feedback. \nSPEAKER_06:  sort of around. \nSPEAKER_06:  directly to the big plan and the average one. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that's important just to put all that. \nSPEAKER_04:  excellent input. \nSPEAKER_04:  I might even add to that that the chart should if it's percentage of residents we might want to see what the residential breakdown is associated with it next to it to see that same comparison. Great insights. \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilwoman Allen. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilwoman Mango. \nSPEAKER_02:  So are we at this point, just want to make sure that I'm, this is the right time to do this, for we talking about the. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, our thoughts are we going into some of the priorities? How do you want? Is it the time now for these kind of comments? \nSPEAKER_04:  So we have two agenda items. We have this item, which is the data that drives it. And I know you've seen this data many times because as you rewatch the videos, a lot of the data was there too. But I put it to separate agenda items so that it would be easier on staff. \nSPEAKER_02:  Got it. Okay. All right. That I will I will hold off on my comments. \nSPEAKER_04:  Excellent. \nSPEAKER_04:  Then we have already taken public comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll make a motion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do we have a second? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Roll. \nSPEAKER_01:  call vote please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair Mungo? \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_01:  Councilwoman"

The Economic Development and Finance Committee, of course, recommended to the City Council to conduct the research and then the community outreach and the council on December 15. Approved that recommendation from the committee, including these four objectives of legislative agenda incorporating recommendations from the racial reconciliation report meeting with community groups from across different sectors and then deliver a report back to the council before April 1. I just wanted to remind everybody the context of of this outreach. So so over the past three weeks, it's been a fascinating experience for me. And so I appreciate being able to meet with over 25 different community groups over 350 participants in those meetings. There are about 90 minutes each and conducted via Zoom. We had six standard questions about the challenges and solutions and ultimately the recommendations of the different groups for Marin City Council. And we've actually dictated the verbal comments, tip notes, and we'll have those for you in the final report. We also recorded recorded a bunch of the chat through the e-commerce on Zoom. And then... \nSPEAKER_00:  Some groups actually prepared their own summary reports and submitted those to us. So we'll include those as well for you in the final report. So our intention is to make all of this available to you in writing online for the public to review the community outreach comments. I'm sorry this is so small. I just wanted to get a feel for the different the size and scope of this effort. We do have recordings of every one of these these 90 minute meetings. And we did it all within the three week period in the month of February that we did a fast and furious. So we could get back in time to meet the deadline that the council had set. We met with many different groups from from the trades and labor and construction and services to business associations and community-based organizations and it was really a fascinating perspective of the Long Beach Economy. So the major the major themes and this is not to diminish that the hundreds of comments we got. But we did our best in a short time to try to summarize the comments that were consistent and that were promoted by multiple groups. And ultimately I'll call this our top 10. They really talked a lot about protecting their workers whether they were workers groups or if they were business owners about how we can get you know proactive vaccination outreach and that that was really important for them to be able to reopen and recover. The community groups said that public health and safety addressing the needs of people experiencing homelessness and the public safety issues that have popped up over the course of the pandemic. The city needs to develop a strategy around addressing those issues before customers will come back to their businesses or that nonprofits can resume. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, the in-person gathering piece, that's a major, major piece of this whole thing. Community-based partnerships were highlighted as the single most important strategy that the city needs to engage in to design the right kinds of recovery programs, to contract with, you know, community-based organizations who are trusted and to work with business associations and business districts who know their communities of business owners really well. \nSPEAKER_00:  This issue of trust was major across the board, the community groups. We heard a lot about the uncertainty of the COVID pandemic and the need for trust and for the city and city leadership to engage in communication with businesses and nonprofits about reopening so that they're really clear and have more certainty about taking the financial risk to bring back employees and reopen. It's been a very uncertain time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Another major issue was the eviction cliff, this fear of the eviction moratoriums expiring on June 30th and huge balloon payments for commercial and residential tenants. \nSPEAKER_00:  But also for property owners, they have obligations, you know, to pay for their mortgages and their lenders. And so they're really looking for support from the city and the stimulus on how we can coordinate either resources or even direct relief. \nSPEAKER_00:  for real estate. \nSPEAKER_00:  The last five of our top 10 continued our need-based decision making. So I think the council members mentioned before in the economic research that this is a very unequal recession and impacted different neighborhoods, different sectors differently. So we need to look at this as a targeted data-driven approach and really target resources around those who have the most needs and maybe even be able to leverage the haves, the people who did well during the recession to help in \nSPEAKER_00:  generating consumer spending and engaging with the solution of recovery. \nSPEAKER_00:  revenue generation, customer generation, and activation. That was by far the measure of success that we heard across the board in nearly all of our sessions was that for nonprofits to be able to bring their customers back, their clients, to serve their clients as well as businesses to bring customers back and generate revenue. That was going to be the way that they could reopen, recover, and then sustain their recovery. \nSPEAKER_00:  Another area that came up a lot was actually inclusive procurement. How the city could do a better job of using its own spending and procurement to invest in local small businesses, particularly businesses in the sectors that experience the great impacts. Under represented entrepreneurs, people of color, women, these were, there's an opportunity for the city to simplify, cut the red tape. That's the next recommendation on city procurement for grants and loans and service agreements and provide technical assistance to those most in need because that's one way the city can help. \nSPEAKER_00:  reaching the people who can recover most quickly. And then finally, in top 10, incorporating past plans. So there were a number of groups who had participated in previous discussions about economic equity and economic development, the blueprint for economic development, the framework for racial reconciliation, \nSPEAKER_00:  So there's a lot of opportunity for us as the community sees it to surface those plans as part of our recovery and to use those as a guidepost. So a couple of guiding principles targeting those resources, vaccinating our service sector workforce, relaunching those business sectors hardest hit is the fastest way to recover the most jobs in those sectors. Generating customers is the is the way that they said that we could help them most. \nSPEAKER_00:  and activating consumer spending, leveraging the private sector spending. Our dollars are limited, but if we have a $3 billion economy, our $3 million, our $10 million, is just a drop in the bucket. \nSPEAKER_00:  We need to really be targeted on leveraging private sector business to business spending, business to consumer spending. \nSPEAKER_00:  and avoid leakage to other areas for services and goods. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then finally, activating our community-based partnerships, they, the community groups, this was a real clear guiding principle about how we can get the highest return on investment. \nSPEAKER_00:  and take an efficient approach to the recovery plan. So some sample spending categories, we tried to take the temperature, you know, we tried to, I would ask them, hey, what's the most important? You know, what's the one thing that you think council should do? You know, if they had money to target for the recovery. And really, these were the sample spending categories that came up most often. So direct relief, money in the pockets of nonprofits, business owners, tenants, landlords, economic inclusion, targeting the groups that need it the most, digital inclusion. That was major getting people connected to the internet to find resources to be able to get state and federal grants, get their unemployment benefits. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then worker support like childcare, vaccinations, PPE, and then youth, youth workforce support, re-engaging with these youth that have been out of school, then disconnected from a lot of the institutions that help find the economic opportunity. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then customer generation, the city could engage in a massive customer activation campaign to buy lawn beach, buy local, get out there and spend money if you have it. Technical assistance for our community-based organizations, as well as our businesses to transition business models, get online, those kinds of things, find grants and resources, and then finally, the real estate support. Not necessarily having the money ourselves, but helping people find the money for tenant relief, storefront activation, pop-ups, permitting, special events, things like that. So these categories that I'm sharing with you are just samples. They're in the percentages or examples where we tried to kind of break down where we thought the need and demand was. And this is not reflective of actual recommended amounts. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I'll finish up right here. We have a massive report to produce for you. You know, a memo. Of course, the attachments with all the findings and comments and things like that. That's forthcoming. So I want you to know that that's going to be made available before April 1st. But today, I want to just to give you the initial feedback from the community around table. So with that, \nSPEAKER_00:  Just know today is the second, you know, there's the mayor recovery act kickoff next week, the summary report that will produce for you will be posted on March 8th based on some of the feedback you give me today. And then the Economic Development Commission, we're going to meet with them on the 8th to get some additional feedback. \nSPEAKER_00:  with a final report coming to the council on March 16th. So I'll stop right there and turn it back over to Chair Mungo. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Mr. Chrysler. Excellent. I know Miss Allen was most excited to provide her feedback. So let's start with Cindy, Councilwoman Allen. \nSPEAKER_02:  Well, thank you, Chair Mungo. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so I just want to first say that this has just been \nSPEAKER_02:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_02:  just an amazing thing to be involved in. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want to thank the hundreds of community stakeholders who spent their time. \nSPEAKER_02:  and provided so much great input. \nSPEAKER_02:  And John Keisler and your team. \nSPEAKER_02:  You were an incredible facilitator and I think you did a really good job. \nSPEAKER_02:  at making sure that we weren't talking, but we were listening. And I just commend you. \nSPEAKER_02:  for all your hard work there. \nSPEAKER_02:  And unfortunately due to the Brown Act, you know, I wasn't allowed to join in these meetings live. \nSPEAKER_02:  But no, I did watch. I think it was like 36 hours. \nSPEAKER_02:  of videos. \nSPEAKER_02:  And, and then you know, following up with with our team and stakeholders. \nSPEAKER_02:  and study staff. And so \nSPEAKER_02:  uh, John, I agree with you. This has just been an absolutely fascinating, fascinating process for me too. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I just learned, I learned so much. \nSPEAKER_02:  that what's happening out there and what people's needs are that I wasn't even aware of. And so I just, just one of these things that I am so happy \nSPEAKER_02:  that I got to be involved with. \nSPEAKER_02:  I do look forward to all the good work that we are going to do. \nSPEAKER_02:  what we're doing here is unprecedented and it's so important in people. \nSPEAKER_02:  are really depending on us. \nSPEAKER_02:  to get this right. \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the things that I want to make sure that however this plays itself out that it's not over complicated. \nSPEAKER_02:  We do need to make sure that we need, you know, that we're moving quickly. \nSPEAKER_02:  these businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  and organizations out there really need our help. So we just need to try. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, sometimes in city government, we can get things, a lot of bureaucracy takes place and things, a lot of red tape and things get complicated, but we have to keep \nSPEAKER_02:  this simple. \nSPEAKER_02:  This recovery and this plan is really going to depend on us. \nSPEAKER_02:  getting this right. So one of the things I want to share also, John, I know you did it, but I also want to share some of the things that I, some of the common themes that I heard of too. \nSPEAKER_02:  that are in addition. \nSPEAKER_02:  to what you heard, but you know, it's just going to be very, very important that we help folks that are most impacted. \nSPEAKER_02:  There are some businesses who haven't even been able to open. \nSPEAKER_02:  and there are \nSPEAKER_02:  people talk a lot about restaurants, but there are some restaurants that are doing better than ever. And so we want to make sure that we are working with those that are \nSPEAKER_02:  that are most impacted. \nSPEAKER_02:  We need to expand our child care in every way. It's going to be absolutely instrumental in getting people. \nSPEAKER_02:  back to work. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  uh at the end of the day most people in this city work for a business. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we need to make sure that we have plans and resources. \nSPEAKER_02:  and place. \nSPEAKER_02:  to make it really simple for these businesses to \nSPEAKER_02:  apply for help. \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the things I heard a lot is that, you know, it wasn't before the way grants were divvied out, it wasn't always equitable, it was first come for a serve. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we got to make sure that we do it right this time. \nSPEAKER_02:  because there are just some businesses that don't have the same access that other businesses have. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so let's just make sure that we're paying attention. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, to that. \nSPEAKER_02:  And we also need to work collaboratively with each of the businesses. Because if you think of all these businesses as different verticals and they're going to have different needs and we need to understand. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm that. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I like, John, you talked about trust. We heard that a lot didn't we? We heard that we have a lot of work to do to restore trust. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we have an opportunity to do that and I'm willing to put the work in. I know \nSPEAKER_02:  that you guys are too. \nSPEAKER_02:  We also need to make sure that our nonprofits and our community-based organizations \nSPEAKER_02:  are so important and they were with so many sectors of our community, whether it's daycare, arts, housing, \nSPEAKER_02:  through distribution and that they're all included in this recovery process because their voice and their help as you guys know and I'm sure you agree it's going to be important in our \nSPEAKER_02:  recovery. \nSPEAKER_02:  And there may even be instances where we have to relax rules. I know from being a previous business owner, you know, you're always nervous of health department shows up. They're kind of seen as the enemy or inspectors. And one of the things \nSPEAKER_02:  that. \nSPEAKER_02:  that really. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think some of the bars and barbershop are talking about their signage. \nSPEAKER_02:  A lot of people don't know that these businesses are open. \nSPEAKER_02:  And when we may have to relax some of our signage for this short period of time, whether we put A-Frame down on the sidewalk or to whatever we need to do to help these businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  be able to know that they're opening back up and we can help promote them. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, \nSPEAKER_02:  We also need to... \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, \nSPEAKER_02:  Look at \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, I'm the. \nSPEAKER_02:  Peabits. \nSPEAKER_02:  and are there ways that we could help? \nSPEAKER_02:  that P beds, I think that we did that last time and that's still another way that we can. \nSPEAKER_02:  reach out through the P-Bids that help the businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  and also \nSPEAKER_02:  out. \nSPEAKER_02:  Some of the things that come to mind to me is, you know, like the event spaces haven't been able to be open. The CVB, which is going to be really important with employment and all of that performing arts, the museums. \nSPEAKER_02:  the bars, the full service restaurants, you know, they're going to need more help. And I'm just naming it few. So if I forget any any any businesses, please forgive me, but these are just some of the things that are top of mind that we need. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know. \nSPEAKER_02:  to um \nSPEAKER_02:  Pay attention to. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then, then, mostly, I, you know, I did hear that several of the businesses and restaurants are interested in continuing their, their parklets and sidewalks. And, \nSPEAKER_02:  after the pandemic, you know, and maybe that's something that we have to explore or want to explore. \nSPEAKER_02:  It may be a way to assist these businesses in recouping. \nSPEAKER_02:  some of their losses. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Then as far as priorities, as you mentioned, a Chair Mungo. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, it's the childcare really is going to be important for small businesses, for on-demand workers, for all type of workers. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're going to need direct provisions. We're going to need regulatory relief and centers for providers. \nSPEAKER_02:  and for individual seeking care. \nSPEAKER_02:  And if we do that, they're our health department. If we do it for our parks, I'm not, you know, I'm just throwing it out there, but this is going to be instrumental, especially for our service workers to making sure that we have we have childcare. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's going to be important. And then I just said to you know, we need to work with the existing bids. I know in downtown we have the DLBA, we have four streets. \nSPEAKER_02:  and also work with areas that don't have bits. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right? We don't want those folks locked out either. So maybe they're community leaders that we can help get those resources. \nSPEAKER_02:  distributed, you know, in an equitable manner. And that's going to be important to me. I really want to make sure this time it's, it's, it's equitable. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, the the CVB is is also a bit and drives a lot of, you know, activity throughout our city and is a major employer. So I think it's going to be really important for them to get healthy and. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I'd also like to see a local hire. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, an incentive. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think one of the folks even talked about it, one of these round tables like building an app that's just for local hire. And I thought it was an interesting idea. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then also a just a hyper focused by local campaign. \nSPEAKER_02:  is going to be important to so these are all ideas. And then of course we've heard about our business licensing and and I know that's going to be coming to council next week but you know home based businesses I think we have to look at those fees and \nSPEAKER_02:  and um \nSPEAKER_02:  and the model. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then I'm almost done here, but so that chair Mungo. \nSPEAKER_02:  So sorry, it's been a little long that I'm almost done. Then also, we also need to look at, you know, closing this digital divide. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's going to be important and we all heard that on if not all of the round tables how it's impacted our community so that definitely \nSPEAKER_02:  needs to be. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_02:  focus. \nSPEAKER_02:  And of course, I'll go back to also, I always were like my marketing hat, but marketing and \nSPEAKER_02:  and making sure that we have \nSPEAKER_02:  a good marketing outreach campaign for buying local. And also a tool set. You know, we heard a lot about the struggles of our gig workers. \nSPEAKER_02:  of our on-demand workers. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, and so we really should have a concerted effort where because they can afford \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, a lot of help and we really should have a some type of tool set set up. Another thing is we need to make sure that we're supporting all of our undocumented workers who are eligible for for federal assistance. And so I've heard that a lot and and I think that we need to somehow figure out that. And then we have to get better at our outreach and in Spanish and Kami and \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean, we have to make sure we we heard that on several round tables how this is not happening as a city we have to be committed to making sure that we \nSPEAKER_02:  that we have good outreach and all these different languages and that we're focused on serving and making sure that we're doing outreach to our underserved. \nSPEAKER_02:  communities that have been hit the hardest during. \nSPEAKER_02:  these layoffs. And then we also just got a double downer efforts and accountability on supporting minority and women home businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  John, you did mention this on contracting and what the city can do. And I think there's an opportunity for us to really look at those. \nSPEAKER_02:  how we contract and how do we help? \nSPEAKER_02:  businesses that are out there that we can get them qualified for for for more of these city contracts. \nSPEAKER_02:  So \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  That's what I have right now and I do have some questions but I do want to hand this back over and give my colleague Rick's Richardson a time to speak. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Councilman Allen. Great points. A couple of things that you'd mentioned. \nSPEAKER_03:  that I just wanted to highlight, but I also found particularly \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  focused by the community. You talk about supporting bids and yes that's important and then growing new business development areas. We heard that a lot whether it was through the \nSPEAKER_03:  Can body and community are this vanic community? \nSPEAKER_03:  business development areas throughout the city. And I know that John and I worked together on a idea that came from the community back in 20. \nSPEAKER_03:  15 or 16, probably 16, where we kind of identified three corridors. And at the time they were in different districts and they each got a investment of up to 250,000. I don't remember we paired it with some infrastructure money and hopefully we'll get an infrastructure grant as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  because a lot of those areas and \nSPEAKER_03:  because remember Richardson knows this, they need the infrastructure around them of the things that the city provides. \nSPEAKER_03:  to also make them desirable to rent. So I am 100% supportive of you and that idea. You talk about expanding access. And we talked a lot about how a very small number of businesses got a majority of the funding in the first round of the CARES Act. And a lot of that has to do with just like you said. \nSPEAKER_03:  access and understanding and taking the time. And a lot of those bids really pushed the businesses to get the funding that they needed. And so I'd love to see an adoptive business program where you're incentivized, especially across the \nSPEAKER_03:  the ethnic communities where. \nSPEAKER_03:  I talked to a business owner just last week. She speaks Kami, her husband speaks Mandarin, and they're a minority-owned business, and they didn't apply for any of the grants or any of the funding. And they were in dire need of funding. And we kind of talked with them about some of their needs, and they didn't even know about the round table that were really focused on Kami business owners. And so we needed to do a better job. There was a, \nSPEAKER_03:  communications toolkit created by the communications department. But we don't always use that as effectively as we could. I'm with the adoptive business idea. It could also adopt the next door neighbor business. There was a lot of discussion about being next door to a vacancy and what does that mean. A lot of cleanup needs and instead of hiring outside companies to constantly do that cleanup. If the business next door would be willing to adopt it. Or if we could find a way I know the arts groups were really talking about activating those space with art popups and other things where a grant could potentially provide a small contribution. \nSPEAKER_03:  for \nSPEAKER_03:  The landlord to open up that space to a local nonprofit. I'm in the area that could also be supportive and helpful. \nSPEAKER_03:  Also, you talk about the parklets so important. And I know parklets can't be everywhere. And I think that there was a specific round table. I'm actually the first week where people talked about, I don't have access to a parklet. What about partnerships in the community where we could go into the parks? \nSPEAKER_03:  getting our arts programs back into the parks. Maybe there's some kind of fee where the costs are reduced because they're an arts program. The County of Los Angeles, my staff and I have been watching LA County Parks and what they're doing to provide either businesses and or arts organizations, a special rate for utilization of those resources as long as they're activated in an equitable way across the city. You can't just activate in certain areas that all areas need to be activated and that really will help draw down some of that area, the areas of our city that don't have as much activation and then are often. \nSPEAKER_03:  utilized for \nSPEAKER_03:  miss \nSPEAKER_03:  less favorable activities that often lead to litter and trash and other things that aren't cleaned up after. I love the local hire and sent to great, great, great component that was brought up in many of our local round tables. \nSPEAKER_03:  We all know the critical need in business licensing and home-based businesses. There was an item we did a few years ago where if you had a business license as a hairdresser, you currently had to pay for two if you worked at two different studios. As the economy recovers and these independent business owners and salon owners are going to try to help people build back their client base. \nSPEAKER_03:  A lot of these individuals might need to work at multiple locations and we don't want them to be burdened with extra costs associated with multiple licenses. So we need to look at what we can do in a license. \nSPEAKER_03:  refund program like we did in 2014 or any of those others that might be able to use the grant funds. I don't want to go over every single one that you did because I know that they're going to have a lot of crossover with Council Member Richardson as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I do want to bring up two or three others that came up. \nSPEAKER_03:  that I felt were particularly \nSPEAKER_03:  important that I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have been mentioned yet, but I haven't been mentioned yet. There was a discussion about Get Outside Downtown and I really think that aligns with the idea of like a movement to buy shop. \nSPEAKER_03:  and get your services along Beach. And whether it's a get outside downtown or a get outside on the east side, I'm activating those areas and pushing for the community to be outside again and be healthy as spring hits. I thought that was a great, great \nSPEAKER_03:  opportunity. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then \nSPEAKER_03:  We spent a lot of investment in the communications toolkit, which also created a citywide calendar. \nSPEAKER_03:  And there was always this discussion of how do we transition all these organizations to actually use the citywide calendar when they've gotten so used to using their own. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, here's that time. There's nothing on the calendar, anyone. There's very few virtual events. And as we plan the rest of 2021 and 2022, let's create that portal that allows all of our arts groups, all of our businesses, all of our restaurants to really use the portal effectively for their own internal marketing. As a resident of Long Beach, when I decide I want to go out to eat and I want to know what \nSPEAKER_03:  fun events are going on in the city. I want to go to my citywide calendar. I want to go to my Go Long Beach app and I want to click on the citywide calendar and I want to see that Super Max is having live music tonight or Boston Nora is doing a craft beer thing with their neighboring such and such and a band is going to be whatever. It should all be right there at our fingertips and we shouldn't be going to those portals that charge our local businesses like \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yelp and others where you paid up the phone, you push the number to call and make it to go order and all the sudden the business gets charged 15 bucks or a dollar 50 or a percentage of the order and all those things. Let's let's be able to build out and and figure it out on our own. So I'm a lot of those investments and I know that \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman. \nSPEAKER_03:  Alan and I may have additional comments to come back to, but I don't want to take up all the time as councilwoman Alan said I'm sure councilmember Richardson has a lot of input on this as well councilman \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_01:  So just a matter before jump in, just a matter of the process. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  I see the last one we're receiving files. Is there a motion on this one? \nSPEAKER_01:  Or are you just taking all of this, are you taking all this feedback, John, and gonna compile it all? \nSPEAKER_01:  process. Wish your process. \nSPEAKER_00:  Certainly, yeah, I believe the intention of the item. \nSPEAKER_00:  is that we're going to the committee will refer recommendations to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so I'm going to incorporate not only what I've shared with you today into a written report like a memo to the City Council. But also the comments that I'm hearing today to make sure that they're incorporated in that final report. So, you know, we'll have the attachments to the report that we'll have. \nSPEAKER_00:  all the community, comments and input and the economic research and everything else. \nSPEAKER_00:  But today's meeting is an effort for the committee members of the council. \nSPEAKER_00:  to make additional. \nSPEAKER_00:  Priorities, you know, promote those priorities so that we can put those. \nSPEAKER_00:  make sure that they're included in the report to the City Council and then the City Council will \nSPEAKER_00:  that report will be published on March 8th and Council will consider it on March 16th. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I'll start going through. My feedback here is substantial. I wrote a lot of it down. I'm turning my fee 30. \nSPEAKER_01:  If you don't. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  I can't help, there it is. \nSPEAKER_01:  We got to go on. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what I see in the report, so first of all, I think \nSPEAKER_01:  I think you're right and sort of the categories you've broken out. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think those reflect what you heard. They're also consistent with the themes. \nSPEAKER_01:  again \nSPEAKER_01:  This process started. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm beginning to pandemic. This is really a third phase of a larger. \nSPEAKER_01:  Peace and that's these the elements we've seen come up. \nSPEAKER_01:  consistently. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think when it comes to equity, I think the first point I was saying this. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know what? \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know what John's a member Allen kind of mentioned it. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we've gotten better equities since beginning till now. \nSPEAKER_01:  Initially, when we came up with the $800,000. \nSPEAKER_01:  fun. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the $10,000 loans. \nSPEAKER_01:  You remember we opened it up? \nSPEAKER_01:  And the money was gone in a... \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, in a blink of an eye right at the beginning. \nSPEAKER_01:  None of that made money made it to these businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  Central Long Beach or North Long Beach or very very \nSPEAKER_01:  Small amounts. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we began, we made a motion at council to put an equity lens on everything we do this COVID related. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so the very first point I'm going to start with is \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not interested in, you know, if I was a mistake during \nSPEAKER_01:  CARES Act calling out, hey, we're gonna put a million dollars to this group or a million dollars to that group. \nSPEAKER_01:  Nope, black fun, Latino fun. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's important that we as leaders. \nSPEAKER_01:  Don't. \nSPEAKER_01:  go for that and we say. \nSPEAKER_01:  All of the funds, all of the strategies are to advance. \nSPEAKER_01:  Equities a part of every dollar. That's out there. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we need to make sure that an equity lens is consistent. \nSPEAKER_01:  throughout the program. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that's incredibly important. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  The next thing I would say is \nSPEAKER_01:  And we've gotten better at it. Let's continue to refine it and get it right. \nSPEAKER_01:  Just like the data you just showed around industries, that's something we can factor into there. \nSPEAKER_01:  equity link. So as you put out restaurant, I'm not restaurant. \nSPEAKER_01:  Business support dollars. \nSPEAKER_01:  Think about those. \nSPEAKER_01:  hard hit sectors and make sure you add additional preferences to whatever your sectors. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll get to the right place. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  I think some of the categories in terms of terminology that you talked about workforce, and visual inclusion, talked about. \nSPEAKER_01:  customer generation. \nSPEAKER_01:  technical assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  To me, all of that is economic. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't think economic inclusion is a category, something you just add on. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's how we administer every \nSPEAKER_01:  So we're doing technical assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  economic inclusion to me is. \nSPEAKER_01:  We know technical assistance will look very differently for Cambodian business. \nSPEAKER_01:  outside of a business district, then it would look. \nSPEAKER_01:  and stay downtown on a roll of all businesses to have. \nSPEAKER_01:  a DLBA or something like that. That's going to look different. So when we think about \nSPEAKER_01:  technical assistance, let's put the cultural context on it, let's think about it. \nSPEAKER_01:  how we get to these businesses are hard to reach. \nSPEAKER_01:  to make sure that they can fully participate in all of the program. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's just a matter of thinking about how we do it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now there are some categories on the lift up. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now these come directly. \nSPEAKER_01:  These were themes that \nSPEAKER_01:  Right. \nSPEAKER_01:  that came up in the round tables, but have been consistent throughout reconciliation and all of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  and everyone in plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now, thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  to make the point here that \nSPEAKER_01:  We don't. \nSPEAKER_01:  have to. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, every time we do this, Gargan Pony show every six months, we do round tables. \nSPEAKER_01:  come up with new solutions. \nSPEAKER_01:  Council is voting on solutions, we have had resources on, we've evaluated these things. \nSPEAKER_01:  Got an awards for the plan. We're great at planning. \nSPEAKER_01:  but implementation, that's what this is about. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's an opportunity to place some down payment. \nSPEAKER_01:  on some things from strategies that can really help close the gaps in our city. \nSPEAKER_01:  and also make some movement on things that maybe big ideas, but we can start making an advancement on it there. So as it relates to housing and home ownership, here's some things I want to list up. \nSPEAKER_01:  So one. \nSPEAKER_01:  We talked about housing counseling. \nSPEAKER_01:  HUD certified housing council. We identified that it was a gap. There was no HUD certified housing council in the entire city of Long Beach. Oasis 1. \nSPEAKER_01:  was in Compton and neighborhood housing services. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now, um, \nSPEAKER_01:  UCC, United Camp Boding Community took steps to begin the process of becoming a HUD certified housing counselor, but what these certified counselors do is help key people in their home. \nSPEAKER_01:  and they're certified by HUD to do so. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now, we don't have an institution in our city who is certified. I think we need to make an investment into some anchor institution. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, we just created two CDCs in our city, LBCI and LBEP. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? You have one organization, you see this already started the process. \nSPEAKER_01:  How can we celebrate that to make sure that's available? \nSPEAKER_01:  or this recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  Secondly. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  There's been an ongoing conversation about support for renter that we've created. \nSPEAKER_01:  Renter assistance funds and all these things, but changing. \nSPEAKER_01:  sort of dynamics and landscape around the Rinsland landlord. \nSPEAKER_01:  market. The rules are changing. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm a landlord, space is a landlord. \nSPEAKER_01:  The rules are changing and there's very few places for small property owners to figure out. \nSPEAKER_01:  Where do you get your \nSPEAKER_01:  the appropriate notice to make sure you're not. \nSPEAKER_01:  You don't. \nSPEAKER_01:  accidentally infringing on someone's rights, the appropriate notice here or there. \nSPEAKER_01:  above. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know \nSPEAKER_01:  The easiest place to get is go to the Department of Association, pay 250 bucks a member, 300 bucks a member. Those things should be... \nSPEAKER_01:  free and available. \nSPEAKER_01:  particularly now as the rules are changed. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  On the other hand, \nSPEAKER_01:  It's difficult for renters. \nSPEAKER_01:  to navigate all of the rules. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  The community is asked for a rent tool. \nSPEAKER_01:  Deveja. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  a rental housing division. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's a big... \nSPEAKER_01:  us. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now. \nSPEAKER_01:  These are one-time monies. We know you can't build a whole division one time. \nSPEAKER_01:  fun, but we can do is put a down payment to those things. We should be thinking about \nSPEAKER_01:  using funds strategically to, you know, grab a portion of a city attorney and a coordinator to make sure that you can answer questions for renters and small property owners to help navigate recovery. That's something we can do with a very small amount of one-time money. \nSPEAKER_01:  to make a big difference in terms of navigating thanks for reaching. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other thing around the housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, is the access to home ownership. So we did a study, we did a study in 2018 with green lighting institute to show that, you know, the housing market in terms of buying homes pretty, pretty healthy. A lot of turnover happening on an all parts of Tampa, but it shows is in north and in central Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  people who live in that community. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, having or having a difficult time. \nSPEAKER_01:  They're not the ones buying the homes and their, so renters are not matriculating the homeowners. \nSPEAKER_01:  in our city. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's a major issue that has to be, can't be silent on that in the recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we went through, we evaluated John U and Patrick Erie, we evaluated strategies two from four came back and said, if we had money, we would do a soft second mortgage program. \nSPEAKER_01:  for down payment assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're not talking about $200,000 down. We're talking about the most significant issue that came up was people's ability to meet the down payment even if it's on FHA. \nSPEAKER_01:  So $25,000 small. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, micro a soft second loan program, putting up that fund. \nSPEAKER_01:  allows you to do a couple things. It allows you to... \nSPEAKER_01:  leverage out of funds to put in. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then you only see it once because as people re-fi or as things happen, \nSPEAKER_01:  they paid out for on the back. \nSPEAKER_01:  small interest, but it grows and you continue to target it in the areas where you see that you have that. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, it's not every neighborhood that has this problem. It's very unique. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  factors there. So that's something I think needs to be representing. \nSPEAKER_01:  Another idea that came up through everyone in is reflected. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the reconciliation plan is actually \nSPEAKER_01:  Go for Strategy 3-H in the Reconciliation Plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  is public land trust. \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's not something that you see the benefits on today. \nSPEAKER_01:  But if we work with our CDC's or WebRidance at the Senate of the Land Trust, \nSPEAKER_01:  that opens up your playbook for \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  Co-ops. \nSPEAKER_01:  for homeownership, maybe you can't afford a whole house, but maybe you can go in as a co-op as a bridge to get into homeownership. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's something that \nSPEAKER_01:  requires a little bit of planning dollars. The planning dollars in a partnership with \nSPEAKER_01:  someone to create that. \nSPEAKER_01:  agents, you know, create that land trust. \nSPEAKER_01:  to make it available. So those are some suggestions. \nSPEAKER_01:  on. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I should be spoken to in this. \nSPEAKER_01:  player. \nSPEAKER_01:  The next. \nSPEAKER_01:  We talk about small business diverse entrepreneurship. \nSPEAKER_01:  Under that category. \nSPEAKER_01:  We made a recommendation to create a small, municipal, small business council. You were excited about this idea, John. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the idea here was \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, if you pay a business license to the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  You pay a business license, you don't get as much as a welcome letter. \nSPEAKER_01:  and I'll open six restaurants during the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  of those six restaurants. \nSPEAKER_01:  No one from the city showed up to them to say. \nSPEAKER_01:  Welcome to the neighborhood. I mean, the council office showed, but... \nSPEAKER_01:  Your staff is spread in. We used to have these redevelopment navigators. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, and they would play that role, but no one showed up. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  How are they going to know about the assistance they have? It took a risk on opening up in our city at a very difficult time. \nSPEAKER_01:  And no one even showed up to say, here's our grant. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here's what we can do on your business license. \nSPEAKER_01:  at all. No one's done that. \nSPEAKER_01:  And you don't end and and the membership agency that exists. You have a chamber of commerce. It does cost. I think by simple virtue of paying a business license fee, you should get access membership in some business support network period. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we need to, the plan is there. It's already been voted on by council. \nSPEAKER_01:  From four came back, we just need a little bit of money to hire a coordinator. \nSPEAKER_01:  Well. \nSPEAKER_01:  Great old business recovery coordinator. \nSPEAKER_01:  for this small business. \nSPEAKER_01:  effort. \nSPEAKER_01:  and allow and you know maybe create a partnership and allow \nSPEAKER_01:  There's no black business, no casino business associate, any of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a way to do that now. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's more important than ever. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next, business navigators in general. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  The areas of town that we highlighted are impacted. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those businesses need an alligator. \nSPEAKER_01:  We don't have a navigator. Like I said, someone who can say welcome, let me help you navigate. Now some of the business improvement districts have to them, not all of them. \nSPEAKER_01:  Most of the bids are small. They don't have the budget for theft. \nSPEAKER_01:  They do their clean team, their safety, and their done. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? We need an advocate in North, West Long Beach, South Fadon, East Navigator. \nSPEAKER_01:  Met Soundies and Navigator, we need to... \nSPEAKER_01:  help businesses navigate the recovery. So we need to invest in a minimum of four navigators in our city. \nSPEAKER_01:  That needs to happen. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  The next category is procurement and contract. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we as a city. \nSPEAKER_01:  Have massive. \nSPEAKER_01:  ability to support small businesses within our community. \nSPEAKER_01:  minority on businesses, women on businesses, if we do a better job at contract. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now we've done this comes to council every year. Someone's got a new idea. \nSPEAKER_01:  Rieglop preference on this, Rieglop press on this on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  We made a motion at council. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it made it into everyone in plan and the reconciliation plan is goal one strategy seven eight. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_01:  Dedicated percentage of long-beet spending on local diverse businesses by establishing and streamlining our procurement process. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now this is not a short term. This is one of those put a down payment. \nSPEAKER_01:  on our bigger. \nSPEAKER_01:  thing that has a greater impact. \nSPEAKER_01:  LA County set a goal at 10%. \nSPEAKER_01:  We need to be setting a goal that's 10%. \nSPEAKER_01:  We need to invest in \nSPEAKER_01:  providing the resources, financial management. \nSPEAKER_01:  to begin that study immediately. \nSPEAKER_01:  to begin that study. It may take a year, but at the end of the year, put the council in a position. \nSPEAKER_01:  to implement that 10% or whatever it is, go of targeting local and \nSPEAKER_01:  That in and of itself will create a tire economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we can sit and center by. \nSPEAKER_01:  locating in distressed areas of town and other things that creates a lot \nSPEAKER_01:  of opportunities for our recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next, oh, next category is workforce development. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now under the workforce development category. \nSPEAKER_01:  We talked about this a little bit earlier. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the areas of town. \nSPEAKER_01:  hard to sit by crime. \nSPEAKER_01:  The area's a town hardest hit by COVID. \nSPEAKER_01:  There are no presence of workforce in those areas. They're not open. \nSPEAKER_01:  There are some strategies. \nSPEAKER_01:  but they've taken a long time. They don't exist in these communities. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a commitment to go into the place on the with low. \nSPEAKER_01:  Willow \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not over. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a commitment to go into the health act with the office or how to park. \nSPEAKER_01:  under construction. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a commitment to North Palm Beach High Red Center. \nSPEAKER_01:  not open. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is an opportunity to invest in accelerating those strategies. \nSPEAKER_01:  and closing what gaps are left. I think really there's \nSPEAKER_01:  two gaps. There's the West side. They don't even have a computer level in the West. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then there's down and central. \nSPEAKER_01:  and in central, there's some opportunities there. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  We need to invest. \nSPEAKER_01:  and accelerating those and closing the caps. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a, there's an item on the agenda tonight around libraries. \nSPEAKER_01:  Libraries are a great place to put a social work and a workforce center in because you already have four walls. \nSPEAKER_01:  and second access technology. So \nSPEAKER_01:  That's something we need to think about. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next category is on. \nSPEAKER_01:  Development. \nSPEAKER_01:  Development. \nSPEAKER_01:  has continued in some places and some projects have stalled. If we got those projects unstuck, that's immediate economic relief. \nSPEAKER_01:  immediate boom to our economic recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  During the pandemic, we opened up sound comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  They got it open. They got the restaurants open. \nSPEAKER_01:  bigger out a few more things, but they're pretty much done. \nSPEAKER_01:  But the lab is stuck. \nSPEAKER_01:  and Wesleyan is stuck. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, there's commitments to do stuff, but we need to merge and see here. \nSPEAKER_01:  We need to be, we need to identify where the, let's say there's 10 projects across the city. We need one on, but \nSPEAKER_01:  to go and work them through the entire permitting process. \nSPEAKER_01:  from fire to planning to public works. Get it all done and accelerate those projects. And it shouldn't be at any additional cost to them. So we should make an investment into accelerating development that has an immediate impact here. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's on development. \nSPEAKER_01:  The last big. \nSPEAKER_01:  kind of big. \nSPEAKER_01:  big, big piece here that I think needs to be. \nSPEAKER_01:  Lift it up. It starts with a question. John. \nSPEAKER_01:  We made a motion for economic empowerment as well as a council. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  And we got two from Fort Mimalt, most things. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  And what it is in general is we know that the economic circumstances in key areas of town have been the same for generation. Need to change the factors in those areas so businesses and \nSPEAKER_01:  people have a \nSPEAKER_01:  More EV, opportunity to thrive. \nSPEAKER_01:  It could be. \nSPEAKER_01:  playing to existing strengths if you have a bid that needs to improve it. \nSPEAKER_01:  It may play into cultural strengths, establishing cultural districts. \nSPEAKER_01:  um north central west do you print your print thing? \nSPEAKER_01:  That was voted on at Council Humanities. \nSPEAKER_01:  Where are we with this program and are you planning on factoring that into your plan that goes forward? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, Council, Vice Chair Richardson, absolutely. And. Congratulations. \nSPEAKER_01:  Daily air advice here. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm gonna say both. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice mayor and vice chair, unequivocally, yes. I think that we have been working on, we've even been working with community groups on some of the components, but we would love to start in earnest to bundle a number of the different priorities that not only the council members of High Life is today. \nSPEAKER_00:  but also through the community and the economic research recommends to focus. \nSPEAKER_00:  multiple \nSPEAKER_00:  resources and investments on the hardest hit areas of the community. So the answer is absolutely yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so just some parts on how you design that. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think you have the general idea, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  the areas that are hardest hit. \nSPEAKER_01:  are always the areas. \nSPEAKER_01:  that have been lagging. It's that old teller to city. So how can we accelerate things in the territory? \nSPEAKER_01:  Some are further along the other, so it really needs to be custom. \nSPEAKER_01:  It really is because of them. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, how you design them and ease the minimum of three zones. It could be up to five, it could be up to six, but a minimum of three. \nSPEAKER_01:  Anchored in. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know those areas and use data but those areas of north central west nomads we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think the areas we can focus on, I mean the things we can focus on are strategies. I'll just highlight a few of them. \nSPEAKER_01:  enhance infrastructure finance districts. We just applied for grant from SCAG to try to do one. \nSPEAKER_01:  And North, we apply for one on Long Beach Boulevard in Midtown. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can think about free as EIFDs. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those things. \nSPEAKER_01:  Business navigation, we talked about that earlier. These areas need an navigate. \nSPEAKER_01:  funding for development of cultural districts. We have a cultural arts district and discussion in North. You have the Latino cultural district on the agenda tonight. These are not unique ideas. There's a conversation around African American cultural center and a cultural district. So all these ideas are not unique, but we need to begin to anchor them to a geographic area. So we can all support it and understand the vision. So funding to help establish these cultural districts \nSPEAKER_01:  I think. \nSPEAKER_01:  cultural art and murals. Our murals got tagged citywide. There have been targeted in these geographic areas. We have the higher youth and higher young artists in your funding, you set aside for artists. Make sure that there is a program to hire local muralists to update the tag murals that exist in the city. And then use data to identify the walls that are most tagged that don't have murals and go mural them. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's a quick economic development strategy that improves utilization of quarter makes everyone safer. \nSPEAKER_01:  feel safer. \nSPEAKER_01:  We need to, we talked about expansion workforce development. We need to be able to speak to what the strategy is in each of those areas. \nSPEAKER_01:  We talk about higher education investment. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, we're putting LBC and CNN North, but we can strengthen our partnerships with the other two campuses. We certainly can maximize the impact. We should think about what partnerships can look like. \nSPEAKER_01:  food security. So food security, I'm sure there'll be separate funding to speak to that, but how do you tie that to the economic? \nSPEAKER_01:  Empowered in Zone, could you say? \nSPEAKER_01:  Hey, as you apply for food grants. \nSPEAKER_01:  You get a preference if you target it in these food, you know, food insecure areas that are tied with easy doesn't cost you any other money. That's just policy. \nSPEAKER_01:  to make sure it's targeted in the right way. \nSPEAKER_01:  on violence prevention. \nSPEAKER_01:  We know there's going to be focus on violence prevention. Tie them to. \nSPEAKER_01:  Survivor economic here is an example. \nSPEAKER_01:  The uptown business district, you know, other business district have a security team already. \nSPEAKER_01:  a little bit of funding, investing and expanding their security service to those business corridors, or maybe even separate funding to expand the service outside, just outside the business corridor. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's funding we can do to make a difference that at least make the commerce environment feel safer through this transition we're going. \nSPEAKER_01:  Is there an inclusion? \nSPEAKER_01:  Lot to be said about that, language access, lot to be said about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then again, the final thing is we need to make sure again that we have an ombudsman to get these stuff developments. \nSPEAKER_01:  moving. So those are just the things that I think are needed for this zone program, the types of pieces. Again, it may not work for everyone. Every area is a different place than others, but these are strategies that we know that works and make it impact today. They'll turn around the community. The last thing I'll say is, and it's not a really economic thing, but \nSPEAKER_01:  It will be hard to move forward with economic recovery if our response times are slipping. So we have to be thinking about. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  you know how we make sure that we're not, you know, response times you're not slipping. \nSPEAKER_01:  through this. \nSPEAKER_01:  So safety has a direct and all correlation to air gun. \nSPEAKER_01:  for us. \nSPEAKER_01:  But thanks a lot. That's my feedback. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I do want to lift up some of the things and actually ask a couple questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know that I've always been supportive of housing and home ownership and that's been a big, big push since I started. I guess from a \nSPEAKER_03:  set of process though when this was brought forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  John, how do you see those folding in since the original item had so much focus on you bringing forward items from the round tables? Do we need to make a recommendation to the and I think \nSPEAKER_03:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_03:  Vice Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_03:  I keep calling you guys my first name and I apologize. You should have heard me in the Infrastructure Committee today. \nSPEAKER_03:  We've been working on this. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've been working on these committees for almost seven years, Stacy. It's okay to say Rex. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so we were talking about \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  pulling all of this together differently. And I know that. \nSPEAKER_03:  A lot of these things have been really strong. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I know that. \nSPEAKER_03:  John and some of your talks, the city management, you kind of feel as though the money's going to be divided up to different department heads to kind of work with and that you're only really focusing on \nSPEAKER_03:  recovery, but as I voiced to you many times, I'm sure my \nSPEAKER_03:  Committee members have voiced to you. I mean it all has to be connected. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I don't know that this committee can at this time refer to the full council. \nSPEAKER_03:  because we don't know what you're planning. I don't see a \nSPEAKER_03:  a flushed out plan. I know you needed input from us and there's a \nSPEAKER_03:  a seated timeline. So I guess two questions. One. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do we need to have another committee meeting Friday when you have a more fleshed out idea where we can give you input on whether or not we want to support it the way it is or what it that looks like. To do you need additional advocacy from this committee to the full council because it seems like you feel like you might be getting. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know. We don't have a number. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're kind of working ambiguously. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Is it premature to bring back a plan without a number? What are your thoughts? \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  And then we talk about these housing and homeownership things. These are things that I'm super passionate about and very supportive of. \nSPEAKER_03:  And they were in many of the other plans throughout the city, but they didn't come up at the round tables. How are you going to broach that from a process standpoint to Mr. Modica to make sure that ideas that are in other plans, but may have not have come up at the round tables are included. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, that's a great question. So. \nSPEAKER_00:  The way that I understand it from the city manager is that \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  When the council takes the action to direct the city manager to bring back a set of recommendations. \nSPEAKER_00:  that he has to bring it back and it has to be his recommendations and the council can change it on the floor. So the way what I understand from Tom is that \nSPEAKER_00:  I did the community outreach, I bring it to you, I get your feedback, and then I take everything that we just did today. \nSPEAKER_00:  including the economic and community outreach stuff and including issues like housing and others that may have not come up with the round tables. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I'm going to bring these to the city manager. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then \nSPEAKER_00:  I guess this is the \nSPEAKER_00:  the beauty of being the big boss, he has to decide which buckets they go into, what his recommendations ultimately will be, who's going to be responsible for it. So even if housing is under development services and \nSPEAKER_00:  and some of our Oscar orcs's team. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, \nSPEAKER_00:  Tom will probably sort it out and let us know as his staff members who's who's unfurst and who's responsible for it. So number one is any issue that you want to raise here is fine. I'll take that to the city manager and then he'll have to sort out who's responsible or what bucket it goes in. \nSPEAKER_00:  and then number two, ultimately Tom's recommendation is his recommendation back to the council. So he's going to take all the feedback today and everything else that we've put together. I'm going to be typing it up. So \nSPEAKER_00:  He's going to get my report on that. And then he's combining this report as well as the recommendations on the other areas that you described whether they're the city's finances or clean and say for homeless services for COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_00:  He's going to compile those under his office. \nSPEAKER_00:  key will take this as one component of his overall set of recommendations. So I don't think that there's a need to meet again. However, you should see coming forward from the city manager on March 8th, he's got to publish that so that it has eight days for the regular agenda. You should see your priorities reflected somewhere in his report. \nSPEAKER_00:  And he's aware of that. \nSPEAKER_00:  If you don't, if I've missed something or he's missed something. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, absolutely the process is that the council will change it on the floor. You'll have a days to review it and make sure that it isn't missing those priorities. And if it is, you know, I think he expects that you'll raise them on at that public meeting. And, um, or in your briefings prior to just to figure out the process for getting those included. So I just wanted to let you know where I sit in the process and that ultimately the actual, um, \nSPEAKER_00:  Council, letter or staff report will actually come from the city manager. \nSPEAKER_02:  be in John and one thing I want to know. \nSPEAKER_02:  I want to throw in there really quickly. One of the things that I noticed that you ask that all of these round tables is \nSPEAKER_02:  you know what the success look like and I would definitely leave you with that. What does it look like? And I sure hope that as this plan is coming together that we have pre-imposed analytics, what does the success look like and how are we measuring that? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks for it. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I think that's going to be important. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, one one of the things I'll add, um, add to the conversation. So in the original. \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendation in December to start this process. \nSPEAKER_01:  It was five point. \nSPEAKER_01:  of what we need to accomplish. \nSPEAKER_01:  So one is \nSPEAKER_01:  Develop a comprehensive economic recovery strategy based on research from the economic equity stuff. That's the first. \nSPEAKER_01:  Follow the one we're going. \nSPEAKER_01:  The second one is engaged with economic development department, civic engagement, civic innovation. \nSPEAKER_01:  Economic Development Commission, Economic Partnership and LBCI, as well as other partners to conduct a community outreach program. That's your 29-metre. \nSPEAKER_01:  third piece, incorporating goals and objectives from a framework for reconciliation report. \nSPEAKER_01:  two, five. \nSPEAKER_01:  Stepically. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  to promote a racially inclusive and equitable economic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now the piece on or is the piece on a ownership. \nSPEAKER_01:  came from there. The homeownership. \nSPEAKER_01:  His name from Reganestiliarstrevford' \nSPEAKER_01:  Go Go One Strategy A. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's where the reference here. So it's specifically called out on the council. \nSPEAKER_01:  So whether this is touched on the round table, it's in the direction from council. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then it's, you know, aligned with. \nSPEAKER_01:  and state legislative efforts. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's why the federal dollars that are going to drive a portion of this are going to go to the Fed Let's Committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  on the 11. \nSPEAKER_01:  to talk about it overall. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then prepared a council report for approval no later than April 1st. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's what's going back on the 16th. So everything's consistent with what we're trying to do here. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then. \nSPEAKER_01:  What John's part of it is, John's part is just one part of the PopMaker pie. \nSPEAKER_01:  because Tom's gonna has two more people to talk. If we brought up something and made it outside of John's pie slice, I get it. \nSPEAKER_01:  His job is just reported back and his Tom's problem to figure out what pie slice if it's any may not be in this life \nSPEAKER_03:  No, I get that. And I just wanted John to say how he was going, yeah. And I just want John to say how he's going to advocate for \nSPEAKER_01:  And I just wanted John. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  more money for these priorities because \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm with you. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's just not enough. I mean, the priorities listed. I mean, this is a $250 million project for us to get what we need done. And we're going to have to do it on a shoestring budget. And we're going to have to leverage those funds. And I totally appreciate. \nSPEAKER_03:  the comments about leveraging consumer spending and all of that and I wanted to raise up some more of council Vice chairs Points related to some of the things that we've brought up in the past that just haven't gotten Over the goal post that really could be unstuck through this opportunity \nSPEAKER_03:  And I also recognize that. \nSPEAKER_03:  the mayor wants to start the council meeting and he's very energetic about that. So \nSPEAKER_03:  In balancing. \nSPEAKER_01:  We will have a double comment on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  We haven't done public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know, that was my next thought. So with that, \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's hand it over to the City Clerk for public comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, we have three members of the public, queued up ready to speak. \nSPEAKER_04:  chin, \nSPEAKER_04:  You have three minutes to speak. Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Good afternoon, City Council, and Vice Mayor Rex Richardson. \nSPEAKER_06:  Councilwoman Stacy Mungo, I appreciate your engagement. \nSPEAKER_06:  with us on the round tables that we hosted. \nSPEAKER_06:  as well as your teams. \nSPEAKER_06:  I am very concerned that when we talk about equity, \nSPEAKER_06:  we seem to forget about the importance of nonprofit organizations. \nSPEAKER_06:  that are doing the work on the ground. \nSPEAKER_06:  such as Ronnie's house. \nSPEAKER_06:  Central Cha UCC. \nSPEAKER_06:  Councilman Richardson, you spoke about. \nSPEAKER_06:  the importance of arming and investing in navigators. \nSPEAKER_06:  We opened up the first business accelerator in North Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  in 2019. \nSPEAKER_06:  We've supported over 300 businesses. \nSPEAKER_06:  70% African Americans. \nSPEAKER_06:  80% women owned businesses. \nSPEAKER_06:  We've been thought partners. \nSPEAKER_06:  We've created spaces for the barber industry. \nSPEAKER_06:  a black-owned businesses, the reentry community, and black nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_06:  in order to achieve equity. \nSPEAKER_06:  but we were completely left out of the CARES Act funding. \nSPEAKER_06:  to support our small businesses. \nSPEAKER_06:  The money went to the bed. \nSPEAKER_06:  as well as association. \nSPEAKER_06:  while nonprofits like ours. \nSPEAKER_06:  and our numbers don't lie. \nSPEAKER_06:  the beauty industry with the number one. \nSPEAKER_06:  grand tease in the last small business. \nSPEAKER_06:  grants because of the amount of outreach that we did. \nSPEAKER_06:  with absolutely no funding from the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  We've got to invest in small organizations. \nSPEAKER_06:  Black and brown organizations. \nSPEAKER_06:  because we're not their day to day to lobby you. \nSPEAKER_06:  and ensure that when the CARES Act funds come in, they cover us. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I want to urge City Council. \nSPEAKER_06:  to ensure that when you talk about a lens of equity, it is thought all the way through the process and that we are investing and utilizing our tools that exist. \nSPEAKER_06:  such as our procurement. \nSPEAKER_06:  and our local nonprofits in order to \nSPEAKER_06:  achieve this economic equity. \nSPEAKER_06:  I really appreciate your time and I hope that \nSPEAKER_06:  We're not just speaking equity, but actually delivering inequity. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next speaker please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Karen, Sarvantes, you have three minutes to speak. Please unmute your phone. Your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, Chair, Mongo, and Council members. My name is Karen. \nSPEAKER_07:  that are on this and I work for Ronnie's house on the director. \nSPEAKER_07:  of outreach and a business coach for the beauty industry. \nSPEAKER_07:  First, thank you for allowing me the opportunity. \nSPEAKER_07:  to address some importance in creating a solid recovery plan. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  The beauty industry has grants a big hit. You are all aware and I'm here today to ask you. \nSPEAKER_07:  to consider a package that includes BGRAD. \nSPEAKER_07:  technical support and waiver, waivers, or renewals of business license. \nSPEAKER_00:  Weaver. \nSPEAKER_07:  In addition, I want to bring attention to the fact that many of our small businesses here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_07:  are owned by undocumented \nSPEAKER_07:  individuals. \nSPEAKER_07:  who have not been able to receive any financial support. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  and have been locked out of federal grant. \nSPEAKER_07:  Today I urge you, I urge the City Council not forget these business owners and to follow city staff recommendations. \nSPEAKER_07:  because they're invested in our businesses. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for your support. \nSPEAKER_04:  Alison Crip. \nSPEAKER_04:  that you have three minutes to speak. Your time starts now. Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. Good afternoon, honorable members of the City Council, Economic Development and Finance Committee and a huge big shout out to John Keisler and his team for all this amazing work. \nSPEAKER_05:  Really thank you for the voice and we really do need more and more voices at this table. On November 17, 2020 at the Long Beach City Council meeting, the Department of \nSPEAKER_05:  Financial Services presented their business and licensee waiver proposal. \nSPEAKER_05:  This proposal was in support of retail and service sectors. The proposal was amended on the floor of a council person's Richardson and to only include restaurants. \nSPEAKER_05:  It was seconded by Council persons and they asked. \nSPEAKER_05:  No discussion and then voted on the floor and voted unanimously in favor as members of the long beach city beauty barber and barber association and business owners. We are writing today and supported their original \nSPEAKER_05:  Proposed will presented by the Department of Financial Management. \nSPEAKER_05:  as the proposal states. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's a gift. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's like, it is. \nSPEAKER_05:  is to provide grants or businesses to offset business license taxes and fees for those businesses closed. \nSPEAKER_05:  or materially restricted and impacted for an extended period of time due to the city health orders. \nSPEAKER_05:  the business sectors that were deferred the most for the retail and service sectors. \nSPEAKER_05:  These sectors include restaurants, food and beauty salons, et cetera. \nSPEAKER_05:  and are all the and the same business actors experience the greatest impact of the health order restriction through mandate closures. \nSPEAKER_05:  The barbering and salunded industry, excuse me, has been forced to open in close three times since March 13th. \nSPEAKER_05:  Through that time industry has not only lost revenue, but has now required to operate at 25% occupancy. \nSPEAKER_05:  and for many they have lost science and stylus due to surrounding cities. \nSPEAKER_05:  as the proposal also states it appears. \nSPEAKER_05:  that many businesses are surviving the pandemic, but others that have having great difficulty, especially if they've been partially or completely closed by the health orders. \nSPEAKER_05:  restaurants have been able to stay open. \nSPEAKER_05:  For take-outs service during the whole health order, while the barring in salon industry has been allowed to be partially open or closed completely. \nSPEAKER_05:  As the pandemic started, there was also implementation of the new AB 5 legislation. This pandemic has forced many to either leave the industry they love or to become an independent contractor for the first time. \nSPEAKER_05:  With the license fees and taxes that it takes to open a small business with little or no income or revenue, it has become even more important to access this grant and it proposal as originally written. \nSPEAKER_05:  to as an opportunity. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's been more important to access this grant and proposal. \nSPEAKER_05:  originally written as an opportunity for the barbrain of cosmology industry. We appreciate your time and considerate your support in the original proposal. \nSPEAKER_05:  presented by the Department of Financial Management Item 70. \nSPEAKER_05:  on November 17, 2020 at City Council. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for your comments. I appreciate everyone who made a comment today, and I just wanted to... \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of just close with a couple of quick things. Thank you to everyone who participated in the roundtables. Thank you to our staff with Economic Development and Finance. Thanks to my committee members for watching the videos. And also, since we all worked hard to kind of get our comments as short as possible, I do want to additionally mention non-profits while they were a component of other things mentioned. They really are a driver of our city. Multiple non-profits are listed on our city's largest job providers. And it's critical that they have the support they need to stay open. I know that one of my previous comments mentioned a little bit about \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  personal services and grooming industry, but also we received a lot of great ideas related to how they could get better support for marketing their own businesses and for that. Let's ensure that we. \nSPEAKER_03:  find a way to help them create jobs to market and support themselves as they reopen to full capacity over the next several months and to get those customers back. So thank you for everyone who made this. \nSPEAKER_03:  a great, great, great exercise. It was amazing to hear from so many people across the city. People I've met before and just really heard more from. It just is so important that we continue to work together as we recover as a city and really lead America in the recovery. So thank you so much. This will conclude the meeting and we will open the full city council meeting. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Cheers. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, ma'am. Do we have a... \nSPEAKER_03:  General Public Common as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, no general public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  We \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  just \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, we got a vote. Vote should have a vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll make the motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sorry again. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's do a roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure, a mango. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Vice Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  KEL \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  motion carries and there's no further public comment."
