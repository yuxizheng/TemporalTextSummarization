Welcome to everyone to this meeting. This is our second day of interviews of applicants for the \nSPEAKER_04:  are redistricting commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  We thank you all for your time. \nSPEAKER_04:  and you're interested in serving. There's been a lot of interest, and we find that we have a lot of qualified. \nSPEAKER_04:  applicants. \nSPEAKER_04:  The process has been, as I think you probably know, that after outreach we had about \nSPEAKER_04:  400 applications staff reviewed them for basic eligibility. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then the Commission reviewed the applications. \nSPEAKER_04:  with all the personal information redacted and \nSPEAKER_04:  and chose we were divided ourselves into subgroups. We didn't. \nSPEAKER_04:  consider anyone. \nSPEAKER_04:  any districts. \nSPEAKER_04:  We did not consider our own district in making the selections. And \nSPEAKER_04:  selected five candidates from each district to move forward to the interviewing process. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we then developed this process to \nSPEAKER_04:  make further selections and from this group 20 to 30 applicants will be selected. \nSPEAKER_04:  And, and then there will be a random selection in accordance with the \nSPEAKER_04:  the charter amendment that the voters passed a couple years ago. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just to \nSPEAKER_04:  Let. \nSPEAKER_04:  Everyone know that's watching or \nSPEAKER_04:  involved in this process. We did determine last night that there had been an air \nSPEAKER_04:  It's a clerical error in \nSPEAKER_04:  transcribing the decisions of the \nSPEAKER_04:  some committees to the persons that were interviewed and this defect \nSPEAKER_04:  District. \nSPEAKER_04:  three, four, six, and nine, some of the people that were \nSPEAKER_04:  selected. \nSPEAKER_04:  were overlooked and a few others were invited for interviews that hadn't been selected. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the agenda for the Commission tomorrow. \nSPEAKER_04:  has been amended in order that we can address how best to handle that situation. \nSPEAKER_04:  In the meantime, we're going forward today with the interviews for districts five and six of us. \nSPEAKER_04:  of those people who \nSPEAKER_04:  We're selected by the subcommittees to be interviewed and will. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll deal with the \nSPEAKER_04:  the mistake that we discovered last night. \nSPEAKER_04:  tomorrow and and decide accordingly for that. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the way this is going to work today, the applicants will have five minutes to respond to three questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  And which you have been providing an advance and then there'll be a brief time for commissioners to ask follow up questions if they wish and take their notes and transition to the next applicant. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the plan is that in the next week or so, the final selection \nSPEAKER_04:  of this pool of \nSPEAKER_04:  more or less 45 applicants that have been selected will be narrowed down to 20 or 30 and the random drawing will take place. \nSPEAKER_04:  So with that said, um, \nSPEAKER_04:  Welcome and we'll go to the first applicant for today. \nSPEAKER_04:  who is \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_04:  Applicant CD 512 Stafford CAHC. \nSPEAKER_04:  And from this point on, the city clerk's office. \nSPEAKER_04:  JT Nagyama on your screen if you're watching we'll be calling you in and unmuting you as appropriate what it's time for you to talk. So \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much and \nSPEAKER_04:  JT, you can take it from here please. \nSPEAKER_07:  So our first applicant as chairwise stated is CD5-12, Stafford Cox, if you can unmute yourself, and you can begin your response to the questions. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm Stafford Cox and it would be an honor to serve on the Long Beach Independent redistricting Commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks to the passage of Measured DDD in 2018. \nSPEAKER_00:  We are now undertaking a fair and equitable process that will ensure \nSPEAKER_00:  And if we do it right, enhance public participation in our democracy. \nSPEAKER_00:  So to be fair and to get it right, let me list a few of my qualities that I believe would make me a valuable contributing member of the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  first. \nSPEAKER_00:  analytical with the touch of pragmatism. \nSPEAKER_00:  For example, statistics can measure levels of uncertainty. \nSPEAKER_00:  but not its interpretation. \nSPEAKER_00:  This requires experience and good judgment. \nSPEAKER_00:  You will also learn that I'm a team player, an active listener, and consensus builder. \nSPEAKER_00:  but perhaps the most important quality is that I love the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  my life. \nSPEAKER_00:  my family and my professional career are here. \nSPEAKER_00:  We are very fortunate to live in Long Beach. The city is a vibrant diverse community of commerce, educational opportunities, healthcare resources, and government services. \nSPEAKER_00:  The city is resilient and has \nSPEAKER_00:  Pretty good cuisine. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have all. \nSPEAKER_00:  the ingredients for a successful future. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I envision and appreciate all of the city's possibilities in moving forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  This year, however, we have been blindsided by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSPEAKER_00:  We've been given the impression that we could go back to work. \nSPEAKER_00:  in one or two months of self isolation with social distancing wearing masks and washing our hands. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  A little did we know. \nSPEAKER_00:  So. \nSPEAKER_00:  Here's a recent situation where I worked with others to jumpstart a canceled on-site student symposium. \nSPEAKER_00:  first the backdrop. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm an executive committee member of a statewide California State University Council. \nSPEAKER_00:  that sponsors an annual student symposium in the month of May. \nSPEAKER_00:  The symposium was to be held at CSU San Bernardino, but on March 12th, it all began to unravel. \nSPEAKER_00:  One by one, the CSU campuses moved to an alternative mode of instruction where students would study at home. \nSPEAKER_00:  and attend classes online. \nSPEAKER_00:  when the Chancellor's Office restricted travel. \nSPEAKER_00:  the on-site symposium. \nSPEAKER_00:  was cancelled. \nSPEAKER_00:  What? \nSPEAKER_00:  This is where \nSPEAKER_00:  Leadership comes to play. \nSPEAKER_07:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_00:  as an information technologist. \nSPEAKER_00:  I was in the position to propose to our executive committee that we could run an online symposium. \nSPEAKER_00:  Initially, some felt the effort was ill advised, but once San Jose State agreed to host the online symposium, and our registered students confirmed their willingness to present their research papers online. \nSPEAKER_00:  The 21 campus representative's agreed. \nSPEAKER_00:  Some joined in rebuilding this symposium as an online program, some as online session moderators and some as audience members. The community and I organize Zoom trainings, handouts and mock symposium sessions for the students to practice with their session moderators. \nSPEAKER_00:  This was all accomplished online without any in-person contact. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we rated the show. \nSPEAKER_00:  My three takeaways from this experience include. \nSPEAKER_00:  Do not despair when projects do not go as planned. \nSPEAKER_00:  Take a deep breath and strategize with your committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  The redistricting process will ask for no less than patients in perseverance in getting the job done. \nSPEAKER_00:  to singular announcements should be made when plans are rock solid for the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  Members should use discretion and let a communication specialist make any and all announcements. \nSPEAKER_00:  three. \nSPEAKER_00:  Take time to train the organizers or the commission members should be provided basic training with the necessary tools and support. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye, mate. \nSPEAKER_00:  My opinion. \nSPEAKER_00:  is that the commission's greatest challenge will be comparing the 2020 census data to our current \nSPEAKER_00:  District boundaries. \nSPEAKER_00:  I am aware that the census will be delayed and that our city will and all likelihood be undercounted. \nSPEAKER_00:  This will have ramifications on how the commission responds to communities of similar interests and other stakeholders. \nSPEAKER_00:  Regardless, the commission will need to be open, transparent. \nSPEAKER_00:  and inclusive of all our Long Beach residents using strict guidance in exercising impartiality when drawing the lines. \nSPEAKER_00:  This concludes my response, and I look forward to the opportunity to be of service. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Do any members of the commission have questions at this time for the applicant? \nSPEAKER_04:  Not seeing any? \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, then I think we're finished with your interview. Thank you very much, Mr. Cock. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I will call the next interviewer, please. \nSPEAKER_07:  Our next speaker, I'm sorry, our next applicant will be CD5-14, Sharon Diggs Jackson. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  if you can unmute yourself and we'll start your time. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, hello commission and again, it's an honor to be here actually. \nSPEAKER_06:  This is a very important task up in front of us, so the thought has been able to participate. \nSPEAKER_06:  is exciting to me. Just a little bit about myself. I was born and raised here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  I actually, after college, I work for IBM. \nSPEAKER_06:  for 10 years and then I came to work for the City of Long Beach and worked for the city for 20 years. \nSPEAKER_06:  had a very interesting career at the city. I was a very first civilian analyst that the police department ever hired. So I was involved in narcotics, neighborhood issues, as well as the crime analysis department. \nSPEAKER_06:  Left PD then went to the City Manager's office where I ran the neighborhood nuisance abatement program. \nSPEAKER_06:  which gave me a great understanding and an overview of our city as a whole city. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then I finished out my career the last 10 years and my career actually as the public information officer. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the noise officer at the airport. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the reason why I was sent to the airport was actually to work with the community to further engage the community and the airport to cross some boundaries and during my time at the airport we went from three flights a day to 41 flights a day. \nSPEAKER_06:  which entailed a lot of interaction with our community. \nSPEAKER_06:  which entailed our ability to be able to put together an education plan and to be able to work with the residents. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I think it's some of those skills is what I will bring to the commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  I do have some past experience with redistricting when I worked in the crime analysis department at the police department. \nSPEAKER_06:  But when I think about my experience at the airport, \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  helping our residents to understand what was the noise ordinance, how did it actually work? \nSPEAKER_06:  What was going to happen? How was it going to impact my neighborhood? \nSPEAKER_06:  And so my team, we put together a plan. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we implement it. \nSPEAKER_06:  It was new to me so I didn't know that much about noise monitoring. So the first thing we had to do was put together an education plan. \nSPEAKER_06:  to educate ourselves. \nSPEAKER_06:  We then have to look at what technology that we have at our disposal. \nSPEAKER_06:  in order for us to be able to one to do outreach to the community, but also. \nSPEAKER_06:  Do we have the latest and the greatest equipment to be able to track and monitor noise activity at the airport? \nSPEAKER_06:  Because keep in mind, we were going from three flights a day to 41 flights a day. \nSPEAKER_06:  So residents who had never experienced the playing fine over their house were now going to have 41 \nSPEAKER_06:  So there was a real need to do that education. \nSPEAKER_06:  So part of our plan, we upgraded all of the technology. \nSPEAKER_06:  all of the noise monitors at the airport. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  We're gonna halfway through. \nSPEAKER_06:  We're gonna have to wait through. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  The main principle we worked from was respect, respect for the individual. We recognized that for the most of the homeowners, \nSPEAKER_06:  That home was the most expensive purchase they probably would ever make in their life. So they were passionate about it. It meant something to them. So we worked from a point of respect and transparency. \nSPEAKER_06:  Our job was to get as much information to the community as we could. So we opened it up. We created new reports that told you every flight that's looting it out of the airport. We brought flight tracking where you can actually see the flights yourself and know what that flight was. \nSPEAKER_06:  But more so than that, we opened up our phones. \nSPEAKER_06:  We published our phone number everywhere. We told people to call us. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then when they called us, we answered their questions. We responded back to them. \nSPEAKER_06:  We also. \nSPEAKER_06:  working with our city prosecutor. We prosecuted and enforced the guideline. So for plain violated. \nSPEAKER_06:  We find them. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so it was that open dialogue and our ability to reach out to the community with a level of respect. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then surprisingly what happened, the number of calls that we used to get to complain reduced by 40%. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that was really because of education, transparency, and us bringing the level of respect to them. So as a group and as a collective project, that's something that I always like to... \nSPEAKER_06:  to talk a little bit about because I think we'll have to have some of those same skills as part of the redistricting community. We'll have to want to engage and answer questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  Some of the biggest challenges I think we'll have to understand that our city is changing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Our demographics has changed. If you look at the maps, our council district maps going back 10, 20, 30 years, you'll see that the dynamics of our city are changing. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then as we get ready for the new census data understanding. \nSPEAKER_06:  What does our city look like today? We know we have increased density in districts one and two. \nSPEAKER_06:  And in some of the other areas, we know District 5 is still the largest landowner. \nSPEAKER_06:  property. \nSPEAKER_06:  but we also know we don't have the population numbers in five. So there's a couple of objectives that the city always tries to... \nSPEAKER_06:  to meet when you're talking about our redistricting plans. So looking at the population distribution. \nSPEAKER_06:  is important, but then having respect for our neighborhoods is very important. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then we have to lay over that. How do we police? How do we provide emergency services? \nSPEAKER_06:  because our wrap up your comments. \nSPEAKER_07:  Drop up your comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  Our policing districts kind of play off as well of how we lay out and how we map out the city. So there's a number of challenges in front of us. I think technology. \nSPEAKER_06:  Having the data that we need will be very important. \nSPEAKER_06:  But then all of the commissioners will have to operate from a sensitivity to our own networks and our own council district, but citywide, how do we best serve our city and its totality. And there are really challenges about it. If you look at council district six and you compare that to council district five in terms of your time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, your time has elapsed. \nSPEAKER_06:  So thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do any of the commissioners have questions for the applicant? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any hands up or any nods of heads, so I think that completes that interview. Thank you very much. And we'll move to the next applicant. \nSPEAKER_07:  Our next applicant is CD5-16 Susanna Flores. \nSPEAKER_07:  If you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_07:  And you may begin. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm a name's Susanna Flores. I've been a resident in Long Beach for 27 years, 20 of those as a homeowner. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I'm going to go ahead and address question one. \nSPEAKER_01:  For me, what the qualities I come in with that could be of use to the independent redistricting commission would be first and foremost communication skills. I have a background of being a mental therapist for over 11 years. And currently I'm a forensic interview specialist. So it allows me to. \nSPEAKER_01:  look at problem sensitivity use the best listening active listening skills I can and ask for clarification and \nSPEAKER_01:  And do that vice versa with everyone to make sure that we're all understanding of one another. I'm also able to engage in dialogue, conversations, and discussions in a positive and productive manner. I also bring with me analytical skills, again, just based off of my professions. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm able to deconstruct information into smaller categories in order to arrive to a conclusion and or a decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  our strong logical reasoning, critical thinking, meaning process management, case analysis, finding correlations, evaluating information, and with that data analysis. I'm also good at integrating new information. \nSPEAKER_01:  to existing information in order to arrive to, excuse me, in order to enhance something that already exists or to improve it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I also am able to apply various legal concepts to matters at hand, although I don't have \nSPEAKER_01:  experience working with, um, like, yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  with laws related to independent district and commission. I am familiar with how to interpret laws given that with my profession as a forensic interview specialist. I do have to work with California penal code and I'm very familiar with that and I know when to seek guidance with respect to that. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other thing I'm going to be addressing now is question 2. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  And question two, our project goal was to open a satellite office. We had an existing children's advocacy center in a different city. We wanted to open one and a different city in order to provide services to children within a community. At the time I was the executive director of that CC. I went ahead and established a team that included members from our partner agencies, which included law enforcement. \nSPEAKER_01:  Deputy District Attorney's from the Ellie County District Attorney's Office as well as \nSPEAKER_01:  management from our Department of Children and Family Services along with social workers and then included also some mental health professionals from centers in that area. \nSPEAKER_07:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hopefully there's more. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I devise a strategic plan with timeframes due to the grant money is having a deadline conducted a needs assessment research all matters related to the grant and city city licensing requirements and delegated test to team members. \nSPEAKER_01:  Due to time constraints and budgets and the lack of the building space, I realized we wouldn't be able to open up a satellite office. So I instructed our team to look. \nSPEAKER_01:  to focus our efforts to neighboring cities. With that, we found an office space, but then we were confronted with another issue which was dealing with community members who weren't. \nSPEAKER_01:  So receptive to having as they're due to preconceived notions of what we did as a as a whole. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we created a list and organized that list of different community organizations, clubs and city representatives for us and my team to go out and speak to. So it can address the concerns that they have and it proved to be fruitful. \nSPEAKER_01:  to our coordinated efforts. We were then successful in opening up. That's that a light office. \nSPEAKER_01:  what I learned from that experience was to anticipate the unexpected and for steep potential problems and have a plan for those in case they should arise. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then to address the third question, one of the greatest problems that may have been, that may be encountered is misrepresentation of a community as a whole. \nSPEAKER_01:  In essence, having members of a group speak on behalf of an entire community while not representing the communities needs and instead using the independent redistricting commission for their political gain and or agenda. So in order to address this potential problem, I would suggest to the other commission members that we conduct an in-depth analysis of the current districts as it will serve to provide us with greater insight and understanding of communities with these boundaries. The analysis would include but not be limited to examining district maps, comparing resources, green districts, utilizing census data to help determine population diversity, comparing ratios to residential to businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  differences in population density as compared to land size. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are there protective project developments and if so, what could be the potential impact and does each district have equal representation language ethnicity socioeconomic levels and so forth. This type of information would be valuable when determining if a community is fully being represented. \nSPEAKER_01:  and properly surf. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that is my response. \nSPEAKER_01:  So thank you for that opportunity. \nSPEAKER_04:  for that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. Does anyone from the commission have questions for Ms. Flores? \nSPEAKER_04:  and that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any. \nSPEAKER_04:  And no hands. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, then I think the interview is done. Thank you very much for your time and your application. Please stay involved. Whatever happens here. We'll be making decisions in the next week or so. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_01:  for this opportunity as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Our next candidate is CD5-36, Felisa Ortiz-Licone. If you can unmute yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Nice to virtually meet you all. My name is Dr. Felisort-Thesley-Gone. I'm a lifetime resident of the city of Long Beach and a proud product of Long Beach Unified. \nSPEAKER_03:  I grew up in West Long Beach. I've lived in Cal Heights. I've lived in Berkeley. \nSPEAKER_03:  currently living in district five. \nSPEAKER_03:  As a young graduate student in region and urban planning, I had the privilege of working in the advanced planning division and \nSPEAKER_03:  conducting my master thesis. So I'm very much acquainted with the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  not only in neighborhoods, but \nSPEAKER_03:  So what are some qualities that are would bring to the commission? I pride myself in being a critical thinker, somebody who has a strong sense of integrity, and somebody who adheres by ethical behavior. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't only say this, I actually practiced it. I was recently, up until recently, in a pointee, a governor's appointee for the California State Board of Education. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I understand what this process can entail, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  It entails bringing together stakeholders, making sure that we have a clear understanding of the law. \nSPEAKER_03:  making sure that we're able to. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  consensus build and use data as our driving force in our analysis. \nSPEAKER_03:  As a state board member of education, we have the task of creating an accountability system for the state of California. \nSPEAKER_03:  that was based on the California and local control funding formula, which is a weighted funding formula. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the Federal Every Student Secrets Act. \nSPEAKER_03:  The federal and the state law were similar, but different in very substantial ways. One focused on districts, one focus on schools. We had to come up with state indicators, growth metrics, thresholds of data. And so this process entailed meetings with 150 plus public comment people that would come and \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, loads of buses and community members who really wanted to make sure that equity. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that um \nSPEAKER_03:  that quality education were reflected in the accountability system. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so for me, I understand what this process entails because I've lived through it and some of them are very political. Some of the decisions that have to be made with impartiality in mind, right, making sure that we're being driven by the data, making sure that we understand what the responsibility is, looking at federal law, looking at state law, looking at regulatory process and creating some processes. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I feel that in my time at the State Board of Education, I was able to do that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I also work for a national organization and we're in this role. I often have to give subgrounds. I have to review members. We're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_07:  We're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. I have to review applicants that are hoping to be part of fellowships, uh, state commissions. So I also understand that when we're selecting, uh, in different processes, we have to adhere by rubrics, we have to adhere by criteria. And these are things that I've been able to do while understanding that my role. \nSPEAKER_03:  is to really look at the data through an objective way, look at candidates, look at rubrics, and not personalized. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  In part, shelly, if it doesn't mean that you're going to get the outcome that you want, that it means that you respect the process. \nSPEAKER_03:  In terms of the challenges that I anticipate. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it's always difficult to be independent, right? I think that there is a lot of pressures. \nSPEAKER_03:  to not be independent because data could be looked in so many different ways. Boundaries can be \nSPEAKER_03:  lived in so many different ways. \nSPEAKER_03:  I previously worked for Los Angeles University in a five school district and we were tasked with a massive school construction program. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that entailed a broken eminent domain. \nSPEAKER_03:  And when we were looking to identify sites for school location, we often had to deal with city council members. We had to deal with boundaries jurisdictions. We had one school that actually straddle two cities to small cities in Southeast L.A. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I understand that this process involves mitigating, understanding, building consensus building and working through very \nSPEAKER_03:  layered conversations. \nSPEAKER_03:  But the role that I would hold is to be a consensus builder, to be somebody that's impartial, to be collaborative. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be analytical, to use my training in urban planning, my training as a somebody with a doctorate. \nSPEAKER_03:  and bring my skillset and my understanding of Long Beach to make Long Beach an inclusive city. \nSPEAKER_03:  That is truly representative of all the stakeholders in this great city that we have. So I thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_04:  questions from anyone? \nSPEAKER_04:  I mean, a problem with my screen here, sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  questions from anyone? \nSPEAKER_04:  I see none. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, then I think we're finished with your interview. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll move on to the next. \nSPEAKER_07:  Our next applicant is CD5-42, David Salazar. If you can unmute yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, well thank you for having me today in the interview and taking part in this application process. \nSPEAKER_08:  My name is David Salazar. I'm within a resident of Long Beach for close to six years. Now about five, five and a half years. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm also a graduate-long-week state. \nSPEAKER_08:  and familiar with the city. \nSPEAKER_08:  and um \nSPEAKER_08:  and sort of the various neighborhoods and, \nSPEAKER_08:  things that make up our great city here at Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think that, you know, I believe I'm a good candidate. And the reason for that is that my education \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm also, you know, a city planner, but also have an executive MBA. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I've filled roles throughout my career and senior management work. \nSPEAKER_08:  and have a deep knowledge of working with diverse populations along the way in a variety constituents. \nSPEAKER_08:  and stakeholders. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I believe in combination, I would be a great, you know, addition to the commission. \nSPEAKER_08:  based on those qualities. \nSPEAKER_08:  As far as question number two goes, I think the best way I can describe it is that. \nSPEAKER_08:  My career is based on my urban planning experience and my management experience. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, really I centered my career on campus planning and actually I was the \nSPEAKER_08:  Associate Vice President at Long Beach State. \nSPEAKER_08:  for close to nine years and leading their \nSPEAKER_08:  Capital Planning and Facilities Management Program. \nSPEAKER_08:  But before that, I had worked at Cal State Monterey Bay. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I was the chief planner in order and involved in the transition from four to four. \nSPEAKER_08:  to the 21st campus of the CSU system. \nSPEAKER_08:  any can imagine that that's a large undertaking. \nSPEAKER_08:  There were a lot of folks involved, the federal government, the local government. \nSPEAKER_08:  all the faculty, the staff, the local communities. \nSPEAKER_08:  et cetera. \nSPEAKER_08:  There was a group of us that went out there and actually got the work done. \nSPEAKER_08:  and we're successful in opening up the campus. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, \nSPEAKER_08:  The thing that I learned the most from that experience and I think that would translate very well into the commission is that. \nSPEAKER_08:  when working with multiple \nSPEAKER_08:  stakeholders and constituents and \nSPEAKER_08:  and voices. \nSPEAKER_08:  You have to be ready to obviously maintain the mission that you \nSPEAKER_08:  We're brought there to do or it's your task, but also \nSPEAKER_08:  flexible and understand that \nSPEAKER_08:  you know, there's always an issue of compromise. \nSPEAKER_08:  and that you have to be aware of and you have to \nSPEAKER_08:  actually execute. \nSPEAKER_08:  So no matter what you think the plan is and how much you're vested in it and all that. \nSPEAKER_08:  you know, the world of \nSPEAKER_08:  working through issues in a collective way and a collaborative way always involves compromise one way or another and those are about halfway through successful \nSPEAKER_07:  We're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_08:  The third question relates to the greatest problem. And I think the technicalities and all the technical work and the data close. \nSPEAKER_08:  that the commission is going to be faced with is one set of issues and they're important. But I think the bigger issue, the overarching issue would be to maintain independence. \nSPEAKER_08:  and to guard against intrusion from either political groups in the city or actually elected officials because \nSPEAKER_08:  what we're going to be undertaking on the commission is really \nSPEAKER_08:  the lifeblood and it's really going to determine sort of \nSPEAKER_08:  political careers. \nSPEAKER_08:  power structure, all those things that involved, you know, writing for office and representing a constituent base. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I think we have to be extra vigilant about that and make sure that \nSPEAKER_08:  the commission is is aware of those issues and to certain issue and to certain degree. \nSPEAKER_08:  make sure that they're insulated as much as possible from any of those outside influencers. \nSPEAKER_08:  So thank you again for giving me the opportunity for. \nSPEAKER_08:  to \nSPEAKER_08:  be a part of this application process and that concludes my remarks. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  Do any of the commissioners have questions from Mr. Salazar? \nSPEAKER_04:  No? \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, then I think your interview is completed. Thank you very much, Mr. Salazar. \nSPEAKER_04:  I believe this completes the interviews for District 5. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, that's correct. So we'll take a five minute recess, and then we'll let you know when we have the applicants for CD6. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, very well. We're in recess and thank you all. \nSPEAKER_07:  and we can start up again. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. Welcome. So this is the the interviews for district \nSPEAKER_04:  \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544 \nSPEAKER_04:  I previously provided some introductory remarks. I think most of you are familiar with the process that we've \nSPEAKER_04:  been following and we have \nSPEAKER_04:  two or three persons from \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  District 6 that have been selected by the committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_04:  that reviewed the candidates anonymously. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the process is today is that you'll each have five minutes to answer the three questions that were selected by the commission and distributed to you previously. And then there'll be a brief time for commissioners to ask questions if they wish and make their notes soon. \nSPEAKER_04:  and whatever before we move to the next applicant. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I'm going to let that city clerk stuff is called the \nSPEAKER_04:  the applicants because he's controlling the \nSPEAKER_04:  new to all those features of Zoom. So I do thank you for your participation. We found that we have a rich pool of applicants in the city of Juan Beach and \nSPEAKER_04:  and we appreciate your interest and hope you'll continue to stay interested in doing things. \nSPEAKER_04:  in the city. It's very, very important. So, J.K. \nSPEAKER_07:  Our first applicant is CD6-11 Alejandra Gutierrez. \nSPEAKER_07:  If you can not meet yourself in begin. \nSPEAKER_05:  Hello, I'm not sure about the process. Am I asked the question first or do I just go? \nSPEAKER_07:  You could just make your statement on the three questions that were emailed to you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, perfect. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So as far as college colleagues that I feel like possessed that would be an asset to the commission would be that I consider myself to be a very dependable and hard working individual. I am very committed to my work and to my city so I know that I will be. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner who brings my problem solving and \nSPEAKER_03:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_05:  a friendly demeanor to a commission that's charged with such a big task. \nSPEAKER_05:  I consider myself a quick study. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so I think I would be able to take on the role. \nSPEAKER_05:  quickly and be ready as soon as we start needing to. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  to work hard. \nSPEAKER_05:  I also feel that my experience as you may have seen in my resume. \nSPEAKER_05:  shows versatility of cast that I've had to \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, see through and has shown some leadership. So I hope that those things come through. So I believe that I have a few qualities that would be beneficial. \nSPEAKER_05:  to the commissioner ship. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  that's at stake here. \nSPEAKER_05:  for especially my district, just district six. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  an example of a task that \nSPEAKER_05:  or project that I've had to be a part of. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that had some complications would be. \nSPEAKER_05:  In my current position, I am a counselor at UC Irvine and one of the things that I oversee is the scheduling. \nSPEAKER_05:  of classes, so I'm the master scheduler for the School of Biological Sciences. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so when it is executing that role, there's a lot of things that I have to adhere to that is not just \nSPEAKER_05:  based in my school and biological sciences, but it has to adhere to policies and regulations that that you see eye campus needs to follow, but also you see as a system in California. So I am \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm very aware of the \nSPEAKER_05:  complications that may happen when there is an issue and there's multiple stakeholders with maybe countering needs. And so one of the more relevant examples to this position was a lab shortage that we had for our students. So there were a couple of years that \nSPEAKER_05:  We were seeing a spike in need in more classes and labs and there's a lot of restrictions that have to do with the low seats would be physical space funding teaching hours a lot of those things and so. \nSPEAKER_07:  We're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I was one of the first people to bring this problem to head and bring it to the attention of our leadership and I served as part of the \nSPEAKER_05:  Task Force to address this issue. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that was composed of \nSPEAKER_05:  myself serving as a liaison between staff, faculty, and students. And so \nSPEAKER_05:  when \nSPEAKER_05:  There were complications that was usually people feeling maybe that they had to compromise too much or they were tasked with \nSPEAKER_05:  having to give in or that was what they felt and so the way that I helped resolve that is \nSPEAKER_05:  taking a poll of \nSPEAKER_05:  What is it that you absolutely need to satisfy with the required of you under role in your department? \nSPEAKER_05:  Versus a lot. \nSPEAKER_05:  where can we see common ground and again just reminding everybody that the reason that this lab task force was created was to help our students and just reminding people of the goal help us you know \nSPEAKER_05:  do what we needed to do. \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, within the bounds that we have as, you know, staff or faculty or leadership or students. So \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that was. \nSPEAKER_05:  something major. \nSPEAKER_05:  that will impact. \nSPEAKER_05:  thousands of students and our curriculum and I think they adhere to \nSPEAKER_05:  all of the regulations that we had to adhere to. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  And finally... \nSPEAKER_05:  something that I think might be \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  or something that might prove difficult in \nSPEAKER_05:  in this monumentous task of having to \nSPEAKER_05:  draw new district lines. \nSPEAKER_05:  would be maybe similar to my lab task force is finding agreement between 13 people. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  doing something that's relatively new for our city. We just voted this in in 2018. So \nSPEAKER_05:  being new to that position and \nSPEAKER_05:  understanding that the drawing of these district lines are it's it's consequential it's going to have an effect for such a long time so that way of that duty. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll definitely be at the forefront and it might make us \nSPEAKER_05:  It might be something that would be difficult for 13 people to again. \nSPEAKER_05:  come to an understanding but I think with the same. \nSPEAKER_07:  please wrap up your comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  What the same idea of my lab task force just reminding ourselves of the task at hand, what's required of us and our time limits and that we're doing this for the residents of the city that we're so invested in. I think we could get the task done. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do any other commissioners have questions for Mr. Gutierrez? \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't see any. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, then the interview is completed. Thank you very much for participating and we'll be making the decisions in the next week or so. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great, thank you so much. Ah, \nSPEAKER_07:  Next applicant is CD6-19 Kelly Nim. \nSPEAKER_07:  If you can unmute yourself and begin. \nSPEAKER_07:  Kelly Nim, please. Oh, perfect. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi, my name is Tari Kelly-Nim. As you say, you can stay by Kelly-Nim. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  What are the specific quality you think? \nSPEAKER_02:  I have to fill for the independent redistrict. Well, first of all, I live with the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  and district. \nSPEAKER_02:  Pretty much all my life and I pretty much know. \nSPEAKER_02:  from the whole entire area. \nSPEAKER_02:  of the sector of the district six, that's including AOC sevens in the mid-time where I live. \nSPEAKER_02:  And also what I can bring to the table is that the experience that I have a group and in districts chicks. \nSPEAKER_02:  I can also can. \nSPEAKER_02:  benefit majority of the comei community, which is a very diverse comei community, Latinos and African Americans. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  independent district can also \nSPEAKER_02:  help a lot of the people that live there that can actually \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I can actually understand how we're going to be able to draw this map and then also \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  because I'm also familiar with the neighborhood leadership program. That's also taught me the value of \nSPEAKER_02:  working with a different district, but mainly the project I am an industry of district six, which I'm very, very familiar with. \nSPEAKER_02:  and also \nSPEAKER_02:  the experience that I have with working as a team. \nSPEAKER_02:  from my experience. I've been trained with Nape at Leisure Program. \nSPEAKER_02:  and also former Beverly Honeel, which is a student's conference for leadership. So it's taught me a value of working with different peers, different colleagues and different. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh \nSPEAKER_02:  a gender and how to elaborate and how to work things together. One of the examples I have is \nSPEAKER_02:  and what experiment that I have that are very \nSPEAKER_02:  challenging is my past experience working for law firm called White and Luna. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that is a location in our vine. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a very hard \nSPEAKER_02:  company that could be what we're family love. \nSPEAKER_02:  and my duty was as an accounting staff. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we have we have clients that comes in and all those clients are very \nSPEAKER_02:  I would call it a wealthy client, not just a regular, you know, regular clients. So they come in and they're trying to get the case solved and trying to, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  you know get the funding for the spouse or alimony support. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_07:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, one of the challenges that I have is that my project is I have to execute one of the clients account. \nSPEAKER_02:  And my former staff gave me a wrong case. And the case dates need to execute it on December before Christmas, on December 17. And the date cannot be on Saturday. I think the date was supposed to be prior on Thursday. So the date was giving to me wrong, and I had it on Saturday. And I had to re-evaluate because the client has to come on Friday to pick up. And then I asked my colleague. \nSPEAKER_02:  I said, you gave me this date. \nSPEAKER_02:  How can we solve this because the client is going to come pick up on Friday instead of Saturday? And she has to do backtrack because of the discovery backtrack. And they are apologized. As a team member, as a peers, as a colleague, we have to work this very calmly. We can't just, sometimes we can go off the wall. Sometimes we can get really aggressive. But if we do that, and nothing's going to be solved. So for myself, as coming in, as independent redistricted, \nSPEAKER_02:  I can work, I can take that to the next level because one is I already been here. I lived here for over 30 years of my life and I attended at Wilson High School, at 10 in the middle school. So I know all this, I know how to mitigate all this, I know how to work around it. I'm one of the other things, what's the challenge going to be with the Independent Restrict Commissioner? What's going to be the challenge? Well, here's the thing. If we have... \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm trying to come in where \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree what's the other party, the other one, Alejandro, she will mention about the 13, you know, \nSPEAKER_02:  13 staff, how's that going to work? You know, we have to see what can we do, what can we bring to table because we don't know what the next 10 years going to be like. \nSPEAKER_02:  We don't know what the outcome is going to be like. So we as a team, we as a staff, we're going to have to do that. We're going to have to bring to the table. What can we mitigate? Well, how can we approach that? And how can we do that as a team? And my sub coming in, it's going to challenge. It's going to work, but I'm willing to learn that. I'm willing to communicate with them. I'm willing to negotiate that. How we can draw the map. How we can pick? Because Long Beach is one of the diverse community, one of the diverse people, especially in the sixth district where I live. I see all the time. \nSPEAKER_02:  Like I just mentioned a lot. Please wrap up your comment. I speak come at. \nSPEAKER_07:  Please wrap up your comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm also, I took five years Spanish, so I speak Spanish too, in English. So I can bring the table to that. I can understand the community I live in. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm done. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  You are. \nSPEAKER_04:  And does anyone from the commission have questions for Ms. Niem? \nSPEAKER_04:  to see none. Thank you very much for interviewing and we'll be making our final decisions in the next week or so. \nSPEAKER_07:  And that concludes the applicants we have for today. The last one did not join the meeting today. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, then we can adjourn. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, and I just wanted to state that"
