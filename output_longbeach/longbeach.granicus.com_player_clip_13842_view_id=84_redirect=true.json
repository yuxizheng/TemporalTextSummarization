        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  moving forward the next agenda item and we have you read that as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  Item number two is recommendation to adopt resolution to approve the equity and human relations commission by laws. \nSPEAKER_00:  So what we're about to... \nSPEAKER_00:  here and engaging is a presentation that's really the fruit of the labor of this body. \nSPEAKER_00:  and in particular staff and important Taylor Anderson attorney who listened to our comments and recommendations at the last meeting and revised the document to ensure that it met the needs in terms of historically how this body has operated but moving forward was going to actually help move the work forward. So where she's going to go ahead and present to us a framing of what we have in front of us and then we'll have a discussion if any and then hopefully move towards the book. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, Chair. So. \nSPEAKER_06:  going to give you a presentation tonight. Very broad overview of what the bylaws say. If you have not read them, really encourage you to read them. They're an important document. I did not. \nSPEAKER_06:  Write them for me. I wrote them for you, right? And so \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm hoping that like the chair said they accurately reflect what this commission is about, I think. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we've been able to capture the way that this body operates. I am not, you know, as the chair said, I'm not going to be here for your meetings. It's really important for you to take ownership as a body for not just what these bylaws say, but also procedurally how you operate. You know, I was talking to the chair. \nSPEAKER_06:  And some of the commission members before the meeting started, you are a body of 15 people when all the seats are full and all the people are here. That is a lot of voices to have in the same room. \nSPEAKER_06:  You don't have the luxury that a smaller body of like five or seven has in relaxing on decorum and relaxing on the types of rules that we're going to talk about today. It just it won't be an efficient meeting. I can promise you that. The work of this body is very important. You're giving a voice to a lot of people who historically have not felt like they had voices in the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  You, I think, have capacity and the ability to say hard things sometimes that need to be said. But those hard things are not going to be said. \nSPEAKER_06:  If y'all can't get a recommendation out. \nSPEAKER_06:  And you can't get a recommendation now if you can't run an efficient meeting. So I know it's a lot of lawyer stuff. I know it's not the coolest part of being a commissioner, but it is an incredibly important part of being a commissioner. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so the more each of you as individuals can take ownership, not only of understanding procedurally how the meeting works, respecting the chair, but also what your bylaws say and honoring the things that you're all agreeing to tonight, the more work that you're going to be able to do and the more good and change that you can effectuate in this city. So with that, we'll get into the overview. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, Quorum. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, that's really far away. There we go. My vision's not that good. So, quorum for this body, we've talked about it. Adnazium is eight members of the commission is required to hold a meeting. You have 15 seats. The way that quorum is measured is half plus one. So half of 15, I think, is seven and a half. So you just round to the nearest number, that's eight. So what happens when you lose quorum? That's a real thing that can happen. I know that we're all busy people. Sometimes we have to leave. But be mindful of when you're leaving. \nSPEAKER_06:  you lose quorum or you could lose quorum right if you're the eighth person if that happens the meeting has to come to an end the commission can no longer conduct business if you know that you have obligations I really encourage you to speak to Tony and the chair so that they're aware and can manage \nSPEAKER_06:  whether or not we're going to have quorum and maintain it for your meetings. \nSPEAKER_06:  The chair or co-chair must adjourn the meeting to another time, place, and date if quorum is lost. And then if the commissioner, we don't have any commissioners present, none of you show up. The, the, I hope that never happened. But the clerk or the commission liaison staff can adjourn the meeting for lack of quorum. \nSPEAKER_06:  So advocacy, this was a really important part of your bylaws. I can tell you. \nSPEAKER_06:  My understanding is that this is unique to this commission of the authority that you grant to all commissioners So commissioners can advocate to city officials regarding a position adopted by the commission And then you can advocate as a member of the public at any time of course you always have that first amendment right We just ask that you identify that you're not speaking as a commissioner that you're speaking in your personal capacity your capacity for work Whatever it is that's not you being a commissioner not a position adopted by the commission So what commissioners cannot do is advocate or take a public position as a commissioner of this body If the commission hasn't voted to adopt the position or recommendation so \nSPEAKER_06:  Commission has to agree. You act and you make decisions as a body, even though as an individual you are a commissioner, your voice is one voice. \nSPEAKER_06:  commission liaison that's Tony. \nSPEAKER_06:  So. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you don't have a commission, a city clerk staff assigned to the commission, the commission liaison has a lot of responsibilities that usually are handled by the clerk's office. You're very lucky to have. Madam clerk here with you, it makes the meeting a lot easier. It makes Tony's job a lot easier, definitely when we're here. So they have to prepare the agenda of the regular and special meetings, arrange proper legal notice of hearings. You don't really have hearings, but in case, attend a correspondence of the public that comes in for the commission. Perform duties normally carried by the secretary to a legislative body, so a lot of note-taking. Our minutes are short and nice and rebate the way they are because we have the luxury of recording. Our meetings, either orally or video and orally. If we did not do that, the minutes would be... \nSPEAKER_06:  old time me and very long and it's a lot of work to do it so \nSPEAKER_06:  Yay for technology, yay for TID. We thank them for their service. And then keeping them in the midst of the commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  So your access to staff, commissioners and the commission request for assistance or research by city staff other than a simple request for information have to require consent and approval of the commission liaison. That's because what we don't want is that we understand your want and need to have information and to get things done. We wanna make sure that you're acting as a body when you're asking for those things and we're not traveling on a path that it's you as an individual, not you as a collective body. \nSPEAKER_06:  With that too, if it's a request for records, you do have a right still as a resident of the city, as a human, actually, as a living, breathing human being, you have a right in the state of California to public records. So if it is a public record, you can request that. \nSPEAKER_06:  So onboarding of new commissioners this was an ad from the last meeting. An officer of the commission, when we say officer we mean chair, vice chair or co-chairs. Or other commissioners selected by the commission agrees to meet with new commissioners to provide. \nSPEAKER_06:  A brief history of the commission, context to the work of the commission, a copy of the bylaws, including the community agreements, a copy of the commission's roadmap or whatever strategic plan that you have at the time. \nSPEAKER_06:  So officers of the commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  I know this one was hard to put pictures in. I'm sorry. The other one I have my bitmoji. And so it's like hopefully less boring, but I get it. \nSPEAKER_06:  So you'll elect two officers in July of each year that's required by the municipal code. Officers assume \nSPEAKER_06:  office in August and the term is for one year. These are all dictated by the municode. You can't serve as an officer for more than two consecutive terms. And then what's unique to this commission is that at each election the commission decides as a body whether or not they're going to elect officers as either a vice chair chair or co-chair structure and we'll go over what that means in a little bit. And then vacancies in chairs of officers must be filled immediately, immediately usually means at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  You all don't have to have a special meeting to fill your officers, right? \nSPEAKER_06:  So when we have a chair, vice chair structure, \nSPEAKER_06:  Chair typically presides over the meetings of the commission and has the new duties normally granted to the chair of a body And I've outlined them on the co-chair side and then the vice chair acts for the chair in the chair's absence And if there's no chair vice chair president at the meeting you as a body can elect what's called a chair pro-tem and it's a chair for the meeting \nSPEAKER_06:  Their power is limited to that meeting and just running the meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you have a different circumstance, we're both the chair and the vice chair are gonna be out for a long time. You should call me. Even though I'm not going to be here and even though I have a lot of other things that I'm responsible for, I still, as I told the chair, I will always make space for you. You just have to communicate what your need is so that I can respond to it, right? I'm happy to answer your legal questions, so. \nSPEAKER_06:  Officers for co-chair structure. This is a robust slide. The chair has a lot of responsibilities. This isn't even... \nSPEAKER_06:  the responsibility really of what we're going to cover the chair does during the meeting that will be in the later presentation. So because presiding over meetings is one bullet point but there's a lot of sub bullets for that one. Okay. So. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  The chairs have to the co chairs have to agree on how they're going to divide responsibility And that responsibility is who presides over the meeting they have the choice to alternate if one person wants to run the meeting and you know Advice the different co chair prefers to not run the meetings, but do more administrative stuff. That's okay They have to come do an agreement Monitoring and facilitating the commissions progress on the roadmap setting and approving the agenda for commission meetings Signing correspondence on behalf of the commission. So like your recommendations that get sent to council those would \nSPEAKER_06:  be signed by the chair or co-chairs. Approving and signing commission reports to the City Council, including the annual report that you're supposed to be submitting on the things that you've done for this year. Monitoring commission dynamics and supporting guiding coaching commission members inside and out of the public meetings. We'll talk about it more in the next presentation, but respect and decorum are really important in operating as a public body. And it's how business gets done. So treating each other with respect is number one rule. The chair is really a referee to make sure that you're continuing on that path. \nSPEAKER_06:  You can represent the Commission at external events. Speaking to the City Council and public comment on behalf of the Commission. Y'all can actually do that. \nSPEAKER_06:  but that's typically a duty assigned to the chair. And then preparing recommendations for the commission's consideration. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this slide. We've had this discussion a few times over standing committees. You do have regulations on how they work in your bylaws. But at this time, this commission has agreed that we're not going to pursue standing committees just because of the resources from a staff and then facilities standpoint that it would take and time. Standing committees have to be public and Brown Act notice meetings. They have to be open. So there's a lot that goes along with that. \nSPEAKER_06:  If we change course and start doing standing committees, let's have a meeting about it so we can talk about how to facilitate it in the best way, and most transparently. \nSPEAKER_06:  ad hoc committees. We had a few changes to this provision to make sure \nSPEAKER_06:  Preserving the intent of what this commission wanted so it has to be less than a quorum of the commission It's not required. These aren't required to be brown act notice and open to the public \nSPEAKER_06:  So you're using them on a limited basis where you are interested in setting something in greater depth than what's allowed in the couple of hours that you have here once a month. \nSPEAKER_06:  It has to be for a limited and finite purpose and limited scope that can be accomplished within a reasonable amount of time. If the ad hoc's don't, I don't think we talked about this last time. It says in your bylaws that if the ad hoc's don't accomplish their purpose by the end of the calendar year, that they have to be dissolved. \nSPEAKER_06:  You can reappoint members in January. \nSPEAKER_06:  But you have to affirmatively agree that the work of that ad hoc should continue as a body. It doesn't just continue automatically. So something to think about when you're working through the ad hoc item tonight of wearing a October. So we have a real conversation in January. \nSPEAKER_06:  about continuing the work of the commissions. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the bylaws now recommend that no more than four members are per ad hoc committee, but you can have up to seven because a quorum is eight. So as long as you have less than seven, we talked about this a little bit at the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  for efficiency purposes. In the fact that you have so many people on this body, I really recommend that you keep your ad hoc's to a small number. It makes it of the people who should be at the table. It makes it a lot more efficient to come to a recommendation and an agreement on something to present to the whole body. \nSPEAKER_06:  been having a lot of voices in the room. The opportunity for all the voices to be heard is at the full commission meeting. Think of \nSPEAKER_06:  Think of the commission like a cruise ship? \nSPEAKER_06:  the ad hawks are the dinghy. \nSPEAKER_06:  Right? It's a lot easier for them to navigate and move around. And so think of that, them from that perspective, from an efficiency standpoint. And if you want them to be as efficient as possible, to bring back recommendations to the body. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you're going to serve on more than one ad hoc committee, I would just ask that you consult with my office before you do it on what the plan is, what you currently have in place, what the overlap is. At the end of the day, you as individuals are responsible for complying with the Brown Act. I can't do that for you. My office can't do that for you. I can tell you how to do it. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we just had a presentation on the Brown Act being mindful of if you're talking to someone about an item, you shouldn't be talking to more than seven people about it. And if you're on an ad hoc, you should pretend that there's a wall between you and the other commissioners about whatever you're working on the ad hoc. And you should honor that boundary. One for the public trust, number one for the public trust. And to ensure that you're complying with the Brown Act and keeping each other accountable. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, Ann. \nSPEAKER_06:  The majority of a commission can terminate an ad hoc committee through an agenda item. So if you think that I hope it never gets to this point, if you have an ad hoc that you're like, oh jeez, this is really off the rails and this isn't productive at all. The whole body can make an agreement to end it. I hope that that doesn't happen to you, but you have that emergency parachute to end the ad hoc if you need to. \nSPEAKER_06:  Otherwise, they get dissolved as soon as their purpose is complete. \nSPEAKER_06:  accessibility. This was something that got added in the last meeting. There are priorities that you want to consider when you think about locations that you have public meetings. Number one, required by the Brown Act, required by federal law, complying with the American with Disabilities Act as number one. And then making sure that the space allows for the public to provide virtual public comment and view the meeting virtually. And really participate in live time. And then the space is located within communities that have historically been underserved and underrepresented in the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  parliamentary procedure. \nSPEAKER_06:  So this commission and all commissions and city council are governed by Robert's rules. We'll get into that in my next presentation. Bilos can be amended by affirmative vote of a simple majority, which is eight votes. During a properly agendas item, you can't surprise amend the bylaws. And then you can suspend the bylaws for meeting by affirmative vote of a simple majority of at least eight votes. So if there's rules in the bylaws, states will recognize thecek vo CS\u6642\u9593 people get laid off stronger seconds of legitimacy time. \nSPEAKER_06:  For some reason, they don't serve you for one agenda item or for an entire meeting. The whole body can agree to stop. \nSPEAKER_06:  using those rules. \nSPEAKER_06:  agenda, a couple key things here. \nSPEAKER_06:  Most important, like a lot of this is Brown Act. The chair can rearrange items on the agenda with the consent of the commission. I really recommend that we don't do that unless you have to. Like the change tonight, that makes sense. It probably should have been set up that way in the first place from like a logic standpoint. But taking things out of order, it's harder for the public to follow the meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  the public, you know, they scheduled their time to come here. They sometimes gauge of like, oh, I should show up a little bit later because this agenda is the item that I care about, deeper in the agenda. I only have so much time. So when you move things out of order, \nSPEAKER_06:  you know they miss opportunities to provide public comment and that's why we're here. So we do this for the public as a public service and to represent the public in their opinions. So it also makes it harder for the commissioner to follow and then I'm not even going to mention Madam Clerk of her having to track how you know how the agenda goes in the minutes it's a whole thing. So be kind to your Madam Clerk and the public try to take things in order when you can. If you object you can object to the chair taking items out of order but if you don't it's assumed that everybody can sense. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then written documentation. \nSPEAKER_06:  submitted after 12 o'clock on the meeting day isn't considered. Most of that's because the probability that you're going to see whatever that is is very low. \nSPEAKER_06:  and that you're going to read it and digest it and understand what it says. So that's why we have this cutoff in here. \nSPEAKER_06:  agenda order. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the agenda order changed from the last time that we presented the by-laws to you. That was at the request of the clerk's office. We are getting very nice, exciting new software that is going to hopefully be more accessible. It provides transcripts of the meetings. I'm like, I'm probably the most excited about the software in the city. It's all kinds of really good stuff, hopefully shooting to make things more efficient for everybody. Part of that is everyone, all the commissions adopting agendas that look similar so that the computer system can account for it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Negotiated to here. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the meeting procedure and the land acknowledgement will happen in the chair remarks instead of being its own item. Most of the things that were included in your original agenda order were really to acknowledge. \nSPEAKER_06:  regular agenda items that you \nSPEAKER_06:  happen have all the time. So those things will still happen under the regular agenda and then public comment announcements turn red. \nSPEAKER_06:  written recommendations to the council. There was a red line clarifying the information in this section. \nSPEAKER_06:  to really hone in on the fact that this section was about written recommendations to the council specifically. \nSPEAKER_06:  What that means is that this body requests that anything that's transmitted to the city manager for Council One you ask that it's transmitted within 30 days or sooner of when you adopted or finalized it \nSPEAKER_06:  the recommendation is transmitted unaltered and that the recommendations from the city manager staff contrary to what the commission is saying is sent separate and then the basis for that why their recommendation is different not just like we think this is terrible like okay say why you think that articulate it in the basis and that the chair or co-chair will get noticed if there's going to be a recommendation sent by staff or the city manager that's different than what the commission adopted. \nSPEAKER_06:  community agreements. We didn't really talk about this last time that much. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that this is a very important part of \nSPEAKER_06:  One, this body, two, \nSPEAKER_06:  Creating a space when you're talking about the hard things, which like let's be real 99% of what you're talking about is a hard thing, that everybody's voice is being heard and that everybody's being represented and everyone's showing up with respect. When we talk about Robert's rules, there's a really big vent diagram, middle part of the things that we... \nSPEAKER_06:  This commission has adopted here. \nSPEAKER_06:  And what Robert's rules is talking about. I know it sounds like parliamentary procedure, you're like. \nSPEAKER_06:  And it was like... \nSPEAKER_06:  old dudes and powdered wigs, right? It's more than that. It's really at the core of it, it's talking about these things and the community agreements. So when we say community agreement, \nSPEAKER_06:  We're saying that it's the expectation for how the members of this commission aspire to work interact with each other. The intent of you adopting these is to create a productive space during meetings that it's supportive, respectful, ethical, safe, welcoming, and inclusive. And where all members have an opportunity to be heard. \nSPEAKER_06:  The purpose is to help create an environment where all members are encouraged to participate in ways that support their individual and collective success. You know, today I was reflecting on this commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think we're short people, but there's some people I'm not sure I've ever heard them talk. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that's not how it should be, right? You're on this commission because you're an important member of our community. The mayor did not select you on accident. You were in a firm by council on accident. So use that voice, right? \nSPEAKER_06:  And maybe you're not an extroverted person. That's okay, but it's important for you to share your opinion, even if it's a short opinion about whether you disagree or agree on something or you think, don't go home and tell your spouse, like, gosh, we adopted the worst recommendation today. And you didn't say anything during the meeting. That's not why you're here. It's not in here too for abstentions. You can't abstain. \nSPEAKER_06:  unless you either have a conflict or a majority of the commission votes that you are allowed to abstain. Right? You're here. Have a voice. Be proud of what your answer is on whether you believe in something or not. I think that that's what makes a lot of the people here unique and special is not being afraid to say those hard things. And I think that that's why the mayor put you here. So I encourage you to do that. But in a like, \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  respectful hashtag decorum, you know kind of a way. \nSPEAKER_06:  Community agreements. \nSPEAKER_06:  Be present and share the air. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would also, before I really get into this, would like to give credit to your equity office. They are the ones that provided the majority of these and the chair and vice chair. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we encourage full participation from everyone through activist making room for others and limiting distractions when we're working together. We're not texting on our phones, we're paying attention to what the discussion is. And even when the presentation is boring, we're paying attention, right? \nSPEAKER_06:  Use eye statements we speak from our own experiences rather than generalizations. \nSPEAKER_06:  Assume the best intent but attend to impact. We give each other the benefit of the doubt and are accountable for our words. When we were looking through this, one of the things I saw was like an out approach. \nSPEAKER_06:  when hard things that maybe hurt someone else are said, a different community agreement, it's not in here, that it's okay to say ouch, and acknowledge that it hurt you. \nSPEAKER_06:  and that it's something that you carry, right? But that the person didn't mean any harm by it, right? Like we were talking about earlier, you're here to do good things. You're not here maliciously to hurt each other in a public setting. That's not why we're here, right? So embrace your position as a learner and a leader. \nSPEAKER_06:  We have something to offer, which means we can learn from others in this space. We are not all experts. I'm sure that there's things that you have expertise about, but being open and listening to other perspectives. \nSPEAKER_06:  acknowledge the intersections, our background and our biases uniquely shape our experiences and understanding. Therefore, we all benefit and are harmed by systems of oppression. The truths that we speak are valid and they are ours alone. \nSPEAKER_06:  Expect and accept nonclosure. We engage in courageous conversations and acknowledge that the challenges we address may not be resolved right away. I would say that's like a lot of what you're doing. And that's okay. But, you know, there's that joke. How do you eat an elephant? \nSPEAKER_06:  It's like, how do you solve racism is one bite at a time, right? These are things that like, it's a thousand small decisions, it's a thousand small recommendations to chip away at the structure to make a change for a lot of the things historically that maybe shouldn't have happened and still need changing. It's little steps and being okay with the fact that you're not going to have a concrete like \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, this project is done. It's going to be this recommendation is done, right? So... \nSPEAKER_06:  One thing at a time and it's okay that it's not done. \nSPEAKER_06:  Center these most impacted equity means all and to achieve this we center the most impacted by the issues we address. Acknowledge the intersections. Our background and biases uniquely shape our experiences and understanding. They're up for we all benefit and are harmed by systems of oppression. The truth that we speak are valid and there are alone. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then confronting social justice is painful and joyful. We acknowledge this bright dream of feelings. Everyone will experience as we engage in transformational work. Wait, why am I talking? I think this one specifically came from the vice chair. We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing and sharing ideas. If you notice, you've commented several times while others haven't. Maybe pause for a bit longer to give others a chance to respond. We also ask for your comments. We are on topic and relevant to our presenters discussion. \nSPEAKER_06:  as a teaser for the next presentation. That's a huge part of Robert's Rules of Order and the Brown Act of things being on topic and something that the chair is facilitating, right? So, but take ownership, you're not a backseat driver to being participating in the commission, you're an active part of this. So it's not just the chair's responsibility to acknowledge when people are speaking multiple times, but it's your responsibility as a commissioner to make space for the other commissioners. So that is the end of my presentation. I'm available for questions. I'm hoping. \nSPEAKER_06:  So if we have more changes tonight, we'll have to come back. Please don't change it just so I can come back. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if you have some snips just changes beyond and \nSPEAKER_06:  want modifications to the red line that was done, it will require this to come back. \nSPEAKER_00:  Taylor, I understand I want to applaud you for a robust presentation and speaking from experience in this particular world of inter-secondality and equity as an academic, not only was it a presentation on the by-laws, but we saw from the community, you know, a lot of stuff related to the academic world, which informs our work. And that gratitude goes for everyone involved. And this has been months in the making and we are here to abide by the actual procedures to get this actually approved. I want to move to public comment first and then see if there are any questions or perhaps comments from fellow commissioners. And I can see from the screen we already have an active motion to pass from commissioner Schultz and seconded by Kamacho, but then we'll go through the procedures first and then we'll go for the vote. Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_06:  Real quick, let me add one more thing that I didn't acknowledge and then we can go on a public comment. There is a section that outlines how motions work and like the basic and friendly I didn't want you to suffer through that twice. We're going to cover that in the next presentation, but there is information that we've included in there for you on motions and how those things work too. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  That was quite the teaser indeed. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number two here in person, please line up at the podium at this time. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing none in person. If there are any members of the public in the Zoom that would like to speak on item number two, please use the raise hand feature now or dial star nine if calling in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment for item two. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you Madam Clerk. I'm not going to turn to fellow commissioners to see if there are any questions or comments responses from the presentation. We just witnessed. \nSPEAKER_00:  Oh, I forget to look at my screen here. Hold on. I'm coming. Come here, sure, good to hear. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy City Attorney, Taylor. Really appreciating the bylaws presentation and just the bylaws in its totality. I served as Chair for three years without any bylaws. And I will tell you this would have been so much. \nSPEAKER_05:  more efficient, you know, under my leadership, but that's okay. We are here now and it's still meaningful. So just appreciating your work. I have a few comments, but also a couple questions. My first question I will ask is, if there is a change to something that you have presented in this draft by-laws, is it gonna require us to come back automatically, or if it's maybe like a slight change when we agree to it, can we avoid that? That's my question. \nSPEAKER_06:  It depends, I know that's the worst attorney answer I can give you. I think it depends if you have a bunch of punctuation corrections, I will humbly just make the corrections. But if they're substantive and really the degree of how substantive they are, if it's a little bit of a wordsmithing of like, I missed the mark maybe from an equity standpoint, I really hope I didn't do that. But and you're like, we'd prefer language that's this and it represents the same concept. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm open to just striking and making the change on the floor, but I think I need to hear some weird that you're sitting right here. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'll need to hear the changes that you want to make, and then we can go from there on whether it needs to come back or not. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Similar to the redistricting commission, there is not enough seats there for the number of commissioners Let's be on time. Okay, so my question then I'll start there \nSPEAKER_05:  One of my question was the chair pro-tem, one of the things that we had discussed in the last meeting to my recollection would be that the chair pro-tem in the event that the chair and the vice chair or let's say the co-chairs were both not available to be at a particular meeting. Then that role would fall to the senior most commissioner on the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  That was my recollection from the last meeting. If I mean, my memory could be wrong. So I just want to clarify that. And if we were going to make that kind of change, would that require you coming back? Because I also like as much as possible, I don't want you to have to come back because we've done so good at this. \nSPEAKER_06:  So that would be something where we would have to bring it back at third time. \nSPEAKER_06:  But you can't so \nSPEAKER_06:  I apologize because that wasn't in my notes. And I think the minutes when I looked at them, \nSPEAKER_06:  So I'm not sure if it made it when I read the motion back to you of what we were agreeing to because it wasn't in my notes. I'm not sure that made the cut. If you want to make that change we can bring it back. If you know that's the only change. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I'm sexy. \nSPEAKER_05:  I can see what the other commissioners think. If it's not, I'm not, like, that's that on it. I know that it was something that we talked about as something that had been a precedent for our commission. And I think that was really to minimize, I think, the, like, disruption that would be inherent if a chair and a vice chair were both not present. This came up actually one time in our history and that, at least the history that I've been on this commission and I think that's most of us, at the retreat. I had left the room momentarily and I think someone else, a vice chair, Erickson, was not there. And so in that moment it was like a split decision we had to make that with me out of the room and I needed to be away for about 30 minutes, who was in charge. And so we made a really quick decision, the senior most member. And because that had been our precedent. So I just, I recall that experience as something that was very quick. We know who it is. And it doesn't require this whole election and the party has to choose. And because usually like I don't know. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I feel those instances are a few and far between and so something like that I think would be beneficial. However, if there is a strong desire to pass these bylaws as they are today, I'm also not going to oppose that. \nSPEAKER_05:  That scenario came up again and we needed to go through this whole process to determine who that chair pro Tem is I would be on board with that. But just wanted to provide that context, remind the folks of what happened in November when that scenario came up from the for the first time that I've been on this commission and how we handled it. \nSPEAKER_06:  So something that you could do as an alternative is like \nSPEAKER_06:  If that situation ever rises, you can nominate the most senior member. It's possible that the most senior member might not want to be the chair of the meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  and so allowing space for other people to be nominated to. So that change can be made. That might be an alternative so that they don't have to come back. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, actually while you're talking about it, I'm going to check the minutes to make sure that I'm not totally missing the mark. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, okay, so that was one question that I had. The other question was, \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, okay. So the other question that I had was around commission or comments. And you know what, this didn't come up in the last meeting. So again, this is something new. Don't want to throw the whole process off. So \nSPEAKER_05:  something that I know City Council had adopted recently. I want to say in the last year or so, maybe two years at this point, was to actually limit council members' comments at a particular time. I don't know what the actual legal framework is, but I was wondering if we wanted to add something like that to our commission, \nSPEAKER_05:  But if we did add something like that, it sounds like it might need to come back. So I'm trying to avoid that. \nSPEAKER_06:  I feel like you're just trying to find reasons so that I have to come in November. I respect that. So I actually worked on that ordinance. So the rule for council is that each council member has five minutes to speak. And there's a clock that gets put up on the big screen when they're speaking. \nSPEAKER_06:  It wasn't adjustment for them when they first adopted. It was actually made \nSPEAKER_06:  Council meetings more efficient believe it or not by like a lot so \nSPEAKER_06:  We talked about adding them and by we, I mean the chair, vice chair, myself and staff. \nSPEAKER_06:  We ended up concluding. \nSPEAKER_06:  that though that was an option, that we didn't see consistently that there was one \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner, sorry there's too many C words. There's what, you know, we didn't have a problem necessarily with commissioners speaking for long periods of time. It was more of \nSPEAKER_06:  the repeated speaking and maybe not making space for other commissioners, but their comments tended to be like informally under five minutes. Where council sometimes get, they get on a roll and they can talk for long periods of time. \nSPEAKER_06:  And it doesn't. \nSPEAKER_06:  And each one of them has an important thing to say and to represent the constituents, and that turns into a long meeting. So we intentionally left that out because when we were looking at ways to make the body more efficient, community agreements was where we ended up landing as the most appropriate mechanism for the way that this body behaves the way that the members are and that you operate. So you absolutely can do it. It's something that can be added. It would need to come back to the next meeting. But like I said, I'm not sure. It might be best to pilot the community agreements and all of you making a concerted effort to adhere to them and to focus on understanding what the procedural rules are and operating within them. And like if it's in six months or in four months, you're like, this is not getting better. Let's revisit what that looks like and other strategies to try to make the meetings more efficient and talk about it. And then we can... \nSPEAKER_05:  and I'm in the bylaws at that point. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, thank you for that. And I'm glad that you all had thought about that, consider that because I do absolutely trust the chair and vice chair around, you know, where you all landed on that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Quick clarifying question though, when that kind of timer starts for city council does it also include this kind of back and forth that we're having right now where I ask a question and then you respond like is that all included in the time frame? And I'm also asking these questions just so you all know really with the intention of making sure that we have the most efficient meetings possible. So that's the promise. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, I'm getting nods from across the room that is correct. That includes staff questions. So and council's able to queue back up as many times as they want. But it basically forces them to move. \nSPEAKER_05:  space for other people. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So if we had that rule on the books right now, my time would be up already. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, just clarifying. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, I do have one last comment and I will make space for others. So glad to know and I'm okay with leaving it out of the bylaws if your analysis shows that it's not something that may be particularly needed at this time for commission, which is good to know. My last, it's just a comment that I wanted to make sure that it's on record. And I heard the section around advocacy, our deputy city, I'm sorry deputy city attorney made a comment that part was really particular to our commission and it was around like commissions advocating in the way that we have decided to share power in this commission around advocating. And I just thought that was really interesting because a personal mission of mine as a commissioner and when I was chair has been really to empower the other commissions in the city to know their role, to know what what their power is in the city as a commissioner, to be able to really elevate their voice and the voices of their constituency, their communities that they're serving, to really serve as that bridge between community and the institutions that are making decisions for the communities that we serve. And so it was just a comment that I wanted to take the opportunity to really just shine a light on is that I really hope to see more commissions really feeling empowered to advocate in the way that the EHRC advocates and elevates concerns and issues for community. So the more that we can be allies on that as commissioners to fellow commissioners, I would really encourage you all to lean into. So that is it around that and thank you. Thank you. Deputy City Attorney. You're just going to. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Commissioner Gutiores for those good questions, so that we should consider a commissioner. Camacho. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I just appreciate the, I just wanted to thank you for your work, but really appreciate the inclusion of the community agreements. I think addresses the concerns that Commissioner Grittier has brought up. So I just wanted to really applaud the \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair and Vice Chair for working with the and the work of the equity office for including the community agreement. So thank you. That's it. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you Commissioner Commissioner, Commissioner Dr. Betz. \nSPEAKER_03:  Taylor, Equity Office, and Chair and Co-Chair. This is great. I definitely applaud how this is all put together very easily, easy flow, easy to read and follow. So I do appreciate that. One comment in question, if we do come back, I would like consideration on, is under vacancies. Sometimes when we use words such as immediately, people, what immediately means to me, maybe different than how someone else interprets it, and may interpret that. It's just that, like an emergency meeting or so. And I like how you explained it during the presentation, but without Taylor and say all of us are gone in the next few years. I like how you added, and maybe if we could, in parentheses, put by the next meeting. If we do come back, because we have any other changes, I think that would be one that would be advantageous moving forward, just to have a little clarity on exactly what immediately means. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I think with that, \nSPEAKER_06:  that you're clarifying what we mean by immediately. That's something that we could strike today. I could, we could make an amended motion and come back. It's not, it's not such a departure from what's already in this document. It's like, you know what? Immediately is not clear. We talked about immediately, but if all the people in this room aren't here, it doesn't have to be a special meeting. So we could strike immediately and then change that at the next regular meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  for the next meeting of the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that would just add, I mean, and the other could please chime in, but I just think moving forward, when you use words like that, they can cause confusion and chaos sometimes. \nSPEAKER_06:  I try really hard not to, so I appreciate that. And keep that in mind. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you since we're on that question from a legal standpoint changing to next. Let's say we do it by the next meeting is there any ramifications we should consider? \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't think so. I think the ramifications is \nSPEAKER_06:  maybe in leaving it actually. I see what Dr. Batz is saying is that in leaving it, it's like we have to call an emergency meeting and special meeting because we're out of a chair. And it's like we don't have to do that, right? We just proceed really at the next meeting, take care of it. You should also have two officers. So the other officer should, I'm hoping that that's not a situation where you have two vacancies. You should have one person who's still an officer in theory. It's possible to have both officers leave. I hope that that doesn't happen. So there should be someone who can take the lead in the meantime. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  until we can have a new election for whatever the positions are going to be. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, thank you for clarifying good catch. Commissioner Betts. Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I just had one question and first I wanted to start with the same things. I know I'm one of those people that had a lot of questions last time. That you were probably pulling your hair out over. So this is an amazing document and I think this really will serve us well. So thank you really Taylor for the great work you did. The only question I had was on the ad hoc when we talked about the serving on one ad hoc committee. I'm just my only question is on that last part without first consulting city attorney's office. Is that subjective to whoever the city attorney is at the time? Because maybe in five years from now they say you can only do one and that maybe constricts us at all. Or is that kind of just a standing practice of how we would address that? \nSPEAKER_01:  plus one, plus two. \nSPEAKER_06:  So are you asking? \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Like if I stop being your attorney and you check with someone else or if Don stops being the city attorney \nSPEAKER_01:  I guess the neither situation. \nSPEAKER_06:  either situation. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number one, I would hope. \nSPEAKER_06:  that it's consistent. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think if... \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that's a case by case scenario. So if you're like, we have a plan, this is how we're gonna do ad hoc, we're looking to do this many ad hoc, here's how they're gonna be set up. This is what we're talking about for the different subject matters. There's no overlap, right? We can talk through how things are being set up to where it's like, \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, for the rest of this year, you can move forward with this plan. I don't see an issue of it. Or \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, I had another commission actually. \nSPEAKER_06:  is in a similar situation to you. \nSPEAKER_06:  We want more ad hoc, we don't want to be limited, and they actually had a different attorney start. \nSPEAKER_06:  as their attorney. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  and they came to the same conclusion you did. And so the advice that they're getting is the same. We should talk about what you're doing. You can do it. You can do more. But staff's capacity and our capacity to be there for you changes with how many bodies there are. As I said before, the responsibility for you to comply with the Brown Act is on you as individual commissioners. So I think it's, \nSPEAKER_06:  trying to think of a nice way to say this. Sometimes commissions do things with the best intent. \nSPEAKER_06:  And they travel down a path that puts them in a situation where the \nSPEAKER_06:  They either inadvertently violate the Brown Act or allegedly, right, or they put themselves in a position where the probability that something bad is going to happen is higher. And so just having a conversation about it that \nSPEAKER_06:  the path that we're traveling on. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm trying to think about it. \nSPEAKER_06:  My office has a different perspective than you do as individual commissioners about protecting the city from liability. So I think it's more of a check-in that like, hey, this is what we're doing. Do you see any problems with the way that we're going about this? \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think it can be for longer periods of time. It doesn't have to be every time you do something. Like if you have a bigger plan, you can talk through what that plan is. And I'm always happy to work, like as long as I'm your attorney, I'm always happy to work with you to find a way forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  Definitely not and I don't have any changes to it. I just wanted to clarify where clarity on that. So thank you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you Commissioner Allen Commissioner Cole. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, thank you. And thank you again for all the great work. This is a logistic question and it relates to quorum. \nSPEAKER_07:  but I didn't see it anywhere. \nSPEAKER_07:  Are we able as commissioners to join through \nSPEAKER_07:  So \nSPEAKER_07:  or whatever the technology is that we will be using. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hmm... So... Generally, no. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's a different \nSPEAKER_06:  My long know is because it's complicated. The Brown Act has actually three different sets of rules for joining virtually. The one that we had the benefit of most recently was COVID. In COVID, \nSPEAKER_06:  We were able to have completely remote meetings and the rules about how that went and we didn't have to be in person. And I think a lot of people got used to that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Those rules are gone right now. The only way that we get that back is if we are in a situation where there is a \nSPEAKER_06:  declared emergency by the governor of the state of California and either local or state health officials recommend social distancing. We're basically, it's probably another pandemic. The need to keep people separate to avoid contagious disease is probably high. So we hope that those rules don't activate. There is the traditional Brown Act rules, which means that the secondary location has to be open to the public. That means if you wanted to remote into your house, you'd have to make your house open to the public. And it has to be within the boundaries of the city of law. That's not true. \nSPEAKER_06:  At least one location has to be within the city, and a quorum of the body has to be present in the city and open and accessible to the public. So like, we've had council members go to Hawaii. \nSPEAKER_06:  and have part of the council meeting at a hotel on Maui. And we've had public comment from the mayor, you know, of that town. \nSPEAKER_06:  So that's an option. There is a third option that's just caused personal emergency. Those laws are a little bit more complicated. There are instances where you might be able to be remote. However, that is a lot easier said than done for. \nSPEAKER_06:  TID, our Technology Department to facilitate that, they need notice. It has to be possible to have the meeting in the chambers because this is the only building that can facilitate that type of meeting, a hybrid meeting at that time. And to be honest with you, the technology that we have to facilitate those meetings is not always reliable. \nSPEAKER_06:  So your ability to participate. \nSPEAKER_06:  May or may not be there. Where generally we recommend that if you need to be absent for a meeting, it's better to just be absent and to plan for it because it's such a heavy lift, especially for staff to facilitate that. And there's a bunch of legal hoops that we all have to jump through and you have to the commission has to justify it. You have to justify it. Staff has to notice the meeting in a certain way. It's a lot of work to facilitate that. So long answer is like. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's possible but not really. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for that answer. You're welcome. I didn't think- Teacher and ten years or so from now, that might be different, but right now it is what it is. \nSPEAKER_06:  you're well. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't think so. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  I know the legislature is looking at things like that, but right now. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's the very complex set of rules is what it is. So. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sounds like regardless of how many we may want to cut a fine by loss if at all it does it it's mood because we have a higher acting document that supersedes that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, so the hierarchy is... \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  State Federal or Constitution of the United States. Federal law, state law, long beach law, bylaws. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. So we have an active motion by Commissioner Schultz and Commissioner, and a second by Commissioner Camacho for the approval of the, the bylaws, however, I'm going to, I took notes. I'm going to synthesize the notes and make some recommendations for how we can maybe amend a little bit so we don't change conceptually what's documents we have. That's what I heard loud and clear. We're not going to make any changes. But I also want to be mindful of some recommendations that were made and respond those recommendations and how we can deal with them in the future. So regarding the question, recommendation on nominating the most senior member, maybe this particular body, if that were to occur in the future, in Mumbai, given our conversation, given the president, just being mindful of that precedent and deferring to that out of a cultural practice within the commission, can suffice for now. And then a year from now, maybe if this is needed as we revise or look at strengths of our bylaws and areas of improvement it need be, and I'm just saying a year it could be longer than a year. If that is necessary and other things are an essay, that can be changed then, in the spirit of trying to get this moving forward. Not that I don't want to see Taylor again next month, but I know she's a very, very busy woman, but I also want to be mindful of those scheduling considerations. So the other response, I think the community agreements really capture the sense of limiting, not limiting commissioner comments, we mean mindful of space and conversation. And something that I would remember as if I didn't mention, and it happens perhaps unintentionally, is sometimes the thigh-lifting impact of louder voices compared to other voices. So one thing that I'm practicing on as someone probably has allowed a voice from, for many years of teaching, is just being mindful of step in back and waiting for time. I'm sure you've seen me asking for comments or questions, and sometimes those moments of silence may feel awkward to some, but that's intentional on my end to make sure that I provide enough space and time for people to digest whatever comments want to make. I think the more that we practice that in concert with one another, that can help with the flow of conversations. And then finally, the recommendation that I believe we can make based on Taylor's response to Commissioner Dr. Bats is the change to the vacancies line and changing it from immediately to by the next meeting. In order for that to happen, I'm assuming the procedure is I would ask to give you a chance to give you a chance to give you a chance to give you a chance to give you a chance to give you a chance to give you a chance to \nSPEAKER_01:  I mean, yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  I know I should have given the other presentation first. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, that's my- \nSPEAKER_00:  So we'll make that that slight adjustment to the motion and Commissioner Kamachar, you okay with still seconding it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  So make that change and now we can move forward with the formal voting process in improving our by-laws. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Schultz. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Motion is carried. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to pause this. I mean, let's give everyone a round of applause. We have bylaws. And this is an incredible framework that we can now use to refer to and use to advance work. And speaking of advancement of work, we have this other presentation on Robert's rules of order that the more that we wrap our minds around how to move recommendations with his body, the better it is going to be for all of us."

So we'll turn again to Commissioner, we're getting a lot of of Taylor Anderson today because we won't see her probably for some time. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I know this feels like the Taylor show. It's not my dream. I prefer to listen to you doing your thing \nSPEAKER_07:  The \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a caveat with this presentation, and I was joking with commissioners before the meeting started. Robert's rule is very substantial in the amount of information and procedure that is in that document. \nSPEAKER_02:  with that being said a couple things. Number one. \nSPEAKER_02:  This presentation is not comprehensive. \nSPEAKER_02:  This presentation is about focusing on the things that you need to do to have efficient meetings and for your meetings to run smoothly. It covers motions. It does not cover the entire gamut of motions that are available to you. But I think that that's okay. And I spent a lot of time waking up in the middle of the night about this. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that what we're talking about here are the tools that you need to move forward. If you have a desire to get really formal and understand what those other motions are, \nSPEAKER_02:  I can provide you alternative resources. Happy to do that. I really don't think it's necessary for what you're doing here. I think this should be enough to help you. The other thing that I want to note is that some of the things in this presentation are not strictly Robert's rules. \nSPEAKER_02:  And the reason for that is that Long Beach has its own customs in the way that we do business. And it found that doing business is the most efficient. So if you see things in here and you're like, why was told it was something else? You probably were. And it probably is something different than Robert's rules. And that's OK. These rules aren't like the Brown Act. They can be amended by your bylaws. There is a hierarchy in structure, like I said, Constitution going down state, federal, all to local laws to these bylaws. My long-term dream for all of the bodies in the city is that we have a formal policy adopted. But there's only so many hours in the day, and I can't tackle that right now. So it's on my to-do list. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the dream is for all of you to do similar. So if you change commissions, it's not a huge culture shock. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this presentation is actually my first draft, and eventually this is going to turn into a presentation that's given to all the commissions. And it will be available online. I'd like to acknowledge that my office got a new logo. It's that little book on the pillar. Our focus is openness and transparency. Hashtag keeping illegal. And it's a collaboration with the City of Long Beach Office of Ethics and Transparency. \nSPEAKER_02:  So topics in this presentation, we've got a lot going on. I'm going to try real hard not to be boring. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we're going to cover why do you even need these rules? Basic principles, role of a chair, the goal of meeting discussions when you're here. How does this stuff actually work? The typical procedure for agenda item, like how that operates within the item itself. \nSPEAKER_02:  You getting to speak what happens when you're speaking? Motions, public comment, and discussion. \nSPEAKER_02:  as promised, this one has my bitmogee in it. \nSPEAKER_02:  The presentation that will be uploaded for all commissions will also have my bimboji. My colleague Monica Calita was kind enough to also lend me her likeness. She'll appear later in the presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  not her voice, just the likeness. To spice this up, I understand that this is... \nSPEAKER_02:  It's really legal stuff and it can be kind of boring. But it's super important. \nSPEAKER_02:  So why do we even need these rules? So... \nSPEAKER_02:  We need them to bring order to meetings and to keep them on track. \nSPEAKER_02:  It allows commissions to take care of business in an efficient and predictable manner. We know what to expect in every meeting and how the flow of the meeting will go. The more that we can sink into that idea, \nSPEAKER_02:  the more work that we can get done, which is we talked about that that's why we're here. \nSPEAKER_02:  These rules are actually common tested ways to conduct meetings. And the really old time, I'm not going to bore you with all those details, but these have been tested for a very long time. It gives everyone an opportunity to participate and we heard. That's the community agreement thing I was talking about. And if you use properly, this can actually avoid confusion. I know for you right now, I probably doesn't feel like that, but I promise you, if you buy into this idea, it will, we will get there. \nSPEAKER_02:  So basic principles, the chair runs the meeting consisting with the Brown Act, your bylaws, and Robert Thrull's of Order. Decisions are made by a majority vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  The commission should conduct its business orderly and efficiently. Every member in all viewpoints should have an equal opportunity to participate and be heard before voting. \nSPEAKER_02:  fairness and courtesy of the monica look at we're having a discussion the look at that decorum in our eyes \nSPEAKER_02:  Fairness and courtesy for all members, rules of procedure should be followed consistently and uniformly. These rules are intended to keep order and decorum during the meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And the rules are actually, I know sometimes it doesn't feel like this, it's supposed to help you, it's not supposed to prevent you from getting things done. \nSPEAKER_02:  So roll of the chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Introducing business and proper order per the agenda we talked about that in the last item getting through the agenda items in a timely manner The the chair is the really the time keeper and keeping the commission on task as we move things forward You only have what two and a half hours and you got a lot of work to do \nSPEAKER_02:  Determining if a motion is in order. Keeping the discussion focused on the agenda item, which is consistent with the Brown Act. We can't talk about things that aren't on the agenda. And \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, you can't talk about things that are really agenda. \nSPEAKER_02:  or not about things that \nSPEAKER_02:  aren't the agenda item that you're on in that moment. And then enforcing time limits fairly and neutrally for all public speakers. \nSPEAKER_02:  the goal of meeting discussions. \nSPEAKER_02:  Like what are we really trying to do here, right? In the discussions that you're having. \nSPEAKER_02:  You're trying to receive and share information so that everyone can make informed choices. We kind of talked about this with the community agreements. Maybe everyone's perspective isn't the same as yours. I know for sure that all of our life experiences are not the same. The same. This is a lot of talking. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so maybe other people have other pieces of information. Maybe staff has information. You know, this is an information exchange here so that you can come to a decision. We're looking to share thoughts and perspectives on what decision best serves the public's interest and other community values. Again, that's why we're here. We're serving the public. \nSPEAKER_02:  to reach a decision on what the best option is to reach decisions in a way that builds and maintains relationships between you as a body and as commissioners. Reaching decisions in a way that promotes the public's trust and both commissioners and the decision making process. This one comes to like \nSPEAKER_02:  If the public knows that you should be recusing on an item, because you work for a business that maybe \nSPEAKER_02:  You're making a decision about that business. I know that's not the type of work that you do. That's the most common kind of conflict that comes up. And you're voting anyway. It diminishes the public's trust in what we're doing here. And that's problematic. And they don't trust the decision-making of what you're doing. And \nSPEAKER_02:  There is a trickle down effect of the public not trusting us. We're here to serve the public. It's important for their voices to be heard. It's also important for them to understand that they can come to us as the government and share their voices. We're here to serve them their opinions if they don't provide their opinions because they don't trust us. How can we provide the services that we need to meet their needs? How can we respond to the things that the community wants if they don't trust us enough to tell us? Right? And you're part of building that public trust. No pressure. \nSPEAKER_02:  How does it work? I don't like that the bitmoji is cranky here. She should be more patient in the face, so I apologize. Because she should be patiently waiting her turn to speak, not, I think her little foot is wiggling. But so a quorum should be present to start the meeting and conduct business. This is consistent with the browning. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then you move, we've talked, this is the third time I'm mentioning it. Move down the agenda in order. It's a concept in Robert's rules. It's now in your bylaws and the Brown Act too. All agenda items require a motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  A second, a debate slash discussion, if it's needed, you know, like the minutes. Most of the time we don't need a big discussion on it, and then a vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  commissioners wait to speak until recognized by the chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the typical procedure for an agenda item is this. We've had a few conversations about when the motion happens. I've had robust discussions with my office about what that means. Because you were not the only commission when we started to have the conversation of like, let's shift to what you're supposed to be doing of having the motion at the top of the item. Well, sometimes you all don't know what you want to do yet. \nSPEAKER_02:  And how can you make a motion if you don't know what you want to do? And how can you make a motion if you really need to hear from the public first? So there's a couple scenarios that this can play out. Generally, this is what this supposed to look like. If we change the order of some of the parts, it's okay. You're not going to like brown act jail or Robert's rules jail if you do it. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's really what the needs of the body are and we can get into that a little bit more. So typically what happens is it's a presentation or staff report. And then if you need a short discussion to get to the point where you're like, okay, this is what we think we're going to do. Somebody's ready to make a motion now. That's okay. If before. \nSPEAKER_02:  If maybe you don't need a discussion yet, but... \nSPEAKER_02:  You want to hear from the public first. Sometimes that tends to happen a lot more when you know that the public feels very strongly and the items are more controversial with the public. And you've got an audience full of people here to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sometimes it's important to make sure that the public feels heard before you have a discussion, giving them the space. Sometimes it's a time constraint, right? Of like we need to make sure that we have plenty of time for the public to have their voices be heard. \nSPEAKER_02:  So it's really from an item to item standpoint of making that adjustment. \nSPEAKER_02:  And as long as you have public comment, and as long as we get to a motion and a decision, either good, bad, up or down, \nSPEAKER_02:  It's okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I don't want you to feel shame or that you're doing anything wrong in taking these things out of order from what's on the screen here. That's not the intent. Right. So, but generally getting in the habit of doing the same thing every time. So if your preference as a body is to hear public comment before you have the discussion. \nSPEAKER_02:  not changing it up every item if you don't have to, helps everybody anticipate the flow of what the item is going to be. So presentation staff report, if that's even needed, sometimes it's not. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner makes a motion. Another commissioner, different human being, seconds the motion. Take public comment. And I want to note here taking public comment before the discussion is important. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  And the reason for that is \nSPEAKER_02:  It usually triggers a second discussion. We can cover that a little bit more later, but... \nSPEAKER_02:  making sure that \nSPEAKER_02:  We're being efficient about the way that we're caring about it, as I'm talking for a very long time in this slide. The Chair then restates the motion after public comment to make sure that we all remember what we're about to talk about, what we're agreeing on. And then after the discussion, if there is any Chair puts motion to a vote and the Chair or staff can announce the outcome. \nSPEAKER_02:  getting to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  So you all have equal rights to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  only one commissioner should be speaking at a time. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then really when you have something to say you should ask for recognition by the chair. We're lucky here we're in the chambers we have the technology but this commission has also been in spaces where we do not have the technology. And it would. \nSPEAKER_02:  We got technology and then the technology wasn't helpful and it was very chaotic. So the plan B, if you don't have technology if it goes off the rails, is to raise your hand. And then, \nSPEAKER_02:  to be acknowledged once you're acknowledged by the chair then. \nSPEAKER_02:  You can speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then the chair shouldn't engage. We've talked about this with this commission a lot. I know it's important to you, but you shouldn't engage in debate with anyone providing public comment other than a brief response. That's because of the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_02:  We don't want you accidentally by talking about something that's not on the agenda. Something to note here is, I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had a script for this too, so I'm not sure if I included it on another side. But don't raise your hand to be acknowledged by the chair when someone else is speaking. It's kind of rude. It's the Taylor emoji where she's like, I'm waiting. Right? It sends energy that you're not being a good listener. You're not being respectful of the person that has the floor. So wait until whoever the speaker is speaking to finish before you ask, you know, to speak again. It's a little bit different when you have the technology and someone says something and you can go, \nSPEAKER_02:  and get put into the queue. This is more for when you physically have to demonstrate. \nSPEAKER_02:  Also, I'd like to note that Robert's rule says that you have to stand up to be an entrepreneur of the chair, which is like so awkward I can't even. So please raise your hand. You do not have to stand up. \nSPEAKER_02:  motions. So once you recognize by the chair, you can make a motion. Motion, all motions must be seconded by another member that we're going to talk about today. The motions debated voted on and then we talked about this a little bit earlier. Typical motions are main motion, second, friendly, amendment and substitute. \nSPEAKER_02:  How do you make a motion? Great question. Thank you for asking. So to make a motion you say I move that, insert the thing that you want to do. For my fun example, I move to recommend the city buys a new fire truck. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right? I tried to, I tried very hard just so you know to find a thing that's relevant to all the commissions and it was very hard because everything that you do is so different. So this is where we landed as fire trucks. \nSPEAKER_02:  the motion? What are we doing with the motion? \nSPEAKER_02:  The motion says, let's do this about that, right? And so we're introducing a new subject for discussion and action for everybody to talk about. You can withdraw motion or second at any time before it's adopted or rejected. So basically, anytime before the vote is called and be clear and specific. So a good motion \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want to emphasize this point. So being clear and specific is important for a few reasons. Number one, you want all of your fellow commissioners to know what we're all trying to accomplish here and what you're talking about. Number two, we want the public to understand what they're providing feedback on when they provide you public comment and what you're considering adapting as a recommendation. And number three, our favorite person in the room, Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't know if you've ever watched the clerk's face at a council meeting or during a commission meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  When a commissioner or a council member includes feelings and the motion, their eyes get the size of dish plates because they panic and they do this laser thing across the room to the city attorney's office and it's like help. Because what that help signal is, is that they're trying to figure out what the motion is because they have to capture it for the minutes. And the minutes is the thing that everybody relies on for what happened. So if you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So for example, I move to recommend the city by the new fire track. That's great. Madam Clerk will be so excited about that. If you do this, she's going to give me giant eyes from across the room. \nSPEAKER_02:  I move that we recommend city buys a new fire truck because isn't the fire department so great. I went to an event with the chief and I just it's so important that we support the firefighters and the work that they're doing and that they have the ability to respond to the community and you know I just I saw one of them save a cat from a tree the other day and it was just so cool and then do you know that they have the jaws of life and it doesn't always go like that but there's all this extra information that gets weaved in that doesn't need to be there. \nSPEAKER_02:  I am not telling you that you cannot have great feelings about the motion that you are making or the fire department. What I am saying to you is keep your feelings and your sentiments about why you think the motion is important, why you think that the commission should buy into what you're doing and what you're proposing. \nSPEAKER_02:  separate. \nSPEAKER_02:  I move to recommend the city buys a new fire track. \nSPEAKER_02:  dramatic pause. You don't have to dramatic pause but a break in space so that the clerk knows that you're done. \nSPEAKER_02:  I really think that it's important for the body to recognize that we need fire trucks. The data that I saw is the response times are down. \nSPEAKER_02:  because we don't have enough engines. And you can get into the other part. Or you can start with all that stuff. \nSPEAKER_02:  That information is great. It helps everybody by like realize and recognize why you're trying to make the motion and what you're trying to accomplish. Just keep it separate so you don't break Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and then sometimes too, it'll happen like \nSPEAKER_02:  when I first started. \nSPEAKER_02:  It would be like, we don't know what happened last night at council. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I was like, what do you mean? And then... \nSPEAKER_02:  Like there's been a few times where we have to watch the tape back. I'm not joking like ten times to figure out to help the clerk write the and not just counsel for commissions too. But nobody has clean hands here, right? So. \nSPEAKER_02:  But like everybody should understand what it shouldn't come to that. Everybody should understand what we're trying to do here. OK? \nSPEAKER_02:  How to second emotion, this one's so easy. \nSPEAKER_02:  May motions have to have a second. \nSPEAKER_02:  Second emotion, you say I second the motion. Done. \nSPEAKER_02:  So you can withdraw any time before the motion is adopted or rejected. Ooh, rejected. No second, no discussion. \nSPEAKER_02:  You have to have a second to have a discussion. Second does not mean that you're gonna vote yes. It doesn't mean that you agree with the item. What it means is that you think that whatever the motion is is worth discussing and that the body should discuss it. \nSPEAKER_02:  if there is no second it dies. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  and then something to note here, it can be awkward. \nSPEAKER_02:  It can be awkward that nobody supports your idea. \nSPEAKER_02:  I hope as commissioners that we have thick skin and acknowledge that's okay. The chair is going to be super polite and move on because the beat has to go on. The item has to go on. We have to come up with other ideas right to resolve this. So don't have hard feelings if you can't get a second for your motion. And sometimes \nSPEAKER_02:  what we need. \nSPEAKER_02:  is a friendly moment. \nSPEAKER_02:  So friendly amendments is this is a very long beachy thing. \nSPEAKER_02:  In Roberts' rules, there really amended motions. We colloquially refer to them as friendlies. And the rules here is really a practice of long beach of how we do things. So they're used whenever you want to change the wording of a motion under consideration. They can make a great idea better, and they can make a bad idea more palatable to the body, right? So it must be relevant to the main motions. So if we're saying that we want to buy fire trucks. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're not talking about planting trees in the park. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right? So... \nSPEAKER_02:  And it depends to, this one's a little bit more complicated, but it depends on what the agenda item is, on what the scope of the things that you can talk about is. Right, and what you can add to the motion. My example here is actually going to be pretty broad. I think it was like a budgetary thing. So a friendly amendment, we're adding or striking words in the main motion typically. \nSPEAKER_02:  If the maker of the motion agrees to the change, the motion is amended. We had a little sample of that on the last agenda item. So something that our current city attorney noted as a practice is the change, the seconder can object to the change, they don't have to agree. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  If you're the seconder, speak up if you don't agree with what the change is. \nSPEAKER_02:  to how do you make a friendly amendment? \nSPEAKER_02:  To request a friendly amendment, you'd say, would the maker of the motion be open to and insert the changes that you're looking for? You don't have to use those magic words exactly, but basically a polite request. \nSPEAKER_02:  to the maker of the motion if they're open to the change. So I think the branding of the city should be reflected in the fire trucks with the maker of the motion be open to including that the fire trucks should be blue. \nSPEAKER_02:  Wouldn't that be something? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I have to amuse myself. \nSPEAKER_02:  Like it's hard for me to come up with ways to make this entertaining for you to okay so this is \nSPEAKER_02:  Substitute motions. So friendly motions as we're still talking about the main motion and there's so there's a motion and a second Substitute is we were going straight now. We're going left \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a completely different direction than what the original motion was. \nSPEAKER_02:  They have to be substantively different from the main motion. The new motion, proposing a different action, than the main motion is before the body. You can only discuss one motion at a time. So the minute that someone makes a substitute motion and it gets a second, we're done talking about whether the fire truck should be blue or not. We're talking about the new thing that's on the floor. \nSPEAKER_02:  Monica said that my bitmoji was inappropriate here, so I probably have to change that. But I told her she's, we're making a substitute motion. We don't agree with the underlying motion and she's my involuntary second. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's why she's like, oh, here we go. She knows what she got into. \nSPEAKER_02:  So to make a substitute motion same language, I move that. Usually substitute motions are professed by, you know, respectfully I disagree. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that we should do something different. It's usually followed by... \nSPEAKER_02:  time set a friendly amendment that don't get traction. It doesn't always have to be that way. But usually there's a little bit more back and forth before we get to substitute. Substitutes like rock paper scissors. You're saying I completely disagree with what's happening here, and we need to do something different. And sometimes that happens, and it's OK. It's OK. As long as you talk to each other with respect, and treat each other with respect in these exchanges, it's OK to have a difference of opinion on what you're doing and to feel strongly about it. So our main motion with a friendly is I move that the commission recommends the city buys a new blue fire track. \nSPEAKER_02:  A substitute motion, I move the commission recommends the city buys a new mobile adoption trailer for the animal shelter. Right, it's a way to spend money but it's completely different. \nSPEAKER_02:  it gets more complicated. So you can have a substitute motion, which same concept. You can only have three motions on the floor at a time. I think we'll talk about that on the next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  All three of the motions have to be different. \nSPEAKER_02:  So for a substitute, substitute motion, I move the commission recommends the city paves alleyways with the extra funds. It's completely different than the other things that we're talking about, right? And it's assuming, too, that we can't get an agreement for the maker of the motion, that we split the funds three ways between these ideas, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  So how to manage multiple motions, I hope for all of you that this never happens to this body. It is extremely, from like a nerdy legal standpoint, you're like, oh my gosh, this is like things are happening. But from a commission standpoint, when this is happening, it's very stressful. \nSPEAKER_02:  It usually means that there's a disagreement with the body and it usually means that you can't come to consensus on what you're doing. \nSPEAKER_02:  So... \nSPEAKER_02:  Substitute motions are really a last resort when we're not finding. \nSPEAKER_02:  consensus. \nSPEAKER_02:  The way it works is you vote the last motion first and you work your way backwards. If the motion, if any of the motions are successful, you're done. \nSPEAKER_02:  If one of the motions fails, so if the substitute fails, then you move on to the substitute. And if that one fails, then we go back to the main motion and you hope that that one works out. And if not, we go back to the drawing board. So only the motion on the floor can be discussed. So if we're, we've got a substitute substitute, we're talking about paving alleyways and whether or not that's appropriate for the city to spend the money and the commission to make that recommendation. \nSPEAKER_02:  No more than three motion can be proposed at a time. Thank goodness, because that is a lot to keep track of. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is my fun arrow to show you. So these are the motions that were made in order, 1, 2, 3. We have the blue fire truck, the adoption trailer, and then paving the alleyways. You consider them in reverse. Arrow goes up. Before I move on from this, anybody have any questions? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, Mr. Collegiate. Do they all have to be moved and excited by different commissioners? Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. Well, so. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, so if you're on a commission of five year tough, you better find consensus. So it has to be all different people because otherwise we're talking about friendlies, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  and uh \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, it's six different people. So you better hope. I mean, you have a lot of people despair, but I hope that you find consensus faster than that. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think I have almost half the commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  This bitmoji mimila is required by the Brown Act. Public comment may occur either after the presentation or staff report or after motion and second but before the discussion. We talked about this. Don't do it after the discussion. Number one. \nSPEAKER_02:  You'll probably end up with a second discussion if the public provided something of value. Number two, it hurts the public's feelings and we care a lot about them and we don't want their feelings to be hurt. We want their voices to be heard. That's why we're doing these meetings out in the public in the sunshine is so that they can participate. So \nSPEAKER_02:  They are \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't want to say honorary commissioner, but they're part of this experience and you should honor that part. \nSPEAKER_02:  You are here for you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, so after... \nSPEAKER_02:  So after public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  The chair will open motion for discussion assuming the order of it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  agenda. It's typically going. \nSPEAKER_02:  So after a motion has been seconded, you can discuss or comment on the motion on the floor. Priority needs to be given to commissioners who haven't spoken yet over those who wish to speak again. That's also in your community agreements. When there are no more commissioners that wish to discuss or comment further, the chair will call for a vote on the motion. The chair also, no pressure, but. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a feeling too of that the discussion maybe is getting to the point where we're talking about the same things and We're not really getting any traction where the commission really needs to take a vote to \nSPEAKER_02:  to come to a consensus. I don't know how else to describe that. Well, like, \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't know if you are in the habit of watching council meetings. Sometimes the mayor will do that where the discussion kind of gets that. He says, you know what? Let's call for a vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  and see where everybody stands on this. And then after that, you can take. \nSPEAKER_02:  You can make a new motion, you can make an adjustment, the item fails, we move on to the next agenda item, whatever it is. Yes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Anybody, any commissioner can also call for a vote. Is that right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Roll of the chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a big responsibility. This is actually split up into two slides. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in the last presentation, the responsibilities that were reflected are different than the ones here. When I was like, oh wait. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, running an orderly meeting, what does that mean? Here is what we're talking about. So ensuring clear decisions are made, recognizing the commissioners that wish to speak, ensuring debate is controlled to ensure fairness, balance and efficiency, ensuring every member and all viewpoints have an equal opportunity to participate and be heard. \nSPEAKER_02:  active listening to determine potential points of agreement and testing those points for actual agreement. \nSPEAKER_02:  The \nSPEAKER_02:  chair and then managing conflicts that arise during discussion. The chair has a lot of hats. Sometimes the chair is a referee. Sometimes the chair is a mediator. The consensus builder. There's a lot that goes on in being a chair into helping facilitate running the meeting efficiently and making sure that, especially in a commission of this size, that \nSPEAKER_02:  everyone is being treated with respect and decorum, the acknowledging, you know, \nSPEAKER_02:  I talked about it, I think earlier. I think there's some commissioners, I'm not sure if I've ever heard them speak or they've spoken like a few times, right? Acknowledging. \nSPEAKER_02:  and giving space to those commissioners, they may not feel the way the discussion is going that they're space for them to speak, right? So creating those opportunities too. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair calls for the vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  button so big. \nSPEAKER_02:  up. \nSPEAKER_02:  It seems smaller on my computer. So the chair must call for the vote. Secret ballots are prohibited under the Brown Act. So Secret ballots and Roberts rules are allowed. But because we do things open, public, and transparent, they are not allowed. The great majority of commissions don't have the ability to go into closed session. That would be the time that vote is not allowed, or is allowed outside of the view of the public. \nSPEAKER_02:  The exceptions are really, really strict. I looked at them again just in case there's probably not a reason that you're going to be able to go into closed session just because of the nature. The bar to get into closed session is very high. \nSPEAKER_02:  So if the vote is a tie, this is actually in your bylaws, the motion fails, ties in our majority. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's it. That's the whole thing. We made it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yay! So... \nSPEAKER_02:  Do you have... \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm available for questions. I know that was a lot to digest. \nSPEAKER_07:  Before we take on questions in the spirit of what you've just shared, we need a motion to receive a file second and then we'll move to public comment. So can I get a motion to Commissioner Schultz? He makes the motion seconded by Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_07:  Can I have the clerk, Madam Clerk, please call for public comment. \nSPEAKER_08:  If there are any members in the public that would like to speak here in person, please line up at the podium at this time. \nSPEAKER_08:  Seeing none in person, if there are any members of the public in the Zoom now would like to speak on item three, please use the raised hand feature now. \nSPEAKER_08:  We have one in the Zoom. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_08:  Hello, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Good evening commissioners. My name is Dave Schupler. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  that I would just... \nSPEAKER_06:  like to commend you for going through all. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_06:  this is in depth and a partation. \nSPEAKER_06:  As you may know, I'm someone who speaks somewhat frequently at City meetings and \nSPEAKER_06:  As a member of the public, I strongly agree that public comment should be taken before. \nSPEAKER_06:  or council of the court. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner of discussion. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  I think it isn't just a respect for public issues, it also makes the informational issue. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, ok one more thing to cross. \nSPEAKER_06:  You heard a lot about good process, good decision making process. \nSPEAKER_06:  when it comes to your motions but \nSPEAKER_06:  part of that. \nSPEAKER_06:  in a democratic society is also being informed by the public. \nSPEAKER_06:  and thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  or \nSPEAKER_06:  for acknowledging that and for trying to make that more of a \nSPEAKER_06:  practice, not just in this commission, but hopefully in other meetings as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  That concludes the comment for this item. \nSPEAKER_07:  appreciate the comment Dave Schuchler in uplifting the value of public comment. I now turn to fellow commissioners if there are any comments on the presentation. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner I turn around as probably instead of using the screen but Commissioner bats \nSPEAKER_03:  Taylor again, I just want to say thank you for that and I am wondering are you \nSPEAKER_03:  Is this on Tony R.P.? \nSPEAKER_07:  is \nSPEAKER_03:  And if not, are you willing to share this? Because I think this is some valuable per... \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you clarify what you're asking? \nSPEAKER_03:  your presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, yes, it's on LegislStar. You should have received a copy of a via email today. And I apologize. I... \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  in talking about capacity. I literally have been up since like 5 o'clock this morning trying to finish this presentation. It turned out to be a lot more difficult than I anticipated, so I got it to staff at the 11th hour. So you should have a copy of it. If not, we can make sure that one is sent to you. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's fine, I haven't had time to check in with you today. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, no, it's okay. It's my fault. Gabe was literally sent up 430, I think. Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Ho. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes, and following with your example of the truck, the \nSPEAKER_10:  a new fire truck, what if we don't have all the details? Or how much does that cost? Well, it could be between 50 or 100 grams. \nSPEAKER_10:  How do we table it? \nSPEAKER_10:  and then request someone to go back and get the research and then make it on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_10:  for the next. \nSPEAKER_10:  Nearing. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think what would be different is that the motion changes. It's the motion in that case is motion to request staff to report back with XYZ, LMNOP. Whatever the information is is that you need to make a decision. It's okay. Well, hopefully that doesn't happen, but if it does happen, that's okay. You just need to change course. So a lot of times, \nSPEAKER_02:  The motion is derived from the recommendation on the agenda, but it doesn't always have to be. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right, so you can pivot, right? You're like, we don't have enough information, or request, report back, or we, you know what? We're gonna refer this to an ad hoc committee to make a recommendation to the body before we make a final decision. Those options are okay too. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Guti\u00e9rrez. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. I just wanted to thank Taylor for all of her amazing work and getting us the support, the infrastructure that we needed. I have been on this commission. I was just looking at the date and I was like, wow, I was appointed five years ago. So I've been on this commission for just about five years and this is, you know, just in the last several months, we've really been laying the foundation for like the procedures and just the way that we operate more effectively. So just deeply appreciating that and yeah, we don't have to just like figure it out anymore. We have a true roadmap. So just filled with gratitude. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Gamerciuteta, as Commissioner Schultz. \nSPEAKER_01:  Another comment for Taylor, I said this off mic and I want to say this on the record. I feel that we're a, well, I'll speak for myself. I feel like I'm a smarter commissioner and a more informed commissioner. I thought I knew a lot about the Roberts rules. \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh uh \nSPEAKER_01:  but \nSPEAKER_01:  I've learned a lot more and I just really appreciate you like I said. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know where you came from, you just appeared. \nSPEAKER_06:  I got all the staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  and all the staff here and the time you spent, I just hope you know that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't want to speak for everybody, but I do want to say we really value you being here. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Do you guys agree? I'm gonna go. Yep. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't want to cry in a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  We talked about this earlier. \nSPEAKER_02:  We talked about this earlier. I'm just going to respond. I care about you a lot. And even though I'm not going to be here, I am invested. And I think that the work that you're doing isn't important. And I'm going to stop talking now because there's somebody shopping onions. \nSPEAKER_02:  But I hope that, and I know that attorneys don't say things like that to their clients, but I do care about you. And I think I've been in the trenches. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know. \nSPEAKER_02:  with you for \nSPEAKER_02:  behind the scenes for a while. So I just hope that you keep doing what you're set out to do. \nSPEAKER_07:  You're passing that on in around. If you feel it, Commissioner Gillette. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, as an attorney myself who represents public entities, I know how difficult this advising is and the job that you do and trying to explain something that it's rather dry to make it entertaining. I have a good, such an amazing job. So thank you, hats off to you. You're an amazing advisor to our commission. So, \nSPEAKER_00:  Great job and we'll miss you sitting there. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Taylor, I think you were a teacher in a former lifetime because you have found a way to make things that are very entertaining or a stand-up comp with comedian. I don't know, either of those work. So I echo my own commentators, a lot of gratitude that we have. Solid not just one frame, we're multiple frameworks tonight. And as folks have mentioned, this is going to make our work smoother, easier, hopefully, and advance the work of equity in the city of Long Beach. At this point, let's move forward with the vote. So I'm going to have Madam Clark here up the vote. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_08:  Motion is carried. \nSPEAKER_07:  I want to be mindful here it is 8.30. There are three agenda items left. I will work with Vice Chair Covington and staff to move these to the items. But I also want to say thank you to staff who have prepared regular sleep for those presentations. It's the nature of how sometimes flow. We're trying to be ambitious and squeeze as much as we can. But maybe this is a moment for us to reflect and see how many we can do, especially with limited time frame. But so thank you to staff. We'll move them to the other, because I don't want to ask commissioners to stay longer than we agreed to. But in respecting the agenda, any commissioners? Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  If I may, you started a half an hour late, so if everybody's okay with it, you could continue for another 30 minutes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for sharing. Yes. So how do we not just open it up or discussion first, before we move forward? I think. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think if you want to take the temperature of the commission if they want to continue I know it is late at night, but you're actually your bylaws say that you're meetings typically go for two and a half hours But if you want to end here and lay these items over you can take that opportunity to \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm fine person, but I think that's as a body, we've got to move kind of wherever at. So I want to let's take the temperature check. How are we on time? And just, you know, \nSPEAKER_07:  Can we, I mean, why don't we just go to the run now? We, I mean, let's figure this out. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, no. \nSPEAKER_07:  No, come over now. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, I think so. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. Okay. That's what I'm hearing. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_07:  MBC \ub274\uc2a4 \uae40\ud61c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm totally fine with us ending that. Can we just make sure that these items go first next month? Because I know we've laid these over a couple times. So if we can maybe just ensure that these are the first things we take up, regardless of what else comes up agenda-wise, I think that would be also good for the items as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, and that note because there was a member of the public who was, and others that expected an update on that. So I will uplift that, you know, in concert with the vice chair and discussion. So thank you. All right. And Commissioner with Dennis. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, I was just gonna propose if we could. \nSPEAKER_09:  Commissioner Allen, I have an update that would take like two minutes and that would actually satisfy one of the items, the update on the ad hoc. We could get that done very quickly, but I understand if you want to table to the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm fine if it's two minutes we're good with two minutes we're good two minute presentation and then maybe we can talk about How we can navigate that and that next member longer discussion, so please commissioner with"

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So let's call a man clerk can you call for the item for number four? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, item number four is a recommendation to receive and file a report from current ad hoc committees discussed and anticipated ad hoc committees for upcoming projects and if appropriate, take action to dissolve or create ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can I start, check? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you. So the ad hoc on recidivism did meet last Thursday. That includes Commissioner Allen and I. And of course, Tony as our support. So we met last Thursday at a meeting at Ronnie's House, which included community member Shereem, ED of Ronnie's House, as well as many other community members who Ronnie's House brought together the HRC ad hoc. And then these Justice Impacted Community Members who are recently reintegrating back into society after being incarcerated. In our meeting, we started by outlining all of the different components and elements of the conditions that would contribute to successful reentry for these community members. And then also discussed factors that contribute to recidivism. So those topics included employment, income, housing, entrepreneurship, and mental health. Many of these items were very similar to the presentation that we all received in May. I think there was just a few other details. We got to go deeper on each of these items. So a little more detail than we all received in May. But it was really just a deeper dive into some of these issues. \nSPEAKER_06:  particularly around employment. And so in that meeting, we decided that all of these topics were a lot, right? It's a lot to try to tackle employment and housing and entrepreneurship, mental health, all these different barriers. So we've decided that we really want to begin with employment and how that changes the scope of the ad hoc all turnover to Commissioner Allen in just one second, but to finish my update. We decided we want to really focus on employment as kind of the first business for this ad hoc, which will also include, like, \nSPEAKER_06:  Guaranteed basic income, which is also a little different than employment, but it's kind of an encompass in like income and employment. At that meeting we heard from representatives from Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network, or Workforce, but it's a PG-WIN, and they were there to really just answer some questions that community members had, that we had as we were doing some fact finding. And was that that's the Workforce Investment Network, that's what that is. So that was really, really helpful to have an expert in the room that is involved in the implementation on the city side around employment related initiatives. And then finally, after hearing all of those different topics, getting a deep dive around employment, like I said, we have decided that we want to focus in on employment, and we've decided that we want to change the scope of the ad hoc in order to actually adhere to the ad hoc rules and regulations. So I'll go ahead and turn it over to Commissioner Allen to just give a quick update on those changes that we're recommending. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, thank you, Commissioner, for the others. Not much more to add other than that, knowing that, and especially as we heard the kind of the conversation we were having in our subcommittee meeting, or the ad hoc committee meeting, that the issue of recidivism and reentry is quite large and they're even within the group. They had a five-page document of all the things they wanted to talk about. So we really recognize that in order to adhere to our bylaws and the intent of what we were going for, we wanted to limit the initial scope of this ad hoc committee to focus on the employment piece of recidivism and reentry, because that seemed to be the most pressing, that seemed to be the most challenging, and to the point that Commissioner Coutier has made about guaranteed income, one of the conversations around employment was that as folks are coming out of prison, having a little buffer of time, because they come out of prison with about $200 in their pockets and no skills at, other than what they know from prison, to be able to have a little bit of a cushion was something that they recommended as a lofty idea that we could look at around employment, to give them a buffer to gain some job related skills. And so it was one part of the conversation piece, but this initial ad hoc committee would just focus on that employment piece, so that it is more narrow in scope, and a little more manageable for us to accomplish in a couple months. \nSPEAKER_06:  And can I add one more thing? So the recommendation is to just to make it clear for city attorney and the clerk to focus this ad hoc like commercial and so specifically on employment. And then if there are, well, there will be, you know, we're imagining in the future, some of those other items that include housing and mental health and entrepreneurship that relate to recidivism, those will, we're recommending are to be tackled by \nSPEAKER_06:  additional ad hoc. So let's say we finished the employment, we'll then you know submit to you all our recommendations, absolve that ad hoc and then recommend to create a new ad hoc around those you know additional topics. \nSPEAKER_02:  Taylor. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm going to try and repeat this back to make sure that we have the motion clear. So then the motion on the floor would be to narrow the scope of the current reentry ad hog to employment considerations only. \nSPEAKER_05:  and all other \nSPEAKER_05:  Matters related to recidivism should be handled by \nSPEAKER_05:  different ad hoc to be formed at a later date. \nSPEAKER_06:  And sorry, can I just make one slide in the moment, employment slash career development? That's what would encompass the... \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  basic guaranteed income. \nSPEAKER_06:  Because the whole premise for that is that they get to focus on a career pathway. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so then the reentry ad hoc is going to be limited to employment slash career development. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then \nSPEAKER_05:  All other matters relating to reentry should be handled by additional adhocs to be formed at a later date. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that's Commissioner Gutierrez's motion, Commissioner Allen, I'm assuming you might second that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh yeah, I pushed the button for the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  No pressure. I'm sorry. I pushed them by the motion. I can't move anything. So I'll have to move around. Commissioner Allen can make them push in there. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  But there's no second. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So right now, it's like... \nSPEAKER_06:  So I'm running out. I'll see you next time on the news. I second. \nSPEAKER_02:  I have Commissioner Allen as the motion and second by Commissioner Gutiambus. That's what I have on record that work. That work, okay. So, Madam Clerk, can you call the vote? \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, come on. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm going to come in. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing no public comment here in person in the zoom if you would like to provide public comment on item number four Please use the raise hand feature now \nSPEAKER_04:  We have two in the zoom. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sherin, your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_00:  just wanted to just add quickly because entrepreneurial shift is. \nSPEAKER_00:  such a large part of it. I'm assuming it might be made. \nSPEAKER_00:  where it can come in, where it says career, but if we could include that, I don't know if it's too late or not, that would really be substantial. \nSPEAKER_02:  The request was to that career, which is the motion. That's what I heard. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  entrepreneurship. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and we can just take we can bring that up as an agenda item. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, next up we have \nSPEAKER_04:  Dave? \nSPEAKER_04:  Your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hello again can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, great. Thank you. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it's great. \nSPEAKER_03:  public area. \nSPEAKER_03:  and hopefully something that would be \nSPEAKER_03:  to be more institutionalized by the City of Long Beach, but for your commission, a great \nSPEAKER_03:  ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_03:  topic area. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  would be implementing. \nSPEAKER_03:  the city's climate plan in an equitable way. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I should say now that I say this. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Not only \nSPEAKER_03:  as someone who... \nSPEAKER_03:  advocated for the climate plans passage was sad to see what the city staff did with it. \nSPEAKER_03:  with very little public participation. \nSPEAKER_03:  but also someone who... \nSPEAKER_03:  after being frustrated by how little this city is doing. Give it a big hand. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's great historical responsibility. \nSPEAKER_02:  Ourma pipe topic. \nSPEAKER_03:  but specifically, I've left the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  So Mr Schulta. \nSPEAKER_03:  to help the city of Oakland. \nSPEAKER_03:  implement its climate plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mr. Schuchler. And the one you're talking about is outside the scope of this commission. So it would have to relate to equity and human relations in order \nSPEAKER_03:  as an ad hoc committee again. \nSPEAKER_05:  for your public comment. Again, that's someone who has \nSPEAKER_03:  Again, as someone who was who was participated in the the \nSPEAKER_03:  Formation of the Office of Equity and the Framework for Racial Repinciliation. \nSPEAKER_03:  what the city does with its climate climate. And the fact that there's a city that I'm literally working for the city of Oakland. \nSPEAKER_03:  that is. \nSPEAKER_03:  not only calling their climate plan the equitable climate plan, but a centered equity throughout all of the actions for implementing the climate plan is something that this commission should as well as the office of the equity should really take seriously as something that is in its scope and in its its purview. \nSPEAKER_05:  But it's... \nSPEAKER_00:  and in this. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city sells oil to paper cops and firefighters. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's an equitable over time. \nSPEAKER_03:  and it's inequitable right now that the children of those very workers. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're talking about ad hocs, Mr. Schuchler. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure, I don't know how much, you know, I didn't get a chance to do public comment, but again, this is something where \nSPEAKER_03:  What you do with your commission is up to your commission and what ad hoc \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just going to inject here. It's it's because of the birth and that we have to. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  are worried. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And what this, what I think to attend to. If it's the wrong space where I apologize, but. \nSPEAKER_02:  So what I think will be, you know, give it a go. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, equity as something and your commission is as people who have a role in what actually happens with the climate plan really does matter the city of London. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, thanks. That is all of public comment. And now we can move forward with the vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_04:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay."
