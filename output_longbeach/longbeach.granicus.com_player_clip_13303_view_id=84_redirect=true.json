        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  Motion passes. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, next item, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  Recommendation to receive and file an overview on the use of measure A in the proposed fiscal year 23 budget, including infrastructure project updates. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great, I'll turn it over to staff for a report. \nSPEAKER_04:  And usually... \nSPEAKER_11:  Great. \nSPEAKER_11:  chair Austin and members of the committee we have Nader Camoush our budget management officer who will kick off this presentation. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_06:  Great, thank you Grace. Good afternoon Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. This presentation will provide an overview of measure uses in the FY23 proposed budget. Also as part of this presentation, we'll have Director of Public Works Eric Lopez here to provide an update on infrastructure projects funded by Measure A. \nSPEAKER_06:  Since 2017, revenues generated for Mejore has been instrumental to maintaining the health and safety of the community through maintenance and restoration of police and fire services, and also providing funding for many other priority needs such as infrastructure investments, homeless outreach, mobility projects such as alle, streets, curb ramps, sidewalks, bike lanes. It has also helped fund parks in library improvements, restorations for city-owned facilities, and support for the community hospital. Mejore has truly been a vital funding source for the city along Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  To give a little context of measure A in FY23, in March 2020, voters approved to keep the 1% tax in place, which eliminated the 10-year sunset of measure A. This means the 1% will stay in effect unless voters decide to end it through another election. \nSPEAKER_06:  The new revenue from the extension does not begin to be realized until January 2023. \nSPEAKER_06:  Although the 10-year sunset was eliminating, started in January 1st, 2023, Mejory will drop from 1% to 3-quarters of her percent. \nSPEAKER_06:  This is in order to stay within the tax limit due to county measure age for homeless initiatives, which was approved prior to the 2020 voter change for measure A in Levy's quarter percent rate. \nSPEAKER_06:  Measure A will return to the full 1% rate in 2028 when county measure H sunsets. I do want to note while the tax rate is dropping to 3.4% from what it is today, it is still more than what was previously anticipated prior to the March 2020 vote, which would have decreased measure A down to 1.5% in 2023. \nSPEAKER_06:  In FY 23, Measuring Revenues are projected to generate approximately 67.4 million. The projection is inclusive of the tax dropping to three quarters of a percent starting in January 2023, due to the county measure age. For the sake of comparison, if we were to project the FY 23 Measuring Revenue at the full 1% in FY 23, it would be about 83 million, which is approximately 1.5% increase over the latest FY 22 projections. \nSPEAKER_06:  As mentioned in last week's Budget Oversight Committee, the strong revenue projections are due to the trends continuing to improve across various categories such as restaurants, hotels, and general consumer goods. \nSPEAKER_06:  In addition to the anticipated revenues, the FY23 budget plan for measure A is supported by 17.7 million from a planned release of cash that was set aside from previous years, and also includes 7.5 million from projected 12.8 million FY22 operating surplus. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uses a measuring FY 23's budget, totaling 92.7 million, which includes 93.8 million of structural uses and 52.9 million and one-time uses for public safety infrastructure projects and support for the community hospital. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the next few slides will go over these uses in more details. \nSPEAKER_06:  Since 2017, the revenues generated from measure A have allowed the city to maintain and restore public safety services. And the equivalent of 143 sworn positions have been maintained that may have otherwise been needed to be reduced. In FY23, a total of 2.9 million of additional public safety support was added to the budget to cover the cost for a 1.9 million budget issue related to the Fire Department's FY2020 budget reduction target. \nSPEAKER_06:  and 1.1 million to support the police departments increasing costs to doing business for some unfunded costs such as the library, I'm sorry, the crime lease and other expenses. \nSPEAKER_06:  In FY 23, a total of 29.4 million is planned to continue to maintain public safety services. \nSPEAKER_06:  In addition to maintaining public safety services, Mejury has allowed the city to restore and enhance services, including reestablishing the police self-stovision, restoring Fire Engine 8, supporting police academy staffing, and two quality of life officers. \nSPEAKER_06:  Also, since FY20 Measuring is supported engine 17 using one-time funds, \nSPEAKER_06:  This year, the city has submitted an application for the SAFE grant, which would help engine 17 remain in operations for at least three more years, assuming the grant requirements are met throughout the award period and including the requirement to maintain staffing at a certain level. \nSPEAKER_06:  In FY23, 612 to 610,000 of the Mejore funding is proposed structurally to cover the funding gap required to fully fund engine 17 operations with the Saferger. \nSPEAKER_06:  Also in previous years 2.2 million supported the police neighborhood safe streets program on a one time basis. \nSPEAKER_06:  The proposed FY23 budget will now utilize 2.2 million as a structural support for the new strategic outreach and prevention detail, the Stop Detail, which adds new police officers to expand the neighborhood walks concept to crime reduction through increased outreach and community engagement. Measure A will structurally fund 2.2 million for the Stop Detail, the equivalent of 11 police officers. \nSPEAKER_06:  In total, FY 23 has 9.5 million of measure funding to support public safety restorations and enhancements, which includes 50 public safety positions. \nSPEAKER_06:  The proposed FY23 budget also includes 5.4 million one times fundings for public safety programs, including 2.1 million for a two year outreach and cleanup initiative along the LA River beds. \nSPEAKER_06:  an additional 350,000 for the acquisition of vehicles to support that two-year cleanup program. \nSPEAKER_06:  1 million to support the coordinated response team that is working to reduce the overall violent crime citywide with an emphasis on gun control crimes. And lastly 1.3 million has been set aside for a debt service payment related to the 2018 purchase of Motorola Public Safety Radios. \nSPEAKER_06:  The proposed FY23 budget also includes a total of 12.5 million in measuring one times to support public safety health and other critical needs. This includes 1 million to support the community hospital, 2.8 million for a network camera modernization program that will help upgrade obsolete cameras and establish a life cycle program. \nSPEAKER_06:  1.8 million to support the removal of defective trees at city parks by removing approximately 1200 poor quality trees and 680,000 to purchase vehicles to support an in-house crack seal and slurry program. \nSPEAKER_06:  In FY 23, 600,000 will also be included for magnetic door locks to support the city's restroom renovation initiative. This funding will allow for approximately 20 park locations retrofit and estimated 52 doors with time lock systems. 3.9 million has also been set aside for unexpected needs to be used for contingency support. And lastly, 1.7 million is planned for a debt service payment on the Mejore back bonds that is proposed to be part of the city's new 5-year infrastructure program. \nSPEAKER_06:  In addition to public safety health and infrastructure, the FY23 budget includes approximately 208,000 for administrative support. It also includes an estimated set aside of 674,000 for measure-B stabilization fund. \nSPEAKER_06:  The measure B was a companion ballot initiative to measure A, which established a budget stabilization fund. The fund receives automatic deposits of 1% for any new general tax revenue generated, beginning in FY17. \nSPEAKER_06:  Since its inception through FY21, about 2.4 million has been set aside in the measure of a stabilization front from measure A revenue. \nSPEAKER_06:  In FY22 and FY23, it's anticipating an additional 1.5 million. We'll be set aside related to measure A and deposited in the stabilization fund. \nSPEAKER_06:  The FY23 Measure B Sabilization Fund ending balance is projected to be approximately 4.4 million across all general tax deposits. \nSPEAKER_06:  The total set aside for CIP infrastructure projects in FY23 is 35 million. This includes 6.9 million from mobility projects and 28 million for public facilities, which will be presented in more detail by the Public Works Department. Also, this amount does not include additional funding from bond proceeds, which will also be presented in more details apart the next presentation in today's BOC meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  With that, I would like it handed over to Eric Lopez, Director of the Public Works Department for an update on measuring infrastructure projects. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Nader. \nSPEAKER_09:  Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm going to be presenting on the existing measure a infrastructure investment plan and some of the projects and accomplishments and some of the new projects. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_09:  Here we have a map of the original plan with the project that we that that were committed as part of the original measure a infrastructure investment plan. \nSPEAKER_09:  We're making progress. \nSPEAKER_09:  and completing the remaining project. \nSPEAKER_09:  There's a few projects that were some of the more complicated projects. \nSPEAKER_09:  that we're finishing up like a few of the major arterio street projects. \nSPEAKER_09:  a view of the more complicated reference to residential street projects. \nSPEAKER_09:  Overall, we're approaching about 85, 90 percent this fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_09:  And the remaining projects committed that we've committed to will be completed as priority as part of the next measure, very infrastructure investment plan that we will discuss. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Today, a total of 165 million has been just under 166 million. \nSPEAKER_09:  I have been, I have benefited a \nSPEAKER_09:  a variety of program, a category. \nSPEAKER_09:  with the main measure A investments going into our mobility program, which is residential street, major arterio street, secondary street, alleys improvement, sidewalk work, essentially right away improved. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next we have the Parks and Recreation category that's received 40.475 million in funding and that has supported community centers of park playgrounds including new signature playgrounds. \nSPEAKER_00:  and they have \nSPEAKER_09:  sports fields, upgrades, swimming pool improvements, etc. \nSPEAKER_09:  And last but not least, the third biggest category that's benefited from the original measure 8.5 is our public facility program with 39.55 million and that has included improvements to fire stations, other public safety facilities. \nSPEAKER_09:  our library, et cetera. \nSPEAKER_09:  We're really proud that we've exceeded the original estimated plan by just over 65 million, and we're going to be able to do more with the next plan. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm not going to go over a lot of key highlights. We reviewed this as part of our presentations to the City Council last week, but the bottom line is we've completed a lot of improvement and we're still going. \nSPEAKER_09:  and a decent improvement have been made possible because of measure 8. \nSPEAKER_09:  This is one of the largest investments we've made in a generation. \nSPEAKER_09:  And with the new plan, that is... \nSPEAKER_09:  investment is only increasing and it's really going to allow us to continue improving our community and our public access as a citywide. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  So some projects that we just wanted to highlight that we've completed two days, you know, there's some of our street light improvements. We've improved street signage. \nSPEAKER_09:  We've not only prepared our alley management plan, but we've also have repays or pays all their alley. I think there's just one remaining out. \nSPEAKER_09:  We've done a lot of alley improvement and arterio or residential street improvement. \nSPEAKER_09:  and curb and sidewalks as well. So, you know, just just just a sample of some projects that we've been able to complete. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm going to show just a few before and after pictures, just to give a sense of some of the vast improvements we see in various parts of the city, we're able to go in there and implement some of these improvements here. Finally, this is the end of the year. \nSPEAKER_09:  Roy Crop's Avenue from 536 to 636 and you see the B4N after. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Here we have an Allen in your Tremont Avenue from East of 20 Avenue to Roy Quack Avenue. You see the major start that improvement. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Pearson, A.D.A. Karpram, one of the more complicated ones. And you see the before and the after. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  This is 10-3 sidewalk that has been damaged by three routes. A lot of our trees are either diseased or there or they're dying. And some unfortunately do require, do require removal as part of the improvement. Here you see a before and after picture. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Here's a list of the parts and recreation projects that we've completed today. Highlighted are some of the more recent completed projects at the playground of Colorado Lagoon being one of them. \nSPEAKER_09:  the recreation part signature playground being another, but you know we've been able to complete a lot of parts and recreation projects as a result of the original Mejaret plan. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  I just a picture of the recently completed Polaroid Lagoon improvement. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  a couple more pictures. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then here's the picture of our latest signature playground. This one at recreation park. And this is our first diner store themed playground that we've been able to complete. So I'm really proud how we have been able to build construct \nSPEAKER_09:  series of signature playgrounds and I look forward to \nSPEAKER_09:  and you're doing that. And just improving our playgrounds in general, that's gonna be a part of our overall next infrastructure investment plan that you'll see shortly. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Just another picture. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Here's the list of our completed public facilities projects. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  I wanted to highlight some of the city-wide security cameras we recently \nSPEAKER_09:  completed improving some cameras. There's additional needs there, but we were able to complete some of those. \nSPEAKER_09:  And you have a lot of libraries, a lot of public safety facilities like our fire station that have had improvements over the current five year plan. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  So in fiscal year 22, the current fiscal year, we did a set of sites funding. \nSPEAKER_09:  to help fund three projects that would work partly to the gas control system. \nSPEAKER_09:  World O'Park, ADA RetroMent improvements and the Emergency Communications and Operations Center improvements and those three are all projects that are underway now. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next project, next delay. \nSPEAKER_09:  So here's just a recap of the current investment in the current infrastructure investment plan that's coming to an end and we're excited and gearing up for the next phase of measure a and that part of the next infrastructure investment plan that that's deeper close to part of this budget process. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  So in fiscal year 23, we do have some measure A projects that are proposed that are not related to the bond proposals that we've been discussing. And those are. \nSPEAKER_09:  categorize into two groups, the mobility and the public for the lead group, and then we'll go over those projects. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  Here's for fiscal year 23 proposed measuring on bond funding. We have a \nSPEAKER_09:  additional funds for curves and sidewalks. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's consistent with our legal obligation for ADA improvement. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then we have the theories of public facilities that have recommended additional funding. \nSPEAKER_09:  A lot of these improvements, most of these improvements are all related to the current \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  current measure a plan or our critical need. \nSPEAKER_09:  So total public facility funding proposed is 28.094 million. \nSPEAKER_09:  And is there any specific questions on any of these projects that be happy to come back in? \nSPEAKER_09:  after any question. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  And that's it for the Measure A plan. This is only focused on fiscal year 23 project. \nSPEAKER_09:  This doesn't include the overview of the new 5U. \nSPEAKER_09:  Here at Instruction of Wethamland, I believe that's part of the next presentation. \nSPEAKER_09:  So any questions? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I'll open it up with questions. Councilmember, do you want to have anything first? \nSPEAKER_04:  You ready? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll take the opportunity to \nSPEAKER_04:  to ask the question, a couple of questions regarding. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just some of the information that you provided and there was a lot. It shows that obviously, Missouri is working for us and I can't imagine. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  in the back. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know. \nSPEAKER_04:  I will be operating with city and getting projects done if we didn't have that. \nSPEAKER_04:  that revenue source. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I would just say that the voters and the council got it right. \nSPEAKER_04:  there but it's always important for us to you know have good oversight which we do have a measuring oversight committee but and obviously council oversight. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  My first question is related to fire station nine. \nSPEAKER_04:  both presentations show $1.6 million. \nSPEAKER_04:  investment for Fire Station 9. Can you clarify whether that is for the temporary facility or for the new Fire Station 9? \nSPEAKER_04:  Number one, N. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you tell me um \nSPEAKER_04:  How much we've already kind of encumbered or committed to rebuilding fire station nine. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, I'll count for member. We can, I'll look at the amount that we've satisfied so far. So I'll ask my team to pull that up. \nSPEAKER_09:  And while they do that, \nSPEAKER_09:  This allocation is the set up for construction of the new fire station night. So it's the permanent facility. \nSPEAKER_09:  If you're aware, we purchase a property on Long Beach Boulevard. \nSPEAKER_09:  We're going through the entitlement phase of that property for the future fire station. And we are setting the fire construction funding for the eventual construction of the facility. \nSPEAKER_09:  So, two days we've committed just under $7 million and this does not include the proposed fiscal year 23 amount. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this $1.6 million will be... \nSPEAKER_04:  on top of the 7 million that's already been committed for measuring funny. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, just under seven million, it's about 6.6 million around that end. So yes, this will be on top of that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  That helps me a great deal to click on my solves. \nSPEAKER_04:  Got it. And um... \nSPEAKER_04:  and also \nSPEAKER_04:  I just wanted to make a comment regarding the alley improvements, obviously, of the $165 million I think was it, about $5 million, $6 million that has been committed to alleys throughout the city. And I appreciate the graphics that showed the great work. But I also want to just make a comment in terms of our mobility plan because we don't always look at alleys as part of the mobility of our city. But I've noticed that alleys that we have repaired increased traffic may not be intended, but it may be a relief for residential streets as well. And utilization, people actually utilize their garages because they can now access some of those alleys. And so I'd like to see, you know, if anything more committed toward alleys and I know I have a number of them, just for an example, in the 8th district. And I'm sure my colleagues can give you a list of alleys throughout their districts as well. And this is one of those issues that we hear from our constituents often. When are we going to finally fix this alley? And we, Mr. Lopez, we have had some victories. We have some really, really bad alleys in the department, in your department. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just think we still have a long way to go. \nSPEAKER_04:  And if there is any extras in this, this, this, this, \nSPEAKER_04:  amazing planet that you have put forth this very ambitious plan. I would love to see those funds committed to to alleys. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  the network of camera modernization, $2.8 billion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that a plan right now? Do we have location sites identified, or is that just a number right now too? \nSPEAKER_11:  Chair Austin, I can take this one. This is Grace. This is working with our Technology and Innovation Department. It will be coordinating with departments as necessary like the Police Department. \nSPEAKER_11:  and they do have an inventory. \nSPEAKER_11:  of cameras that are um \nSPEAKER_11:  currently outdated or needing replacement and so they will be going to that inventory. And if you'd like we could get that exact list. But part of that will be, you know, doing that updating that inventory, looking to see what needs to be replaced as well as putting it on a life cycle so that there's a long-term plan to keep \nSPEAKER_00:  ambulance. \nSPEAKER_11:  this equipment up to date moving forward in the future. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I'd like to add some more detail on that. It just seems like a big number. \nSPEAKER_04:  And it's a need. We definitely want to want to, you know, replace our cameras and make sure they're modern and functioning the way they should for all kinds of good reasons. But I would love to know that this is going to be accomplished in this fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_04:  And if not, you know? \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  How much I think can be accomplished in this fiscal year? \nSPEAKER_04:  And so I would love to get some more detail in terms of what the actual plan is and how you plan it on. \nSPEAKER_04:  expanding those resources. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then I'm going to get to you, Council Member. The last point that I wanted to just pull back up, and I missed the slide. And that was related to the SLORISIL program. That might have been in the first presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you pull that slide back up? \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, that wasn't it. \nSPEAKER_09:  Katherine, what's it in the beginning of the chapter? Take out the... I think it was in the book. It was... \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it was in the first presentation. \nSPEAKER_09:  I believe it was for vehicles that were using, we're promoting some measure A, funding to purchase some vehicles associated with the Prakensnery, the OOT program. \nSPEAKER_04:  Also, the budget allocation was just for the vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right, and not all of the... \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  and uh \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Materials that it will require. \nSPEAKER_09:  correct. And then if, if the \nSPEAKER_09:  if we can turn the presentation to slide number. \nSPEAKER_09:  Let me find it here because I did see it too and I want to make sure. \nSPEAKER_09:  Play number eight, please. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  And slide number eight, you'll see there council member that the Kraken's Larry Seal Program, and this is the vehicle that that \nSPEAKER_09:  will support the in-house crack in that very field program. \nSPEAKER_09:  And this is in addition to \nSPEAKER_09:  funding that are being recommended as part of the next five year infrastructure investment plan that will help fund the program over the next five years. \nSPEAKER_09:  So when we get to the next presentation, you'll see more details on this proposal from that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate that, that clarification very much. Thank you so much. And then can you go back to your second presentation? I think it was slide 28. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. So, quick question. This is great. Give us what we estimate. What the adjusted budget has been shows that measure a is way outperforming what we projected five years ago. It also there was there was there was \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not is that 28th okay so so of the the plan and again I guess I think we should just disregard the slide at this point but the plan that was put in place for for spending here do we know or \nSPEAKER_04:  How much of that can be offset by potential funds that could be coming from the federal or state government that we may. \nSPEAKER_04:  be able to get through grads in this next fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_09:  So Chair Austin, we're going to be talking about the next the next proposed infrastructure plan as part of the next presentation, I believe, or you're going to go over the different amounts being set aside. The slide that you were looking at was the overview of the current land that we're finishing up this year. And then we're starting the new plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  In the new plan, we have included a seed funding for a multi-suita project that we believe are going to be very competitive for grant funding. \nSPEAKER_09:  And as we pursue those, our hope is that we can fully fund improvement throughout the city and leverage our measure A fund to help us with that. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's one strategy we use. Another strategy is your feed. \nSPEAKER_09:  that we're also going to be proposing setting the fight. \nSPEAKER_09:  $5 million to help with grant match requirements from either state or federal sources. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's part of the new five year plan. \nSPEAKER_09:  And as opportunities come arise, that require matches, we want to be able to. \nSPEAKER_09:  to have something already there that we can go to, we can appropriate and then we can take the batches of the grant funding. \nSPEAKER_09:  When we talk about the new 500 plus $0.00 in infrastructure and that plan over the next five years. \nSPEAKER_09:  That doesn't include the infrastructure funding that we anticipate to bring in. \nSPEAKER_09:  So the half, the $500 million will grow as we successfully bring in more funds from the federal infrastructure bill. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. I guess the point that I was also trying to make is, we can, with those extra funds from the federal government, we can shift priorities to projects like Alice and other needs in our city. It may not be funded to the level that we want to see when we find it today. \nSPEAKER_04:  My final question is related to actually one of the first slides related to the two year outreach and cleanup along the river. So this is FY 23 we're talking but we're talking about FY 23 and 24 committing $2.1 million. So I'm estimated that to be about a million dollars a little over a million dollars a year. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the question for me on that is what are we currently expanding towards cleanup along those areas that we want to put these resources for? \nSPEAKER_04:  Do we know, do we have a number for say FY21, FY22? \nSPEAKER_04:  How do we measure if that? \nSPEAKER_04:  is a significant improvement over what we're already doing. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, Chair Austin, we do have the police chief here as well as Theresa Chandler who will be \nSPEAKER_11:  really coordinating together on the River Bed cleanup effort. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm so... \nSPEAKER_11:  You wanted to \nSPEAKER_11:  Handle that, I think he's in the chambers. \nSPEAKER_11:  or Teresa is virtual. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I see Council Member Price has joined us. Welcome. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi, this is Theresa Chandler. I actually, you know what, I have to get back with the actual numbers for cleanup, but historically we've had a very small amount of one-times funds that have been shared between public works and parks and regs and health for the cleanups across the city, but you know, with a focus around the rivers. This gives us the opportunity to add more clean team and outreach efforts to really focus in on the, along the rivers, including areas that historically we've waited for the county to cover. But we've been working on an MLU with the county so that we can efficiently. \nSPEAKER_00:  clean up those areas without waiting. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so we're \nSPEAKER_00:  We've looked at the numbers over the past several years of what we've spent and this amount makes sense for how much \nSPEAKER_00:  is out there right now that needs to be addressed. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't love the chief has more to include there. \nSPEAKER_00:  or Eric. \nSPEAKER_05:  I am here. Councilmember, thank you for that question. I can speak to the operations if you had a question about the operations of the cleanups or was it specific to the funding? \nSPEAKER_04:  It was more specific to the budget, just understanding. I want to just, you know, when we throw numbers out, we're going to put 2.1 million for cleanup. \nSPEAKER_04:  and our riverbeds related to, you know, outreach and clean up. \nSPEAKER_04:  Obviously that's great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would love to be able to compare that to what we're already doing. Is that we are we increasing funding by \nSPEAKER_04:  75% are we? \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, what does that look like in terms of \nSPEAKER_04:  how it's gonna be different than what we're already doing. \nSPEAKER_05:  So yes, thank you, Councilmember. Like Theresa mentioned, the funding will be used for the multi-disciplinary approach to the cleanups. Currently, when we do a city initiative where multiple departments are involved in these cleanups, oftentimes we're doing that each individual department, and I can speak specifically for PD, we'll take overtime funding and try to pull officers out of their original assignment to help with those efforts. So we're actually taking from other areas in the department so we can supplement those city-wide efforts, and then this is directly connected to our current budget proposal to increase the number of FTEs that are in the quality of life program so we can leverage that entire unit to help facilitate these cleanups because it does take the significant amount of resources from each department. And in the past, what we've done is we've made it work. Quite honestly, we've tried to use overtime or pull staffing and make it work so we can assist one another. \nSPEAKER_00:  And just to add on to that, thank you chief, the same goes for health and for the clean team as well. So that coordinated effort. Oftentimes pulling overtime staff overtime hours for staff. So we could focus in on specific areas in the city. This dollar amount allows for more to happen on a regular basis. Of course, along the rivers. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, thank you. I'll turn it over to my colleague, Vice Chair Yorongat, and we have any questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, sorry about that. I couldn't get unmuted the first time you called on me. Sorry, but you did touch upon one item that was very \nSPEAKER_07:  That stood out to me and that was all the questions that you had on Irish Station 9. \nSPEAKER_07:  I was very much interested in how that money was going and was it for a new facility or for discrepanements of the old facilities. I'm glad to see that we are moving forward with the new facility on the Almsville work that will provide better service in that area. \nSPEAKER_07:  The other question that I had was the on slide 30 or the Singapore presentation talking about. \nSPEAKER_07:  the infrastructure reserve for Roast and H Mac are these for all public facility buildings or what are we looking at in terms of the \nSPEAKER_07:  Those reserves and how they're going to be used \nSPEAKER_09:  What slide were you referring to? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  by 30. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  You have 2.1 million per person each bag. \nSPEAKER_09:  So. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's for... \nSPEAKER_09:  That's for we have a series of rules that we've identified and then a few A-faceted that have been bellies that are in need of repairs. So this 2.1 million will help us power our ties those. \nSPEAKER_09:  you know when we \nSPEAKER_09:  when we're talking about groups and HVACs. \nSPEAKER_09:  If we can get to repair them before they fully fail, it ends up saving us thousands of dollars in the long run. So, you know, historically, we've set aside a amount, a reserve for those types of improvements, so that we don't have to wait for it. \nSPEAKER_09:  around for an appropriation in order to be able to make the repairs. \nSPEAKER_09:  So this is consistent with past practice. \nSPEAKER_09:  and it helps us address issues. The latest example is that I can think of is the \nSPEAKER_09:  If that might provide the gym. \nSPEAKER_09:  where we have midnight bathroom off. \nSPEAKER_09:  They had a leak. \nSPEAKER_09:  And you know it the repair we initially thought was going to be a $50,000 repair it ended up being a few hundred thousand dollars to fully repair that roof and that's and that's and that's been happening as the results of having these types of funds available so this will continue that reserve and would allow us to address critical needs as they come up. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, that's always just one that was that amount of money is going to be enough for the number. I mean we I know we have some aging buildings throughout the city that are in need of repair. I could tell you one in mine or the Westside Facility Center, which is, you know, is a need of a lot of love. But anyway, yeah, we'll let you see that as well. On that same page, I see that you also have. \nSPEAKER_07:  $13 million sort of a police department academy rebuild. Can you elaborate on that? That's what's going to keep the terms of what is involved in that rebuild. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, I'll start and then I'm sure the chief can elaborate. \nSPEAKER_09:  The rebuild of the police department academy was part of the original measure. \nSPEAKER_09:  infrastructure investment plan. So this will fund the remaining amount needed to be able to complete that project. \nSPEAKER_09:  It is a project that we've set aside funding over the last, I believe, two fifth years in order to fully fund this. \nSPEAKER_09:  and therefore allow us to start construction. So we're approaching 100% design and entitlement. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so we're going to be ready to start construction this next fiscal year. So in terms of the specific elements, I'll defer to the chief if he would like to talk about that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Eric, and thank you, Councilmember. Just a few brief comments on that as Eric Lopes mentioned. This is a project that is several years in the making to replace and restore the dilapidated building and training facilities that we've been operating out of for several years now. So very, very grateful to be able to have this funding to create a world-class training facility that represents the city and the department. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm glad to hear that because yeah, I had been out there when I was the recruitment officer and going up to the risk academy many times to look at the review recruits. You would see the trailers and just I think. \nSPEAKER_07:  in that facility that we're out there. So let's see that there's going to be some remodeling and rebuilding of that facility. So I'm glad to see that that's happening. \nSPEAKER_07:  Another question that I have is there was some of \nSPEAKER_07:  I forgot which page that was but there was some \nSPEAKER_07:  Let me set aside for \nSPEAKER_07:  the stormwater protection, stormwater protection plan. \nSPEAKER_07:  What does that entail? And is our \nSPEAKER_07:  We got to see you in a little more time. We'll see you in a moment here. Have a good time. \nSPEAKER_07:  The LA River stormwater, underwater stormwater must be, a lot of beach must be. Yes, much. Is that up to the end of it? Or is it different? \nSPEAKER_09:  So I'm looking through the list to see where we bounded. \nSPEAKER_09:  I believe it is a 24-hour walk. \nSPEAKER_07:  28, 28, it comes out right there as a five million dollar bill we had from \nSPEAKER_07:  The original budget in 2017 has been 26. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, so no, so it's not related to the Long Beach municipal urban stormwater treatment facility. It is a mouthful, so we just say must, I'll be right. \nSPEAKER_09:  It's not related to all the mud. \nSPEAKER_09:  The recent improvements have actually helped fund emergency repairs on our storm drain and pump station. \nSPEAKER_09:  They've helped us leverage \nSPEAKER_09:  funds to be able to obtain federal funding. I believe we got a big grant from FEMA that required some matching funds that were able to use the $5 billion. \nSPEAKER_09:  You know, these $5 million were appropriated as part of the past appropriations on measure A and there have been spent down out because we have a lot of badly needed improvements that are being made to our pump stations. That are currently being made to our pump stations. So this $5 million helps fund those and ensures that our pump stations are ready whenever there is a major storm event. Yes, I just verified that we have an $8.9 million federal grant from FEMA that we've been able to leverage these measure A funds to get more external funding to invest within our storm drain system including our pump stations. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's good to know. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then my last question is on slide number. \nSPEAKER_07:  16 up in the cup. We're going about mobility. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, Streetlight technology at 500,000. \nSPEAKER_07:  I just wondering, and this is a side question, I guess. In terms of, have we ever thought of looking at smart street light technology and going into our parks to provide a better lighting in our parts of the lot of city. \nSPEAKER_09:  So the investments that you referenced is for what's for our three-plight system. Right. So, you know, I know we piloted a technology to see if we can increase the lighting in certain intersections when needed, when is there what an emergency. So we do have that capability in specific segments of the city where we can remote control the lighting output if it's necessary during an incident response. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  In terms of parts and wreck, I don't believe we've explored that technology within our parts. \nSPEAKER_09:  But we do have a lot of lighting. \nSPEAKER_09:  and throughout our part system. But you know, that is the \nSPEAKER_09:  The money that was set aside was specifically for street life. \nSPEAKER_07:  But it's probably something that I'd like to maybe explore in the future in terms of providing better lighting in our parts, especially at night what's going on down there with all the increased activity that goes on. Not turn on. It goes on in our parts with the people just guarantee hold this time thinking that maybe we went one to look at and explore better lighting in our parts. That's all I have. Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very good questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Council member Price, you have any questions? \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm chair. I miss the presentation on this. I came in at the tail end of it. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I don't have any questions and I will not be voting on the items to sign this the presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Alrighty. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll do we know it. So based on the presentation that we've heard here today, I think it's very well laid out. I would like to extend a motion if that's in order. \nSPEAKER_04:  to um \nSPEAKER_04:  to receive a file check. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, we're seeing involved, but you know what, I'll follow up with emotion at some point later. So I'm going to move to receive a file this I don't, but I do have a motion related to \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  to our expenditures and I'd like to \nSPEAKER_04:  to, um, \nSPEAKER_04:  have under consideration by the committee. And we can talk about that in a later date. I'll just make a note of that. So, so move to receive a file this report. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  OMG! \nSPEAKER_07:  I second the chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  has been moved and seconded. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm clear. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Adelaide virtual ed. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there any public comment on the \nSPEAKER_04:  the presentations. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we've heard all from Measure A. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. Yes, we have one for public comment. \nSPEAKER_10:  If there are any members of the public comment, the public that would like to speak on this item, please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_10:  using a hand, raise hand feature or dial star 9 now and we do have one. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, day Shukla, your time begins now. \nSPEAKER_10:  Dave, you can go ahead and unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_03:  Now I'm moving. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for the presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  very much appreciate the before and after slides very briefly. I wanted to make comments on slides 20 and slides 30. \nSPEAKER_03:  I appreciate the Councilman to remember Ranga already asked the question that I've been writing. \nSPEAKER_03:  on what the HVAC reserves are for, but \nSPEAKER_03:  Just like to take this moment once again. \nSPEAKER_03:  I like it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Lhey-\uc2dc\uac04 \nSPEAKER_03:  rooftop solar is one of the quickest ways we know, with existing technology rapidly decarbonized, of buildings \nSPEAKER_03:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_03:  for all. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  I sincerely hope that it's going to be... \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Good evening. Some point on how. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city is going to convert its existing stock of city owned facilities, schools, \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  fucking laws. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll do. \nSPEAKER_03:  I mean, local black books do you also? \nSPEAKER_03:  That's one thing and then on number 20 slide 20. \nSPEAKER_03:  It used to be the trees and I grew up skateboarding on the fence and the little one. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  all the neat little things that happen to someone. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I appreciate that a lot of crews will need to be removed. \nSPEAKER_03:  But if you look at that slide, one of the things that you know this is that there's a constable lack of shape when those trees aren't replaced. When you just, you know, \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm treated over. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's the real trade-off. \nSPEAKER_03:  And while the water it does add to \nSPEAKER_03:  We are on that part of the board. \nSPEAKER_03:  and overall shade loss will increase. \nSPEAKER_03:  Garbind \u0421\u0428\u0410 with a text. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hopefully there's that. \nSPEAKER_03:  planning. \nSPEAKER_03:  please. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So any further comment? \nSPEAKER_10:  That concludes public comment, Jair. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great discussion, great presentation, let's vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  to receive a file. \nSPEAKER_01:  noted Councilwoman Price has abstained. \nSPEAKER_01:  \uc880 \uc0ac Business Enter Michelle Monk \nSPEAKER_07:  I \nSPEAKER_01:  and Chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_01:  Motion carries."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  ready. \nSPEAKER_03:  next item \nSPEAKER_02:  Recommendation to receive and file a presentation on a measure A five year infrastructure program, including bonds. \nSPEAKER_03:  So before we move forward on this step, how long do we expect this presentation to take? \nSPEAKER_03:  to \nSPEAKER_03:  How long do you think this presentation will take? \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure, Austin. We have a few slides that talk about \nSPEAKER_05:  the background behind the actual bond program. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's part of this and the funding structure. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then the rest is things that you may have already been familiar with. I'm going over the fiber infrastructure plan. So \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it could be that portion can be quick, especially since I think there were a lot of questions already on. \nSPEAKER_05:  the projects and improve. \nSPEAKER_05:  as well as tonight. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, proceed. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great, and I'll hand it over to Kevin Reiber, our Director of Financial Management. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Grace. Good afternoon, Chair Austin and committee member Ruyanga. \nSPEAKER_00:  Director Lopez in his presentation previewed fiscal year 23, measure infrastructure program and this part of the presentation and then Director Lopez's afterwards talks about the five-year. \nSPEAKER_00:  Measure A Infrastructure Program that includes bonds of the $238 million five year measure A infrastructure program Almost two thirds 150 million dollars would come from three consecutive 50 million dollar bond issues that the financial management department would coordinate Next slide please, Nader \nSPEAKER_00:  The reasons to issue bonds for long-lived infrastructure is threefold. You want to stretch out the payments for bond \nSPEAKER_00:  debt service, principal and interest over a long period of time because the people who benefit, who will benefit from the infrastructure that's built will pay for it by paying principal and interest on the bonds for their entire life. Neater, can you go to the next slide? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. The second bullet, the obvious advantage of issuing bonds for infrastructure is that you're able to get a big slug of money upfront to pay for large critical projects, whereas if you're forced to accumulate cash until a big project can be funded to take many years. And finally, the first blow on the slide one emphasized that we can't issue the debt all at once. We need to space the $50 million bond issues about two years apart to allow the public to work as a department to spend each set of bond proceeds before we issue the next one. \nSPEAKER_00:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's really hard to forecast interest rates and how much debt service will be. We're just, we're assuming current interest rates plus a little bit such that for the first $50 million bond issue under our current assumptions, it'd be $3.5 million debt service every year for 20 years. And then slightly more than that for the second and the third bond issues. We will not know the actual debt service schedule until the bonds are actually sold. And since that's one, three and five years from now, the estimate today is kind of a \nSPEAKER_00:  swag. \nSPEAKER_00:  The bonds would be sold with the backing of the whole general fund, but because that's what investors demand, but the intent is to take a measure A sales tax revenue and use that to pay the debt service. And finally, unlike general obligation bonds that go on the property tax bill and require a tax increase, and therefore a vote of the people, there is no tax increase supporting these bonds. Measure A revenue stream already exists and would be used in part to pay debt service. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's my part of the presentation and I can turn it over to Director Lopez for the details if we have the time. \nSPEAKER_00:  here. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Director Riper. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've gone through the list of projects, so I just wanted to show them and then I can come back and answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you go to the next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  This chart should be familiar to you. We presented it previously, and it shows the amount of investment, a recommended investment in each category, and the total over investment over the five-year timeline, which is just under 522 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  You've also seen the map with the different projects and the different categories spread out throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  The red marks obviously is the street. We added red dotted lines this time around to signify which the streets were going to be able to treat with crack and flurry seal as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here we have listed all of the park improvement projects are being proposed as part of the five year infrastructure investment path. \nSPEAKER_01:  to note because the bond will come in $50 million increment. \nSPEAKER_01:  We will have to prioritize. \nSPEAKER_01:  the \nSPEAKER_01:  the different projects and there are some projects that are closer to shovel ready than other projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  And there's some projects that will require planning and design that make it. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then we'll get fully funded when it's ready to go. That is finalizing those details now to be able to present. \nSPEAKER_01:  so that the council as well informs us. \nSPEAKER_01:  How a WDF 5-year infrastructure investment plan? \nSPEAKER_01:  will be implemented as the additional bond funding becomes available. So on this slide, you have the proposed park improvement on the next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  On this slide you have the proposed public facility projects improvements. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  In the next two slides, you have the right away water quality and climate action type of improvement. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so you'll see some in this slide and if we go to the next slide you'll see some additional. \nSPEAKER_01:  And this slide also includes the mobility. So again, major street, secondary street, residential street, the alley program that's all the amounts are listed here that are proposed over the next five fiscal years. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that concludes the presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, so I'll ask a quick question. We're good, regarding the five year plan that you just laid out. It just shows that a little bit will over 60% of that will be dedicated toward mobility. \nSPEAKER_03:  Meaning residential streets. \nSPEAKER_03:  and streets that are traveled by the hickory \nSPEAKER_03:  Venho! \nSPEAKER_03:  Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  That is correct, Chair Austin. So the biggest investment is in our residential street. \nSPEAKER_01:  in our major and secondary three. Um, uh, Thursday. \nSPEAKER_01:  $5 million that are being proposed for Allie. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then there's sidewalks and curb ramps. \nSPEAKER_01:  that are being proposed as well. So \nSPEAKER_01:  And then \nSPEAKER_01:  The list of projects in the mobility program are all listed on slide page 26. \nSPEAKER_01:  So you can see the allocation there, but yes, that is the majority of funding are to be proposed toward that program. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so the bonding, the whole idea about behind this and \nSPEAKER_03:  And I've been one council member who's been asking questions and kind of advocating for some sort of fast track utilizing, you know, leveraging the resources that we know that we will already get to to fast track the projects that are important to our residents, particularly residential streets. I know they definitely cost to bond, but I think in a long one it's worth it. We want to see results sooner than later. I'm taking to a \nSPEAKER_03:  My colleagues. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye, see you, Ranga. \nSPEAKER_03:  in questions, comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, I have no questions, comment, say we're already asking with the previous presentations. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. Council Member Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you very much for your work, Eric and Kevin. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right. \nSPEAKER_03:  So hearing that, no more comments from the committee. Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on this item in zoom, please use the raise hand feature or dial star 9 now. \nSPEAKER_04:  No public comment, Chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, great. That, thank you all for your time today. All the very, very lightning information. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  And I'd like to... \nSPEAKER_03:  Call this meeting to wait. Don't need to take another public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  First we need a motion and a vote for item three and then we do general public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  I move to a receiving file this item. \nSPEAKER_02:  back in. \nSPEAKER_03:  Alright, move this second in. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ibn \nSPEAKER_03:  Follow the comment on that. \nSPEAKER_02:  No, move on to vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So, all right, this will. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilwoman Price. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02: Woman \u05d4\u05e0\ud0c0\u4eca\u56de~) \nSPEAKER_02:  I \nSPEAKER_02:  and chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there any general public? \nSPEAKER_02:  comment."
