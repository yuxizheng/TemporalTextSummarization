        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  I am an I. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Let's hear item number two, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Item number two is a recommendation to receive and follow report on the City of Long Beach's economic recovery efforts and Updates on its projected financial status as impacted by COVID-19 \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, and I'll hand it over to our economic development director, John Kaisley. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Chair Richardson. Hopefully everybody can see. \nSPEAKER_03:  slides that I'm going to share via my screen. \nSPEAKER_03:  And this is actually a content that was provided to the City Council by our Finance Director, John Gross, who would otherwise be here today. \nSPEAKER_03:  about a week ago. \nSPEAKER_03:  So just as context, we are in our current fiscal year right now for the City of Long Beach. This will be a 20. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that runs through September 30. So we are actually on a what's called a federal fiscal year, October 1 to September 30. \nSPEAKER_03:  So fiscal year 20, which we're in right now, will be going for approximately six months, just under that. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the shortfall right now that's been shared with the City Council based on what we now know and what we assume the remainder of this fiscal year is projected to be somewhere between $25 and $41 million. Now that shortfall, what that consists of primarily, this is for the general fund. So what I'm talking about is about a $500 million general fund. \nSPEAKER_03:  And when we talk about $41 million, we're talking about, you know, 8% this is a major shortfall, 8% to 10%. Now, that might not seem as much when the Kurds and reports out of the city of Los Angeles. \nSPEAKER_03:  Santa Monica, San Diego, cities that are projecting much higher deficits. And that's because we have a different mix of revenues. Longings is a group that diversified economic base. We have everything from oil revenue. We have a strong hospitality industry, so transient occupancy tax. We have a strong retail base with sales tax. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then there are many other different types of readily collected. \nSPEAKER_03:  The list is it over four years of on 80 revenues. And that diverse base gives us a little bit of a hedge again. Some of the big downturns. \nSPEAKER_03:  that impact certain sectors more than others. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so the most severe impacts of course are around retail. \nSPEAKER_03:  So our sales tax is a great revenue for us. \nSPEAKER_03:  And of course hospitality, we talked about transient occupancy drafts, which is the Fed tab. So when visitors come to the city, hotels which have historically been performing a little last few years at almost 3% occupancy, which is an amazing trend that we've been experiencing in the city, have dropped in some cases 10% occupancy in below. And so, \nSPEAKER_03:  That is a huge hit for all of them. \nSPEAKER_03:  In 21, so starting October 1st of this year, which will go through September 30th, 2021, we call that FY21 or FY21. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're in the process of creating our budget now, which will be presented to the City Council in less than two months. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's likely going to be worse than the projected 9 to 16 million dollars that we're now protecting. We think that the biggest impacts of the lockdown stage of COVID-19 will be over by then, by the start of October than the fiscal year. So that's why you'll see the short projected shortfall to be less than we have seen this coming. The lockdown is really a hammer that I'd rather be changed. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I would expect them to be moving from here. \nSPEAKER_03:  However, out years. \nSPEAKER_03:  We expect that they'll probably be worse than this $9.61. But we'll give you some quick update on that next. But uncertainty is a high. As you know, every sector, every economist, every political year, we're discussing uncertainty. And that's just because we're building what it looks like today. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we're dealing with an enemy here, the 30 virus. \nSPEAKER_03:  back and coming down, we don't have a vaccine. And so uncertainty in the market is also extremely high, which impact our revenues. \nSPEAKER_03:  and apply for \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  from \nSPEAKER_03:  And of course, the economic security. \nSPEAKER_03:  likely that the shortfalls. \nSPEAKER_03:  will be worse than what we're thinking here, rather than better. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll just wrap this up by talking about the general fund again and the preliminary after nearly in the COVID-19. So, this was an anticipating event for us. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in the fiscal year 2020, these are all un-budgeted costs that we never, ever expected to see when we could account for located budget back in the fall of last year. We're looking at general funding shortfalls, just, we're raising the un-budgeted expenses for COVID-19 and COVID-19 costs to be around 9 million. In the other funds, we think the airport fund, a port of long-distance any enterprise that we operate, development services, gas and oil. Those funds right in our projecting about 5 million, so about 14 overall. And what we're hoping is that we can get an investment so far when we receive some re-enversions from the federal government for email-related disaster relief activities, a pre-knowledge, and we're hoping to get additional funds over the coming weeks. We're in our large city, we're just under 5 million, but we said we're just under it. We don't get the automatic email-in-knowledge. \nSPEAKER_03:  our future. The large city with 500 L. New York like the city of Sacramento and others on the \nSPEAKER_03:  I saw it so we're going to have to wait and see and hopefully get some of the river feet after we've got those river feet. So I'm going to wrap up the report. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's not a good one, but we want to do. \nSPEAKER_03:  quantify a little bit the economic development plan to be the council. This this community in particular is the part of the \nSPEAKER_03:  making recommendations back to the City Council about how do we stabilize our revenue change? What are the lessons you need to make? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  so that we can grow those revenue streams and really be the philosophy, the economic philosophy between that by investing in our businesses, by investing in our employers, by investing in resources, in the sector that really drive our local economy. It's a virtuous cycle and it's a reciprocal. We invested in you. You make money, you grow the economy and you benefit from the factors that are generally between that and so if you do well, private sector, the city does well. I'll wrap it up, Chair Richardson, happy to answer any questions or any other questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  So thank you. Thank you, John. It's one of the ways. \nSPEAKER_02:  The City Council has an opportunity to review these slides with some important that. \nSPEAKER_02:  that this committee has had an opportunity to take a deeper dive. I don't have questions for you, but just some \nSPEAKER_02:  comments about what we're up against here. \nSPEAKER_02:  Economic crisis caused by COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_02:  has a direct impact to the level of service that we can provide as a city. \nSPEAKER_02:  and it's important for people to understand that. \nSPEAKER_02:  The longer our economy is shut down. \nSPEAKER_02:  due to the health crisis. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh \nSPEAKER_02:  the ripple effects that it will cause throughout the community in terms of \nSPEAKER_02:  on real major service reductions and cuts. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so there's a correlation. \nSPEAKER_02:  everything we do is about protecting the public health. \nSPEAKER_02:  of our residents. \nSPEAKER_02:  and at the same time. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have to factor in. \nSPEAKER_02:  The fact that if services are not available in some of our most vulnerable communities, we may make the problem worse. So it's really a balancing act. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman Durango, you want to chime in on this? \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm hoping that you can hear me. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm still sort of experimenting with this. \nSPEAKER_01:  You're doing great. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm new to it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm used to uh \nSPEAKER_01:  Zoom, not this one. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will work through it. \nSPEAKER_01:  You mentioned, you made some references John to what's going on in Sacramento. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the issues that are going on there. \nSPEAKER_01:  We were at right now with that. \nSPEAKER_01:  and what the mayor has been working tirelessly and trying to get the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  where it needs to be in regards to \nSPEAKER_01:  some of the uh... \nSPEAKER_01:  proposals that are out there for \nSPEAKER_01:  assistance that we need here. \nSPEAKER_01:  so that we, the economic impacts that we're suffering now are as \nSPEAKER_01:  stay for deep as we can as we'll probably expect it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So can you elaborate a little bit more on what's going on in Sacramento? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, so first and foremost Sacramento and agencies like the Employment Development Department. \nSPEAKER_03:  receive federal appropriation through the CARES Act. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that's the major stimulus act that since I, as you all know, now, \nSPEAKER_03:  that have come through Congress. And so the state will oftentimes be the first stop for those loans, and then those monies are allocated out for employment development, loans, and other things. And so one portion of the stimulus has to do with relief to local governments. And so that's a big issue for this committee to watch and advocate for, because it's not a guarantee that the city, because we're not considered a city of 500 thousand or more, we're not going to get a direct appropriation with city.LA and some of the cities that are a lot of the mess. We don't want to get buried as a smaller city in the reappropriation. Also, we are our own health jurisdiction. Most cities are not health jurisdictions. They are part of accounting jurisdiction. So all that money that is going to public health, \nSPEAKER_03:  and the public health emergency typically is going to counties. And it's important for Long Beach to also be at the table advocating as its own health jurisdiction along the Pasadena and in the city of Berkeley, because we need those direct funds to manage our health issue. So those are two major issues that have to do with decisions and funds that are passing through Sacramento. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, John. I also wanted to \nSPEAKER_01:  have you covered a bit more terms while we're at with the reopening of Long Beach? \nSPEAKER_01:  uh \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  as I said a couple of weeks ago. \nSPEAKER_01:  for Long Beach Alba testing. \nSPEAKER_01:  and uh... \nSPEAKER_01:  better we have access to testing. \nSPEAKER_01:  for our residents, the better we're able to get engaged as to where we're at. \nSPEAKER_01:  as a \nSPEAKER_01:  municipality in regards to being able to. \nSPEAKER_01:  Open up more businesses or not because testing is huge. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's where it's all that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that the mayor recently is looking at maybe purchasing some more testing kits. \nSPEAKER_01:  for Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we're working on that hard. \nSPEAKER_01:  any indications from your end. \nSPEAKER_01:  working with the task force or the committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  in regards to how they view \nSPEAKER_01:  whether we can go to a stage \nSPEAKER_01:  three while we're stage two correct. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then going to a stage three and \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to be a stage four into the governor's schedule, but... \nSPEAKER_01:  maybe going to stage three. \nSPEAKER_01:  and you'll that breeders be born there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, of course, the testing efforts are being run by our policy community through what those call their emergency operation center. That's a collection of both our health department leadership, public safety, city management, finance. And so they've been able to boost our testing capability through both public, private, county, as well as our own health department testing. We see that continuing to increase through more public, private partnerships and more private sector laboratories, as well as private health insurance, picking up the costs for those that are ensured. And so right now we have testing capability for 1000 tests a day, which is incredible, given that just four weeks ago, we could only do about 50. So the city is rapidly ramping up, especially capability on extending that to people who before it was just a symptomatic and now we're starting to broaden that to more groups and first responders and everybody else. And so as, you know, we can get more private sector participation, health department, you know, the health insurance plans as well as the private labs are both in the capability. That will be the solution really for a lot of our major employers to be able to cover more people. And as you know, what we're hearing from the recovery task force groups is that the private sector employers want to know that they have the ability to provide the testing that their employees can return and re-retested so that they can stay working. So it's going to be a public private partnership. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's been initially a government response. \nSPEAKER_03:  And now we really need the partner with the private sector to make it universal. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and interject. \nSPEAKER_02:  And thank you so much, John. I'll tell you John and Councilman Iranga. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  plenty of tremendous insights. We'll have some time to ask a few questions, council member, at the end. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't want to get to some of our guests that we have so we can really take into their feedback. \nSPEAKER_02:  At this point, I think that's... \nSPEAKER_02:  We're we're we're we've made up a little bit of time on this presentation. We can get to the next one so \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll entertain a motion to... \nSPEAKER_02:  receiving file this part of the \nSPEAKER_02:  recommendation. Councilor Ming-Rang-Gud? \nSPEAKER_02:  more to receive a file of the presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Our second, let's go ahead and go to a roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember Uwanga. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice-chairman Go. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right."

Item 3. \nSPEAKER_00:  Recommendation to receive in follow report from representatives of the labor sector regarding the impact of the COVID-19 emergency on workers. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this time I'm going to introduce Mr. Rob not off who's the legislative director. \nSPEAKER_04:  for the LA County Federation of Labor and he's got a presentation and a number of \nSPEAKER_04:  representatives and so at this point I'll hand the \nSPEAKER_04:  floor over to Mr. Nile. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, thank you, Councilman Richardson, and thank you to every Head of Members of the Committee here. We're very pleased to have been invited to this meeting to be able to present everything that we've been up to here. And also the opportunity to just reintroduce the general public to the labor move. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so for those who don't know me, my name is Robert Noetop. I'm the policy director at the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. And all together, we make up, we are represented by 300 affiliates and over 800,000 hardworking women and men across the LA region. \nSPEAKER_06:  I've got a bit of a PowerPoint here to try to... \nSPEAKER_06:  First things up just so you don't get super bored listening just to me. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, we can see you. \nSPEAKER_04:  We can see your screen. \nSPEAKER_06:  Perfect. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so for folks who aren't aware, as I said, we represent, we have 300 affiliates in 800,000, 800,000 hardworking women and men. For those who don't really quite understand what that means, it's, we represent a number of sectors, right? So within our umbrella, we represent the nurses who folks, and these times fully understand and appreciate the value that they bring. \nSPEAKER_06:  Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  with sheriffs and fire. \nSPEAKER_06:  We represent the livery drivers. We represent construction workers. We represent sanitation workers and hospitality workers. \nSPEAKER_06:  We represent our teachers. \nSPEAKER_06:  We represent grocery workers and we represent jangers and we represent workers across all industries. \nSPEAKER_06:  And our basic belief is that all labor has dignity. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's a famous saying that was once said by the late great Dr. Mark Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I don't think that that statement rings any true, it rings just as true as it did when he originally said it as it does today. When we're talking about the workers who you see on your screen here, when we talk about grocery. \nSPEAKER_06:  and we talk about janitors and we talk about our heroes. \nSPEAKER_06:  doing the God's work in the hospitals. \nSPEAKER_06:  and because of all labor has dignity. \nSPEAKER_06:  what we really fight for and what we really believe in. \nSPEAKER_06:  is that regardless of the industry that any worker works in. \nSPEAKER_06:  that all workers deserve to have a few basic essentials. And boil down, we really just want to make sure that everyday workers have a roof over their head. \nSPEAKER_06:  a little more food on their table. \nSPEAKER_06:  And a little more milk in the fridge. And those are the basic tenants of exactly who we are and what we've represented and what we aim to do. \nSPEAKER_06:  And since the start of this pandemic, when we're talking about just putting a little more food on the table, we've been extremely busy and we've been literally putting our money where our mouth is and we have literally been feeding people as the pandemic has come across. So the past eight weeks or seven weeks. We've had 22 food distributions and we've actually fed close to 160,000 individuals who have been struck. We've been hard hit by this pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we've also had two such events we've hosted in Bomb Beach. We hosted the first one at the Brooklyn within a week. \nSPEAKER_06:  of the governor's announcement about the emergency order. And we were able to feed approximately 8,800 individuals that back in March. And then we just hosted one this past weekend. Was Senator Gonzalez and Councilman Richardson over at Jordan High School, or over 10,000 people were fed? \nSPEAKER_06:  And collectively, when we talk about Long Beach and what we've been able to do, you've already been able to feed over 19,000 individuals. And just to put that in context, what that really means through social math. \nSPEAKER_06:  is if you were to go to any Laker game \nSPEAKER_06:  The Staples Center would be a capacity with the number of people we fed with 200 waiting on the outside trying to get tickets. That's the impact that we've had just here in Long Beach over the past seven weeks. So again, we've really been trying to stay true to who we are and making sure that we could do our part as a community partner to help those when they're when in their greater and times of the greatest need. \nSPEAKER_06:  Here's a quick little video that just summarizes everything that we've been up to with the food distributions. \nSPEAKER_02:  All these union members here participate in and volunteer in their time. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, it's such a quite hard. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  yea both \nSPEAKER_02:  to do this for me, made it so. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is hard and difficult times that we've never been through. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want people in the community to understand. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're all in this together. \nSPEAKER_05:  The president of each artist \nSPEAKER_05:  so we'll bounce to theligen cheek on At \ufffd\u5e6b HBO and us. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so you can see, again, what we've been up to, which is our members who are really trying to do their best to make sure that they're a community partner and. \nSPEAKER_06:  uh \nSPEAKER_06:  With those food banks, we've been able to partner with the LA regional food bank. \nSPEAKER_06:  and with our partner, our close affiliate labor community services and just within Long Beach alone, we've been able to distribute over $1.1 million worth of food donations to needy residents. \nSPEAKER_06:  in addition to that. \nSPEAKER_06:  We've also been digging in on some policies here because we want to make sure it's our belief that what happens in the workplace is a reflection of what's taking place in the great overall society. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we've been pushing to try to make sure that we can have some basic worker protections because when we talk about our central workers and we talk about our grocery stores these are places where the public is still interacting in the midst of a pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we understand that worker protections within those stores are going to ultimately protect the general public. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we were able to work with Mayor Garcia with his emergency order in his health order to make sure that there were basic worker protections in place that would protect both the workers and the public. But basic things like ensuring that folks have face coverings when they walk into stores and making sure that that employees had access to that and that wasn't coming out of their pocket. That would be provided by their employers and making sure that all workers could go and wash their hands every 30 minutes as needed to make sure they could adhere to CDC guidelines and a number of other basic. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh \nSPEAKER_06:  remedies within the workplace. \nSPEAKER_06:  Additionally, we want to make sure that everybody had access to sick days. We know that if you can be asymptomatic with the coronavirus and that if you do have it, your recommendation is to make sure that you stay quarantined for at least two weeks. And so the Long Beach City Council just moved forward with passing a supplemental sick leave policy to make sure that people would be paid to stay home and that they were incentivized to do right, to stay home, to get over the virus and not writ, yet risk of going back out into the public and infecting additional people. \nSPEAKER_06:  The other piece that we moved was additional grocery protections and the next speaker will get into that a little bit more. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then finally, the city of Long Beach moved forward with the right of recall and work of retention policy. And as we're discussing about reopening the economy and how we're going to do this, for us, this was just a common sense bread and butter policy. \nSPEAKER_06:  to make sure that if you want to move things forward, what better policy than to make sure that the workers who were laid off as no fault of their own, but just as a result of the pandemic? \nSPEAKER_06:  and the ability to go back to that job. \nSPEAKER_06:  And they have the ability to bring all of their experience and knowledge to get that job up and running as quickly and efficiently as possible. And it's those workers who actually bring the spirit and the character to that job. So we made sure that all workers within the hospitality and janitorial sector have first right of refuse. So to go back to their job, once we reopen this pandemic, and it's going to be especially critical for them, because these industries are overwhelmingly comprised of people of color. \nSPEAKER_06:  When we take a look at the neighbors have been hit hardest by this pandemic, it's the data clearly shows. \nSPEAKER_06:  communities of color taking it on the chin more so than other communities. So this policy goes a long way in really addressing that issue and making sure that workers who have been laid off and have had their their bills stacking up on them have the ability to get back get that job and start getting their life back together as quickly as possible. \nSPEAKER_06:  But I'm going to. \nSPEAKER_06:  and my time there and just say thank you to Mary Garcia. \nSPEAKER_06:  And everybody on the members of the City Council for moving forward with these with these bread and butter policies. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm going to hand it over to the real all stars of this presentation who are Matt Bell, the Secretary of Treasury of UFCW Local 324, and Anton Farron B, the Vice President of SCI-U-US-WW. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks, Rob. This is Matt out. Can you guys hear me? \nSPEAKER_01:  We can air it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I'm the Secretary Treasurer here at UFCW Local 324. I want to thank the committee and the council members for giving me some time here. We represent roughly 16,000 grocery workers in Orange County in South LA. We also represent retail drug workers and ride aid and CVS. And we also represent the cannabis workers in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  And when this pandemic hit, I want to thank the Council for taking action and the mayor for moving forward because grocery stores were one of the most significantly hit. \nSPEAKER_01:  uh \nSPEAKER_01:  basically businesses because they were the only ones left open. The lines out the door, the panic buying, those things started to commence and it's our members, the grocery workers who were on the front line. I know a lot of, there's been a lot of rhetoric and they about them being heroes and they definitely are, but I can tell you when grocery workers sign up to be grocery workers, it's not like a police officer or a nurse or a fireman who know what they're signing up for. When grocery workers signed up, they didn't expect to be on the front line of a pandemic, but I can't believe the bravery that they have showing up to work every single day knowing what they're exposed to and out there. But I know the council want to thank them for their action and the mayor's action. Some of the things that came out that Long Beach was ahead of everybody else and is to install Plexiglas for the cashiers. So there was less contact, the gloves, the mandatory PPE, the extended sick leave. And Long Beach is one of the cities that actually mandate that customers wear masks when they go in and also get into in just a second. I think that's going to be one of the key things that's important as the country and California and Long Beach starts to open back up to make sure that this virus doesn't spread because our members are out there in LA County. It's been mandated that essential workers have to wear a mask. But there seems to be this fight back and forth with kind of a culture war now that some community folks don't want to. And I hear every single day stories from people that work in the grocery stores that have to work eight hours standing next to people not wearing masks and coughing. And they know they have to go home to their family and are potentially exposing them. \nSPEAKER_01:  but it's been a significant struggle for our members, not everything happened right out the gate, but Long Beach itself was one of the pioneers in pushing for safety for grocery workers, and still grocery stores are one of the few things that are open, and our intent in working with cities such as Long Beach is to make sure that these grocery stores don't become centers of infection. As people are home and people are doing the things that they need to do to flatten the curve, the last thing we need is grocery workers and the grocery stores being the place where this infection spreads. \nSPEAKER_01:  So all of those things were incredibly helpful. Obviously one of the concerns that we have as a union is that yes, these laws were put in place and our representatives and our stewards and our members out there, we educated them about that. So they were able to actually implement a lot of these things and make sure managers and the companies abided by them. Clearly in some of the non-union stores, some of these laws that have been passed by the city of Long Beach aren't happening. So it's a concern that we have that other grocery workers that don't have the protections of the union are still being exposed to this virus and don't have the full force to enforce these laws that the city's placed in. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  a couple other things just to point out real quick. \nSPEAKER_01:  A lot of these companies right out the gate made a significant amount of money with basically selling everything on the shelf. I think it's still hard to get toilet paper and paper towels, unfortunately. But there's still making lots of money and a lot of these companies did the right thing out the gate by giving hero pay or appreciation pay or what we call hazard pay, $2 an hour extra to the employees. Unfortunately, greed is starting to become an issue and these companies are trying to pull that back a little bit. Kroger, which is food, philess and rouse, which there are many of in the city of Long Beach, not only in North Long Beach, but in the urban areas as well, is trying to remove the hero pay. In the meantime, while the companies are making record profits. So \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, we see this. It's not like the virus is going away any time soon, and it's not like the hazards that these grocery workers face day in and day out are going away. So it's nice to have the protection. But that extra paid significantly helps. I also want to thank the city. You're one of the few cities that actually has testing for essential workers and many of our grocery workers have actually utilized that. And it's important that they do get testing here in Orange County. There isn't prevalent testing. But thank God there isn't long beach because that'll be one of the major things along with math as As the city start to open up to make sure that this virus doesn't spread. \nSPEAKER_01:  But with that, I just want to thank the city and this committee and the council members for everything they've done and their continued support for for the grocery workers or these essential workers that are out there. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Matt. And for this the work, for this the work and we receive that, what we'll do is we're going to try to keep everyone's comments around three, four minutes so we can. \nSPEAKER_04:  I want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to get in Robert. \nSPEAKER_04:  You wanna? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  and say in our next speaker will be Anton Farim, the Vice President from US, S-E-I-U-U-S-W-W, who can just talk about inherent role of janitors and what we need to be doing as we reopen the economy. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_04:  and time. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  You have floor Mr. Harvey. \nSPEAKER_04:  You're muted, sir. \nSPEAKER_04:  and time you're muted. \nSPEAKER_04:  years. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Nah, I was practice. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure thing. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Hey, thanks, Rob. Appreciate your chairman Rex for giving us some time to talk. \nSPEAKER_03:  with the committee today. I just want to really just kind of talk a little bit about \nSPEAKER_03:  what it means to reopen the economy and impact on the \nSPEAKER_03:  folks who are actually doing the work. I mean, we've already talked a little bit about what's taking place with the road through workers. I also want to talk about the folks who are also considered essential workers like security officers and janitors who go to work every day and face in the real reality of what it means of not being able to come home or being exposed to this virus. You know, I think that when we talk about the health risk of these workers, we're not just talking about the folks who are doing the work, we're also talking about public safety and public health. This is not just impacting these specific workers, but it's also impacting those who are residents of Long Beach and other cities within the county and across the country. One of the things that I just want to highlight is that when we talk about, think about reopening the economy, regardless of what city we're talking about, it's important to note that while these workers who are currently considered essential workers are at risk and going to work every day, just imagine what it means that when folks come back into the workplace, the impact that that's going to have. They're already at risk, so it's going to put them more at risk. So I think that that's important to highlight and important for people to understand. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think also another thing is that when we talk about janitors and particularly, when we talk about the work that they're doing and being able to quickly go through their work just to try to get through the day and get through the shift, that impact is going to be that much more greater when we talk about people coming in because of the requirements of what is going to mean to disinfect different floors, different tenant offices and the trash and the bathrooms and things of that nature. So I think that when you talk about the spread of the virus, a lot of it is through means a lot of people don't think about when you go into that bathroom, touching that door, turning on that faucet, flushing that urinal, all of those things have deep impacts and we need to be very mindful about what it's going to take in order to create confidence and safety for residents, not only in long beach but across the country. And then I think it's also important to know which I think personally has been getting lost in this narrative around the people who has impacted our people of color. When we talk about grocery store workers, when we talk about hotel workers, janitors, security officers, airport workers, even nurses, right? A lot of these folks and the majority of them are people of color. We're talking about black and brown communities, right? And I think that that's important to highlight that even when you look at the numbers of those who have been exposed and tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, as well as those who are passing away and dying from this virus, right? And so I think that that's an important thing to highlight here and not to be taken lightly because it is the communities of color that are being impacted by this. And then the last thing that I would just like to mention is that the need, I think we all could agree that we want our economy to get back on track. We want people to get back to work and us being in labor, no one knows and understands that more than we do. But I think it matters in terms of how we do that, right? I think it's important to state what we value. It should never be a situation where we value money over someone's life. And I'm all for getting back on track, but it would expense. And so I just want to highlight for the group here, the importance of what we've been thinking about in labor, in terms of what my union and my local was thinking about. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what it means to come back into this economy, but also keep it in mind that when you see a grocery store worker or a health care worker or a teacher or whatever, just make sure that you kind of say thank you. These folks are literally putting their lives at risk to keep us safe. And I don't think we can do enough of that, because literally we're talking about a life-of-death situation. So I want to thank everybody for allowing us this time, and I really appreciate you bringing us on. \nSPEAKER_06:  And thank you. You want to close it out, Robert. And so thank you everybody for your time. I know we went a little over so apologies for that, but I just wanted to reiterate one additional thing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  that was shared with me from USW and janitorial workers. So their workload has doubled. \nSPEAKER_06:  since the great recession. And so that's trying to fly through your shift and trying to clean things. When you're trying to properly sanitize this effect, \nSPEAKER_06:  and you have a unrealistic workload, what does that mean for public health? \nSPEAKER_06:  And for everybody else who goes into those public and private spaces. So for us, our closing statement is this, when workers are better off, the public is better off. \nSPEAKER_06:  When workers are safer, the public is safer. And when workers have economic job security, our economy is stronger. So thank you for your time, and we're happy to answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, let me be on behalf of the committee. Thank you all for coming to share in your comments. We thought it was important that. \nSPEAKER_04:  the individuals who are on the front line and working. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  We're having an official way to \nSPEAKER_04:  beyond the record and share their experiences and their input as the city makes decisions about the economy that impacts all of us. \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilman Yoranga, you have some thoughts or comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, I just that you don't want to... \nSPEAKER_01:  Express my thank you to all the workers out there who are. \nSPEAKER_01:  doing God's work. \nSPEAKER_04:  every day. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Absolutely, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So with this, we thank you and Councilman Yorang that you want to make the motion to receive a file that's report. \nSPEAKER_04:  and move to receipt and file the report. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you our second, let's have a roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Council member Uruonga. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice-chairman Go. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair Richardson."

So each it looks like we're breaking out in about 15 minutes. \nSPEAKER_05:  each. \nSPEAKER_05:  So next we're going to hear from representatives from the main factory industry. Let's hear item number four please. Madam Clerk. \nSPEAKER_01:  Item 4, recommendation to receive and follow report from representatives of the manufacturing industry regarding the impact of the COVID-19 emergency. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you and in structuring these two meetings. \nSPEAKER_05:  John Keissler, our Economic Development Director, really emphasized how important it is. \nSPEAKER_05:  We have our local manufacturers have an opportunity to weigh in here. John, would you like to introduce your guests? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, of course. Thank you Chair Richardson and Council Member Yerenga. \nSPEAKER_04:  As you know, we had talked about \nSPEAKER_04:  the diversity of the Long Beach economy and one of the key sectors for employment and also a major \nSPEAKER_04:  a sector that is important to the nation as a whole is the manufacturing sector that is located in Long Beach and provides a range of employment opportunities. \nSPEAKER_04:  as well as economic impact. So we're going to start out with the perspective of a larger \nSPEAKER_04:  Manufacturer that has been with the city for decades in north of each in fact located in your district council member \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  GADC, America and then Jim Zemer, who has been around. \nSPEAKER_04:  Long Beach and around the manufacturing industry. This is not his first recession, but this might be one of the first times that they've had to respond to a public health crisis like this. He's going to show how Toyota is navigating that and creating a safe place for workers to come back, as well as their partnership with their own union. And then we also wanted to get the perspective \nSPEAKER_04:  of a smaller manufacturing company that's in the city. It is actually dealing with a different perspective of the industry and a different perspective from the startup that they have done in plastics. And so, \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll also have Bruce talk a bit about their journey and what closed loop is is experienced and ultimately how they're navigating the exit from the crisis. So how about we start with Jim and then we'll go to Bruce. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thanks John, I'm going to try to share my screen here. \nSPEAKER_03:  if I can pull this off. \nSPEAKER_05:  We see your screen. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  And get back to the beginning. \nSPEAKER_03:  So thanks to the committee, Council Member Richardson for this opportunity. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just briefly, TBC is Toyota's oldest manufacturing plant. \nSPEAKER_03:  located in North Long Beach off Paramount Boulevard. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have just over 250 \nSPEAKER_03:  Teamsters, local 848 represented team members. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have a great partnership with Louis Diaz and Eric Tate and his team. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the team members. \nSPEAKER_03:  We do about $180 million a year in sales. \nSPEAKER_03:  And, um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Robert, I hope this \nSPEAKER_03:  presentation resonates especially with you and \nSPEAKER_03:  The people that you represent and a lot of the things that you talked about, I think you'll see we're taking to heart. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  First of all, really what I want to talk about is how we're going to return our team members safely to work. \nSPEAKER_03:  So since March 20th, basically we've been shut down. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have run a small piece of our business which was deemed essential. \nSPEAKER_03:  which was for past model service parts for the dealerships. \nSPEAKER_03:  And um \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, this, the COVID I think caught everybody by surprise. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we... \nSPEAKER_03:  shutdown as the economy started to shut down. \nSPEAKER_03:  And people were in their homes not buying cars. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we are just wrapping up tonight is eight weeks of shutdown and Monday morning. I'm glad to say we're coming back to work. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's been a long, long way. \nSPEAKER_03:  One thing to note during that we did not lay anybody off. \nSPEAKER_03:  during that entire eight \nSPEAKER_03:  And we did have shared sacrifice between \nSPEAKER_03:  our early team members and our salary team members as we went through. \nSPEAKER_03:  planning for this. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  We've been focusing on building. \nSPEAKER_03:  key safety measures in as we prepare to return to work. \nSPEAKER_03:  We also had an opportunity to get out into the community and we helped. \nSPEAKER_03:  two companies that are in the COVID space. One was a company called Viere and Palm Springs, they make ventilators. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the other was de-assaurant molecular over in Cyprus real close to here. \nSPEAKER_03:  and they actually make test kits for, um, \nSPEAKER_03:  for COVID. \nSPEAKER_03:  And at the same time in the Long Beach area, we \nSPEAKER_03:  produced and donated 2,500 face shields to local hospitals. \nSPEAKER_03:  So our basic philosophy. \nSPEAKER_03:  for Toyota is respect for people and it truly is respect for people. We're striving to provide a safe work environment for our team members when they come back to work. \nSPEAKER_03:  We've been guided by the resources and requirements of the CDC. \nSPEAKER_03:  OSHA, state and local laws and orders as we've gone through this journey to prepare our plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, shown here are the, um, is the \nSPEAKER_03:  protocol for the City of Long Beach, which is \nSPEAKER_03:  the most basic requirements that we needed to meet. \nSPEAKER_03:  And when this was issued, I think on a Wednesday. \nSPEAKER_03:  by Oron on Monday by Wednesday we had everything in place because we were already \nSPEAKER_03:  probably three-quarters of the way there. \nSPEAKER_03:  I will say for me personally. \nSPEAKER_03:  There are two non-negotiable items when our team members come back to work. \nSPEAKER_03:  One is they must wear a face mask. \nSPEAKER_03:  The second one is they must maintain six feet of social distancing. \nSPEAKER_03:  non-negotiable. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that's what I would. \nSPEAKER_03:  ask them to \nSPEAKER_03:  to really help pitch in and we know it's going to be a learning experience because it's not natural. \nSPEAKER_03:  at all. So \nSPEAKER_03:  I should be wearing a face mask right now, but \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sparing you guys because I'm in a room by myself. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  We're really taking a phased approach. We're between phase two and phase three right now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next week, all of the Toyota plants will begin full vehicle production. So we will be supporting our customers to that effort. \nSPEAKER_03:  and our guiding principles. \nSPEAKER_03:  really promoting a safe workplace. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  adjusting production operations and caring for our team members. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in terms of promoting a safe workplace, really, we're looking at team member personal sanitization. \nSPEAKER_03:  how we're keeping the processes sanitized and how we're keeping the common areas sanitized within the plant. \nSPEAKER_03:  The biggest challenge really is the last bullet point, which is securing adequate supply chain of \nSPEAKER_03:  sanitizing product. \nSPEAKER_03:  And \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, being able to make sure we can keep up with it. \nSPEAKER_03:  All of our team members will go through a reentry. \nSPEAKER_03:  process. \nSPEAKER_03:  First of all, we are asking exposure questions. Those have all actually been answered already. \nSPEAKER_03:  via iTunes or whatever. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, personal devices the team members have. \nSPEAKER_03:  We will do temperature checks. We'll provide. \nSPEAKER_03:  All of the PPE that's required to hand sanitizers, the masks, etc. for all of our team members. \nSPEAKER_03:  are adjusting all of our common areas to make sure that social distancing markings are on the floor. We've got partitions in our washrooms, breakrooms, separation and \nSPEAKER_03:  the seating areas, etc. \nSPEAKER_03:  to really promote the social distancing. \nSPEAKER_03:  in our administrative areas the same types of things are going on. \nSPEAKER_03:  some more examples of \nSPEAKER_03:  What we're doing in our administrative areas. \nSPEAKER_03:  any of the production area. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, we have a lot of... \nSPEAKER_03:  team member communications that take place, team member meetings. \nSPEAKER_03:  All of those will now have to take place with these social distancing in mind. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're doing things like turning off our fans. \nSPEAKER_03:  very controversial item as we move into summertime to keep from blowing any virus. \nSPEAKER_03:  from team member to team member. \nSPEAKER_03:  And again, some more examples of what we're doing on our shop floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  other examples again just pictures here of what's going on with the shops. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we have team rooms. We're doing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Very similar things here. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's slide. I'm going to stop on just for a minute. \nSPEAKER_03:  And this has to do with \nSPEAKER_03:  ensuring open lines of communication with our team members. \nSPEAKER_03:  During our eight-week shutdown, all of our group leaders were required to speak to every team member at least once a week. \nSPEAKER_03:  That means call them up at home, talk to them, ask them how they're doing, how's their family doing. \nSPEAKER_03:  We had communications going out through an app that we have our team members signed up for. \nSPEAKER_03:  It had things that are happening at the plant, what we're doing in the community, et cetera. \nSPEAKER_03:  Weekly we have videos from our plant president who's on the line Mike Truax. Thank you Mike for joining today. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  And periodically letters that went out, we had video messages from our leadership in North America. \nSPEAKER_03:  etc. So a lot of touch points. \nSPEAKER_03:  We do have an onsite medical. \nSPEAKER_03:  area I won't call it a clinic. We have an offsite clinic but we do have nurses. \nSPEAKER_03:  on site during \nSPEAKER_03:  very business hours. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then our goal really is to return. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Get the team members back to work safely and get them back to home safely. That's our goal. \nSPEAKER_03:  through this whole effort. \nSPEAKER_03:  Some special accommodations we've made. We do provide paid leave. \nSPEAKER_03:  for anybody that is COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_03:  self-isolated or sick. \nSPEAKER_03:  We do provide temporary leave in accommodation for team members returning to work. \nSPEAKER_03:  that don't have childcare or have a high risk team member or family member at home that they need to take care of. \nSPEAKER_03:  We are providing, we've provided, I basically worked from home for four weeks. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's amazing how much you can actually get done \nSPEAKER_03:  when you're not being interrupted. \nSPEAKER_03:  We will continue some of that and then basically travel has been frozen. \nSPEAKER_03:  Nobody, what things that we've learned like with teams and \nSPEAKER_03:  WebEx and those types of ways of communicating. \nSPEAKER_03:  Honestly, I think travel is going to become \nSPEAKER_03:  a thing of the past for a lot of different people. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  That really concludes it. Sorry if I went over a little bit. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm already back to work. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you so much, Jim, for your presentation. I'm always excited to hear updates from TADC. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it's great to know that you're taking such great links and precautions. \nSPEAKER_05:  to prioritize safety of \nSPEAKER_05:  your employees. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we look for it's a lot of great activity happening over on your corridor on Paramount Boulevard, so. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're great to have you there, anchoring that corridor. And thank you for those comments. \nSPEAKER_05:  John, you want to introduce Mr. Amos? \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sorry, Rebecca. \nSPEAKER_03:  By the way, \nSPEAKER_03:  anytime you or councilman or any anybody wants to come by. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're more than welcome. \nSPEAKER_05:  Absolutely. Thank you for that. I've been your site quite a \nSPEAKER_05:  I think maybe we grab the committee and take them all to see what. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, \nSPEAKER_05:  The only Toyota \nSPEAKER_05:  manufacturer on the west coast is in Long Beach, North Long Beach at that. So we're really \nSPEAKER_05:  out to having Bravo \nSPEAKER_03:  Bring your face masks and stay six feet apart. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, we will. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, John. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Fantastic. Alright, well, without further ado, I will actually ask we same aside from closed blue. \nSPEAKER_04:  Classics to talk a little bit about what they're doing the impacts of COVID-19 and how we can get our manufacturing small manufacturers back to business. \nSPEAKER_04:  Take it away Bruce. \nSPEAKER_05:  Hey, Bruce, your muted buddy. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  There you go. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't know what I'd do without you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're seeing you there. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're seeing. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks, thanks for having me. \nSPEAKER_02:  My name is Bruce Amos. I'm an investor and advisor for closed-loop plastics. \nSPEAKER_02:  in the startup world and on what's known as a gray beard. \nSPEAKER_02:  The company is actually made up of three. \nSPEAKER_02:  very young people who've just graduated a few years ago from \nSPEAKER_02:  You see a rewind? \nSPEAKER_02:  We're now located in Long Beach and we're very, very excited about being here, but just a little bit about how we got here. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  The three founders, two of them are environment engineers, one's a computer engineer. \nSPEAKER_02:  And they started working with 3D printing. \nSPEAKER_02:  probably in their sophomore year and they were astounded by how much waste 3d printing generated and they decided they wanted to do something about that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So they created a project at the university where they built a cart with a 3D printer on it. \nSPEAKER_02:  And a hand grinder and they would take all the waste from these 3d modeling and grind them up and turn them right back into filament that would go right back onto the 3d printer. \nSPEAKER_02:  which was powered by a bicycle, stationary bicycle was operated by one of them. \nSPEAKER_02:  members of the team and so they proved the concept. \nSPEAKER_02:  Taking the system completely off the loop now. \nSPEAKER_02:  didn't require any power from the wall, didn't create any waste. \nSPEAKER_02:  And they \nSPEAKER_02:  Decided when the graduate had been wanted to keep that project going. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in 2018, they took some shared \nSPEAKER_02:  warehouse space. \nSPEAKER_02:  in downtown LA and \nSPEAKER_02:  rated a bench top. \nSPEAKER_02:  Took some red solo cops we want they wanted to pick one of the worst. \nSPEAKER_02:  types of plastic that there is to work with and red silica cups are hated. \nSPEAKER_02:  in the recycling industry. \nSPEAKER_02:  known as HEP, Sion Pack, Polly Styrane. \nSPEAKER_02:  No one in recycling likes it. \nSPEAKER_02:  They don't want to work with it. \nSPEAKER_02:  So they picked that because it was so. \nSPEAKER_02:  Horrible. \nSPEAKER_02:  and turned it into \nSPEAKER_02:  uh, filament for 3D printing. So they took a 100% OS consumer product. \nSPEAKER_02:  cleaned it up and turned it into an engineering grade feedstock. \nSPEAKER_02:  for additive manufacturing or 3D printing. \nSPEAKER_02:  They were successful at doing that by the end of 2018. They tested it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Even so, some of it. \nSPEAKER_02:  But then Will came to me and he said, well dad. \nSPEAKER_02:  This has been great, but now we need a pilot facility and I think, well, what's that gonna cost? \nSPEAKER_02:  and he told me \nSPEAKER_02:  And I swallowed hard and said, OK, well, we just have to do it. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we were lucky enough to find warehouse space in Long Beach in 2019. \nSPEAKER_02:  in the spring. \nSPEAKER_02:  And by the by December of 2019 we \nSPEAKER_02:  We're set to go. We were. \nSPEAKER_02:  making plastic. \nSPEAKER_02:  And in the spring of this year, we were just really ready to get going. I've been working with Saeed. \nSPEAKER_02:  fantastic work from economic development folks. \nSPEAKER_02:  We were talking to Lucius Martin, a Pacific Gateway workforce. We were going to get some help in there. \nSPEAKER_02:  and really get things cranking up. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then March came and we stopped. \nSPEAKER_02:  The good news is though the boys just pivoted immediately and started making these. This is a headband. \nSPEAKER_02:  or PPE you just wrap. \nSPEAKER_02:  piece of plastic along the front of that. \nSPEAKER_02:  put that on and you've got a face shield. So they began making these immediately. \nSPEAKER_02:  It went home. \nSPEAKER_02:  and working from home that we're producing. \nSPEAKER_02:  hundreds of these a week which were distributed to hospitals. \nSPEAKER_02:  in Long Beach and in Los Angeles. \nSPEAKER_02:  They just picked right up and kept going. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  We are now back at our facility in Long Beach. We're very excited to be back. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're going to start making filament again. \nSPEAKER_02:  Because all of these, this device right here that's made from 100%. \nSPEAKER_02:  I was going to see work elements. So that's. \nSPEAKER_02:  Nobody had to produce an urgent film and to make this product. \nSPEAKER_02:  Our goal is to take a big bite out of the plastic waste. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's all over the place. And so say, Ignia, as we continue. \nSPEAKER_02:  are working together, hoping to put together a demonstration plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  that can show how \nSPEAKER_02:  We can take all of the plastic and turn it into engineering grade. \nSPEAKER_02:  feedstock. We're \nSPEAKER_02:  back to talking with. \nSPEAKER_02:  Delicious at the Pacific Gateway workforce. We're going to get some more people in our facility. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're going to get geared up. We're excited. We're ready to go. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Fantastic. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  enjoyed, we enjoyed very much working in Long Beach and \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  uh \nSPEAKER_02:  Sayed and his team and Lucius and his team have been \nSPEAKER_02:  We're a very small family on companies. So we've been... \nSPEAKER_02:  We've been well taken care of. Thank you all. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, Mr. James, I just want to say thanks for \nSPEAKER_05:  selecting on beach to oboe. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I have to tell you, I'm heartening here that you figured out how to \nSPEAKER_05:  contribute to the effort by. \nSPEAKER_05:  figuring out how to manufacture these face shields in a sustainable way. \nSPEAKER_05:  So thank you for that. I want to hand it to before we take the motion of receiving file, this one, and it's the Councilman Eurenga. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you have any comments or thoughts. \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, this is what a great business. We're looking especially at China. \nSPEAKER_00:  refusing a lot of our recycling products, especially plastic. \nSPEAKER_00:  And as many of you may know, I also sit on the California Coastal Commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  and blessed. \nSPEAKER_00:  polluting our oceans is huge. \nSPEAKER_00:  So thank you for that work. And you guys are doing wonderful. Continue success. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, sir. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So Jim Bruce, we appreciate both of you Mr. Lorraine, Council Mayor, you want to make a motion or see the fire? \nSPEAKER_05:  move to receive a file. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you all second. Was that a roll call vote please? \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll remember you, Ranga. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice-chair mango. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair Richardson."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Now we're going to move to our arts. \nSPEAKER_02:  conversation can be here item number five please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, item five is a recommendation to receive and file an update from the arts council regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on the creative sector. \nSPEAKER_02:  fantastic. So we have a privilege of being joined. \nSPEAKER_02:  by our Arts Council for Long Beach. We have our executive director, Griselda Suarez here, who's just a tremendous champion of Long Beach. And she reached out and was adamant that the arts are part of the reopening conversation and that we have a full understanding of the impact of the arts on Long Beach. Griselda, we're happy to have you. You have the floor. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much, Chair Richardson for the invitation and Council Member O'Ranga. Thank you for. \nSPEAKER_01:  taking this report as well on behalf of \nSPEAKER_01:  the staff and board and our grantees and our partners. I am \nSPEAKER_01:  So grateful to be able to share this information with you. \nSPEAKER_01:  tonight. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just wanted to give an overview of how much the city of Long Beach already invests in arts and culture for our entire, for our visitors and our residents. As you can see here, there are several layers. There's a contract to the Arts Council. There's our own Arts Council fund raising contributions to the Museum of Art, the Long Beach Museum of Arts, and also the percent for arts policy that we passed with all your support two years ago. \nSPEAKER_01:  So all in all, there's a $1.5 million investment from the city to provide art services and grant funding and event and promotion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now, all of this translates with all of our grantees and partners into a really large creative economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  21 million dollars comes from the creative economy here in Long Beach, the arts and culture sector. These are cultural workers who are making all of this possible. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, close to a million people in an audience. We engage close to 200,000 students in the classrooms or in field trips or or community programs. And so when we're looking at the impact of COVID onto the arts and culture sector, the first thing that happened was we closed events. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that community aspect, that human aspect of connecting after work, connecting before work. And so it definitely hid our grantees. \nSPEAKER_01:  big time, but it also. \nSPEAKER_01:  hits the local revenue for our government with this economic impact on an annual basis. The creative sector contributes $2 million to local revenue, $2.9 million to the state out of Long Beach. And the average person spends about $27 on top of the ticket for the theater, for musical theater, West, or the symphony, or any sort of event that we have in the Long Beach area. \nSPEAKER_01:  and not providing any class instruction also impacts our students. So we are looking at a large deficit of \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  of the economic side but also the social and cultural side. And that is something that is difficult. \nSPEAKER_01:  for us as you move forward. Now, we partnered with the nonprofit partnership to figure out what the loss is currently for many of our grantees. I try to fit as many of them on here on the slide. Forgive me if I forgot some of them. But we have grantees that work with veterans. We have grantees that work in the schools. We have grantees that work in the schools. \nSPEAKER_01:  that work with people with different disabilities. And so, \nSPEAKER_01:  The medium loss of revenue would be from fundraising across the state as $135,000 per non-profits. \nSPEAKER_01:  here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, organizations are looking or are reporting the loss of more close to five million dollars from the Council of Fundraising and Contributions and campaigns. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so on top of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, you know, the museum sector is really impacted. Um, in California, there are 1500 museums. \nSPEAKER_01:  In Long Beach, there are eight. And so I'm looking forward to, as we move forward in these stages, to have museums and galleries open up soon. But they're going to be restricted on how many people can come in. So that impacts revenue as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So there's definitely something that's going to hurt us here. And so we're looking at the majority of, as you know, the next. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  You'll see here. You'll see. \nSPEAKER_01:  probably 88% of the revenue from tickets and or visits lost. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the next few months, right? So it's becoming harder and harder as we stay close, even though we understand this is all about \nSPEAKER_01:  public safety. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  We were glad to. \nSPEAKER_01:  have some projects in collaboration with the city in response to the pandemic. We have the Keeparts Working Project. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are working with organizational grantees on what their reopening plans look like and providing recommendations not only for the city, for the county to use. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're part of the restart Long Beach economy recovery advisory. We're working not only the arts council, but many of our grantees are involved in county and national subject planning in order to really \nSPEAKER_01:  see what we can do here and innovate how we approach audiences when we do reopen. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  We're glad to be partnering with the Office of Economic Development when we partnered with many businesses to create murals on their boards. I understand that businesses were worried about their storefronts as we all shut down. And so it was an amazing project. We had inspiring and uplifting artwork come up on many business storefronts. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the Arts Council also created the COVID Response Fund for artists. We are trying to pay as many artists to uplift our lives right now, but if they can't produce, if something else they get sick, we have started to fund. And \nSPEAKER_01:  It was all private donors and just in a day in announcing that we started the Chloro Response Fund. We're now up to over $40,000 that we're going to give out to artists for basic needs that they cannot meet at this time. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will share a video here. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can't show the video. I can't press on the play button, unfortunately. But Q Films is an example of a grantee that's working towards providing their festival in September through \nSPEAKER_01:  working with another one of our grantees, the art theater, and seeing how they could readjust. \nSPEAKER_01:  what it looks like to go to the theater, but also seeing how they can stream their films online. \nSPEAKER_01:  And also see maybe parks or drive-ins for films. We're trying to be very creative here in order for the center to be able to provide the film festival, which is the longest running film festival in Lombi. \nSPEAKER_00:  Wow. \nSPEAKER_01:  And it brings up, it actually is a major contribution to revenue. That's what the arts do. We have tickets. We invite people to enjoy the art forms. And so this is definitely a loss. But they're working hard to make sure that it's accessible. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we still provide free tickets and there's still some access to the films in some way shape or form. \nSPEAKER_01:  On this slide, I talked about 88% of fundraising dollars being lost because of these closures. But when the TNP took the survey, we hadn't known yet how many of our grantees would get PPP loans. And in the organizational grantee level, all of them received PPP loans. And so we're very grateful for our local banks that supported our art non-profits through that. And so there is some support coming in. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  And so moving forward, I... \nSPEAKER_01:  I really urge the city to continue funding arts services and grants because the arts are a unique we have the unique capacity to support the creative economy but also the US economy. We uplift the human spirit. We provide life long-learning, measure B passed this spring and it was a wonderful victory and with the pandemic hitting we as everyone knows we lost a revenue of hotel bed tax right and so that impacts many of our grantees as well but we look forward to the day when measure B can come back and support these organizations but the arts are part of delivering services products creativity to our other devastated economies the restaurant economy travel tourism. People want to see and experience beautiful things active things engaging things so we're trying to be as creative as possible and how to make that to make that a reality in our new normal. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, lastly. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are here to create partnerships and collaborations to see how we can get our arts nonprofits access to PPP, access to resources that they need to implement CDC protocols in order to maintain public health. It's wonderful to hear what Toyota is doing. We need to do the same in our performing arts center. We need to do the same in our museums and our galleries in our Carperture Center, you know, Beverly O'Neill. And so we're working on those, but we need the support of the city and private partners to make that possible. These organizations can serve close to a million people, but all our staffs are really tiny in at capacity. \nSPEAKER_01:  And something that we're talking about at the national level is the CDBG or the Community Development Barrier. Maybe being a way to generate creative solutions to these problems and also support health and well-being of our residents. We think this is an opportune time to combine the creativity of artists with the community development. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to say thank you, muchas gracias for having me here today. And there are three words that we, as the arts council really looked towards when this happened to us, we looked at two, two the words illuminate, alleviate, and recuperate. We know that these dark times, the arts are what are illuminating and bringing light to our lives. We started doing online programming, so it doesn't have grantees. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  We also \nSPEAKER_01:  knew that arts will alleviate the stress. We've been releasing illustrations of our essential workers every single week. \nSPEAKER_01:  since the beginning of April, last week released illustrations of our nurses, of our clerks. And these are activities that families can do together that people can use to destroy color, colorful heroes is the project. \nSPEAKER_01:  and recuperate. This is a time where we know that artists are part of \nSPEAKER_01:  rebuilding lives. So many essential workers right now are the ones who are saving our lives and we want to be partners in rebuilding the lives of our new world together. So thank you again for having me. I really do appreciate the time. \nSPEAKER_02:  Absolutely. I'm going to reserve my comments on Allow Councilor Nguyen Rang to weigh in first Councilman. \nSPEAKER_01:  just one quick question. What does that all mean? \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll admit to you all, therefore, I know it's not one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, thank you, Council Member, you saw my name there, right? Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, my name on the web ex. I don't know where it picked up my my private email \nSPEAKER_01:  But that is the God and goddess of duality, the native concept of wholesomeness and bringing everyone together. \nSPEAKER_01:  or to reach enlightenment. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Definitely. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll just, and I think your presentation was incredible. \nSPEAKER_02:  I love that it quantified the economic impact. \nSPEAKER_02:  I also love that you have tangible recommendations for the City Council. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so I think you're spot on about CDBG. We've had conversations about how we can... \nSPEAKER_02:  a concept we were formed in the use of CDBG. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's going to be more important than ever these. \nSPEAKER_02:  federal sources of funding as we head into this. \nSPEAKER_02:  difficult. \nSPEAKER_02:  a physical period of time. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we will make sure that your comments are reflected in the overall report. And I'll carry them with me myself. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  Council Member, I'll entertain a motion to receive a file, the report. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll continue to file the report. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you all second. \nSPEAKER_02:  I was going ahead to roll call vote please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember Uraenga. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice-chairman Go. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I am I."
