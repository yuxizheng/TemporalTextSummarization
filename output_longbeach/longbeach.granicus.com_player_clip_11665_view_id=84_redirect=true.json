        "transcript": "SPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Second item on the agenda is a recommendation to receive and file the presentation by City Auditor Laura Dow regarding the ethics program performance audit and I want to welcome the city auditor, Lord Dow to our meeting and the people that she's brought with. \nSPEAKER_08:  her and thanks to her and the city manager and the city attorney. \nSPEAKER_08:  for getting this. \nSPEAKER_08:  report. \nSPEAKER_08:  finished and out to us. \nSPEAKER_08:  so that we could \nSPEAKER_08:  start to start to talk about it. It's important work and I know there's been a lot of other things the cities had to tend to in the last \nSPEAKER_08:  six months. So \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  on and about please. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we appreciate your time. We're grateful to have the audit report available to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  a couple of weeks ago and hopefully you had time to get over briefly and we're grateful to have our consultant. \nSPEAKER_01:  here, Fred Brusso from Harvey Rose to go over a high level of the findings and issues of the ethics audit that we contracted him and his firm to do for us. \nSPEAKER_01:  just as a quick background after the voters approved the ethics commission are also listed in bark on two pieces of this ethics audit one was the survey. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the second piece was this ethics performance audit. And our goal was to try to gain a better understanding of the ethical culture and climate within the city of Long Beach. What policies and procedures were in place? What type of training did they have? What type of oversight? \nSPEAKER_01:  and also to do a comparison of Long Beach with other cities. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're pleased that \nSPEAKER_01:  that Fred and his firm were able to identify 11 basic standards. \nSPEAKER_01:  high level standards and how long-beach messed up and how we can do to improve. \nSPEAKER_01:  ethics throughout throughout the city and what role the fix commission could play in the future for for the regarding ethics and and the reporting mechanism specifically so \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  you know. \nSPEAKER_01:  We. \nSPEAKER_01:  We were initially going to talk about our, our fraud hotline today too, but we will. \nSPEAKER_01:  post-polling that for another meeting when we have a little more time to get into it. But when I took office, I did read our fraud hotline so that employees have an avenue and independent. \nSPEAKER_01:  mechanism to report fraud waste and abuse throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  We receive about 55 calls per year. We do follow up on each tip that we receive. But it is a mechanism for businesses, for vendors, for citizens, for employees. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  to call to report any \nSPEAKER_01:  any alleged or seen or witnessed fraud that they've experienced. So we do follow up on all of this. We do have an annual report. And I'm happy to come back and report on that fraud hotline the next time we meet. \nSPEAKER_01:  For now, I will turn the time over to Fred to go over the highlights of them. \nSPEAKER_01:  the audit, the Heuperform and \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the highlights from which she \nSPEAKER_01:  I think he has a PowerPoint presentation here. So I'll turn the time over now to Fred. Thank you, Fred. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, City Auditor Dowd. \nSPEAKER_09:  and chairwise and members of the commission and Fred Berrso and the principal with Harvey Rose Associates who was the principal in charge of this performance audit. \nSPEAKER_09:  of the cities. \nSPEAKER_09:  ethics program. \nSPEAKER_09:  And just so I know the slides up now can everybody see them. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm seeing them on my screen just want to make sure. \nSPEAKER_07:  I can see them and can we get a copy of the presentation at some point. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, I did send one to JT and I think I believe he can distribute it. I could certainly extend it on to the city auditor as well. Yeah, you should have received it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, you should have received an email. I believe it was last night with the PowerPoint included in it. \nSPEAKER_07:  Did everyone else get that email? \nSPEAKER_06:  I didn't either, but I would look forward to seeing it. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. Yeah, I don't think so. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  but I can see Fred, your presentation. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, well with that I'll go ahead. So first of all just a couple of themes from the audit, and you'll hear, is that getting to the detail of these themes. \nSPEAKER_09:  being repeated. \nSPEAKER_09:  First of all, there are many elements in place in the city for a good ethics program and what one would hope to find in an ethics program. But what we found lacking in the general senses. \nSPEAKER_09:  Central oversight and accountability for the program. So there are many actors, many city departments involved in it, but no central focal point for overseeing it and making sure it's effective. \nSPEAKER_09:  Second, some areas of the program are well documented. \nSPEAKER_09:  others, I'm not so well documented and I'll get into more of those details as I go through. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then finally, we had the good luck to have a, there was a survey going on of city employees at the same time as we were doing our audit. It was an ethics culture survey. \nSPEAKER_09:  So we had the advantage of seeing the results of that when we completed our audit. And we've incorporated some of those. \nSPEAKER_09:  findings and a general one is an employee awareness of the city's ethics program is low only 55% of the \nSPEAKER_09:  surveyed employees were aware of the program and they also reported headed back on reporting suspected ethical misconduct. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's a problem in the sense of, you know, that's really going to be your primary source of finding out if ethics. \nSPEAKER_09:  Code and ethics issues are being violated in the city or not is hearing it from \nSPEAKER_09:  Employees reporting it so you want those systems to be effective and for employees to feel confident doing it. \nSPEAKER_09:  Anyway, if we could move on to the next slide. \nSPEAKER_09:  There we go. So quickly, definition of ethics, what are we talking about? You're the ethics commission, so I'm probably not needing to tell anyone here this, but this is what we use is our \nSPEAKER_09:  definition. It's a system of moral principles that define good and bad and what is expected of a group. \nSPEAKER_09:  and a municipality in your case. \nSPEAKER_09:  To have an ethics program, it should clearly set forth whether it's right and wrong for elected officials. \nSPEAKER_09:  Pointed commissioners and committee members, employees, interns, volunteers. \nSPEAKER_09:  Contractors and vendors. \nSPEAKER_09:  And for the program to be effective, it must be clearly communicated to all staff. \nSPEAKER_09:  and officials and demonstrators are really supported by executive management. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So this is just a quick overview of the existing city ethics program when we. \nSPEAKER_09:  conducted this audit and by the way the ethics commission didn't exist at that time but while we were doing our work the 2018 election took place and measure CC pass so as we were finalizing it your body was being organized which is why you don't see it on this chart we're going to talk a lot about the ethics commission and the recommendations. \nSPEAKER_09:  So the three key agencies are the city attorney, the human resources department and the city on the Truze Office of course. \nSPEAKER_09:  They compile and act on the laws and program requirements that are in place. \nSPEAKER_09:  but each in different areas. And that's one of the problems of getting back to this theme of kind of central management and accountability is there's, you know, there's three different components going on, but it's not centrally overseen and managed. In terms of program administration, the departments are the city clerk. The city clerk's role is administering the mechanisms for financial disclosure, gift disclosure, lobbying requirements, that type of thing. \nSPEAKER_09:  the city clerk maintains those records and posts some of them or reports some to the state fair political practices commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  The city manager has oversight over a number of city departments, but not all and in that regard. \nSPEAKER_09:  that office has policies and procedures in place in areas such as employee travel or gifts that are tickets that are received as gifts. So there are procedures in place to oversee ethical behavior in departments overseeing by the city manager. But then you have many departments in the city that are not overseeing by the city manager, all the enterprise departments such as the port and those headed by elected officials. So they don't fall necessarily under \nSPEAKER_09:  the rules and procedures administered by the city manager. \nSPEAKER_09:  they may have their own. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  Key ethics program documents that we reviewed, there's the ethics guide for Long Beach City staff and officials. This is compiled by the City Attorney's Office and contains the topics that you see here. These are, you know, sort of what you might expect kind of standard ethics issues in the municipality, accepting gifts, the financial disclosure requirements, lobbying, restrictions, and regulation, brown act, \nSPEAKER_09:  and the others listed here. But beyond that, we define the ethics program more holistically, and we include anti-discrimination and harassment policies, for example. Those are under the jurisdiction of the \nSPEAKER_09:  human resources department and the equal opportunity office and they prepare the policies and update those and so forth separate from the ethics guide prepared by the city attorney. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then finally, the city auditor has internal fraud, hotline policies and procedures for fraud, waste and abuse. \nSPEAKER_09:  So there's documentation there as well, but it's for areas that the city auditor investigates. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So we identified 11 standards and so the auditor, Deb mentioned those in her opening remarks. These were from a variety of sources, including the Ethics Cultural Institute, which conducted the survey. There's an Institute of International Auditors that has a framework in standards for ethical behavior and some federal agencies, including the Department of Justice. And they have a set of guidelines for ethical practices and public agencies. So we used all of those to identify these 11 standards and then use those to measure the ethics program, the City of Long Beach, in our audit. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide please. So I'll briefly go through each one in our report. There are write-ups of each one and then more detailed about what we found in other cities because we surveyed 10 other cities for comparison with how their ethics program function compared to Long Beach. We also surveyed cities and apartments. \nSPEAKER_09:  and got information from each city department. And then some of the elected bodies as well, the City Council, for example, and the Planning Commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then finally, we use the employee survey, which I mentioned. So here, the first standard is to have established oversight and clear delegation of responsibilities. And again, I think I alluded to this already, but many of the program elements are in place in the city. But no one entity is providing management oversight. Or is it countable for ensuring that the ethics program is running effectively and efficiently? \nSPEAKER_09:  We found inconsistency in how the program is administered in different city departments. \nSPEAKER_09:  But again, the timing was great for this audit because of the establishment of your commission. So here we really see an opportunity to centralize a lot of oversight and accountability. And those are our recommendations related to the standard is that the mayor and the city council identify the areas that should be jurisdiction of the ethics commission and how information is going to be reported, citywide, compiled and presented to your commission. But also to the public so that there is complete disclosure every year, say, on how well the program is doing, where problems have occurred, where improvements have been made and other sort of management measures. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  We also recommend creation of a centralized document, as I mentioned, there are different documents now, three key ones. \nSPEAKER_09:  dealing with the ethics program, but no one central source where an employee, remembered the public, an elected official could go to get the full set of regulations and procedures. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard two is having easily accessible comprehensive written ethics policies and procedures. Related, spoke to this already under the last standard. But here's more detail in this particular finding about what should be made available. And again, one consolidated document and or website or both. And our recommendation is that that should be something that the ethics commission maintains, compiles, and updates, at least on an annual basis, and makes available on your website for the public and employees. The city survey results in this regard, only 27% of the respondents. And there were about, I think, 1,450 respondents. We're aware of all program elements of the ethics program. \nSPEAKER_09:  And only 22% had a positive assessment of program resources. So when I talk about these written documents, procedures, and so forth, that they aren't perceived positively by the majority of city employees. \nSPEAKER_09:  Many of the cities that we survey do have comprehensive ethics program websites with documentation of the different elements of the program, how when files are complaint, what the results were from complaints filed in prior years. That's the type of information detailed in our report that we think should be compiled and produced yearly by the by your commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide, please. So standard three policies and procedures outlining the ethics program in the city's municipal code. Right now there is only one real reference To ethics in the city's municipal code and that's the code of ethics. It's a high level series of \nSPEAKER_09:  behaviors that are encouraged by the city such as treating each other respectfully, not treating other employees unfairly, that type of thing, which is all fine, but we think it should go further and we found this in other cities where the municipal code has more details and is really a key source. You don't need all the nitty gritty of \nSPEAKER_09:  of every procedure and every form and so forth. But so every element of the ethics program is identified in an official city source. And someone could go to it and say, this is the municipal code. We have this ethics program here. It is identified. \nSPEAKER_09:  If I'm an employee or an elected official and are appointed official, I don't have to scramble around and try to find it in different places and wonder if I have The official document or not. It's in the municipal code. It gives the certain stature and level of authority so people can be comfortable knowing they're seeing the Um \nSPEAKER_09:  the full picture and then if they need more details it would refer them on to a particular department. \nSPEAKER_09:  We have the next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard number four, a starting point for all of this is a clear definition of ethics. What does that actually include in the city? I think everyone probably has some sense of what ethics means and we could go around and everyone could say what they think it is. There probably be a lot of similarities, but there might be some differences too. Or one person might leave something out and another person might add something. So, \nSPEAKER_09:  We recommend that there be a clear definition established, again, something to put in the municipal code, and uses the foundation for the programs, procedures, and processes that are then put in place. We do recommend that it be broader than we know that, for example, conflict of interest and lobbying are typical parts of ethics program. I think that's fine and good to include. But we also recommend including sexual harassment and discrimination elements, so that that's clearly part of the definition and that employees are, \nSPEAKER_09:  informed that that is. \nSPEAKER_09:  expected in their behavior that there won't be discriminatory behavior or they won't be harassing other employees or employees that they supervise in particular. \nSPEAKER_09:  And we have some points here. \nSPEAKER_09:  that we believe should be included in considering the definition, such as accountability and transparency into the operations, inclusivity, respect for employees and citizens. \nSPEAKER_09:  And as I mentioned, prohibition of discrimination and sexual harassment. \nSPEAKER_09:  Could you go to the next slide, please? \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard number five is having clearly identified pathways to report alleged violations non-namesly or not. And this could be for employees, this could be for elected and appointed officials, also for members of the public, citizens of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_09:  who perhaps see something that they believe should be reported. \nSPEAKER_09:  Right now the city provides multiple pathways you can. \nSPEAKER_09:  report suspected ethical misconduct. \nSPEAKER_09:  to supervisors in your department. If you're an employee, you could go to the city auditors, a fraud waste and abuse hotline. You can contact the city attorney's office or you can go to the human resources department if it's a case of discrimination or sexual harassment. So that's all good that there are different sources. The problem that we found is those pathways aren't documented in any one source. And if someone was trying to find out all the ways that they could approach a report, a suspected misconduct, there's really no place where you can see the list of how you could approach it. And why that's valuable is employees, a member of the public may have different comfort levels with how they're going to report. Going to one supervisor, \nSPEAKER_09:  might be great in many cases. On the other hand, the supervisor might be the problem or the employee may have misgivings about some retaliation if they bring something up about someone in the management of their department and so forth. So again, the different pathways are great. The city auditor's hotline is confidential. I think all these sources would be confidential ultimately. But letting employees know and the public know how they can go about it is extremely important in something that should be in this centralized document that we recommend. \nSPEAKER_09:  Most departments we found in our survey don't have any written policies and procedures about how to deal with ethics related issues in their department. So there are administrative officers, for example, in every department that are supposed to receive complaints if a employee wants to file a complaint suspected misconduct. But we didn't find any written source that said every department has an administrative officer. \nSPEAKER_09:  that is available for that purpose. So it's commonly understood, perhaps, but maybe not by everybody. And that's why it needs to be written down in a centralized place. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  In the 2019 City Employee Survey, only 55% of those that had suspected misconduct was occurring actually reported it. And in their explanations for reluctance to report, they included believing their complaints would not remain anonymous, fear of retaliation, and not knowing whom to contact. So I think these are all really good support for the idea of making these pathways extremely clear and letting employees know that it is a safe way to make the reports. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard six is advice and information on ethics related issue and sort of issues like what I was talking about Many of the go there isn't a Central source where employees or remember the publics can go to get advice and information on ethics issues \nSPEAKER_09:  So we think this is important to you may not even, as mentioned in the city survey results, employees don't necessarily know if what they're suspecting is ethical misconduct is ethical misconduct or not. And having someone they can run these ideas by would be extremely helpful and helped and determine if they should proceed with filing a report or not. And again, I just want to emphasize how important it is for the ethics program to have employees report what they're seeing because that is your best source of information on ethical misconduct. They're seeing what's going on every day in city operations and where there might be problems. \nSPEAKER_09:  And even if they're wrong, you know, the... \nSPEAKER_09:  The ideal situation is there's more reports than actual \nSPEAKER_09:  findings of misconduct, but it's a good sign when you have employees reporting that they think is misconduct. \nSPEAKER_09:  and having advice on. \nSPEAKER_09:  on these issues is a great starting point. So making a hotline or phone line available for that purpose and letting employees know how they can do it is extremely important. And we talked about centralizing a lot of functions under the Ethics Commission. And we also said that some staffing will be necessary for that. And in our survey of 10 other cities and they range from cities slightly smaller than Long Beach to larger ones up to the size of Chicago and Los Angeles and something between. But they all have city staff but for one dedicated employees. And it ranged from about \nSPEAKER_09:  If the smallest was maybe three employees up to 28. So there's quite a range. The functions can vary for each of the commissions. But when we talk about these kind of roles and who's going to do this, we do recognize that some staff would be needed to fulfill these functions. \nSPEAKER_09:  If we go to the next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard number seven is establish and publish disciplinary actions and penalties for violations. So again, back to the employee survey here, we found that there was this reluctance to report suspected ethical misconduct. And one reason employee side of the belief that the corrective actions taken were not severe or complete enough. \nSPEAKER_09:  And this goes back to not knowing what the disciplinary procedures or possible repercussions are because they aren't. \nSPEAKER_09:  printed anywhere. You don't find them in the municipal code. You don't find them in the existing ethics documents. \nSPEAKER_09:  So. \nSPEAKER_09:  What we did find in other cities and what we think would be extremely useful is to have that printed. It could be in the municipal code. If, you know, for certain violations, you can be subject to termination or a fines up to a certain dollar amount. And that is not unheard of in other codes. I think it's extremely useful for. \nSPEAKER_09:  employees who are going to report and also for employees who may be engaged in ethical misconduct to know what the repercussions could be that they could lose their job, they could be subject to certain fines. There are some state \nSPEAKER_09:  limitations on that that believes the current. \nSPEAKER_09:  Local fines can't exceed $5,000, but obviously your city attorney can advise you better on that if you pursue this recommendation, but we think it would be extremely useful to make this a clear process because it's it's unclear right now in current information \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard number eight is annual reports of violation and case outcomes. So at present there isn't really a citywide compilation of how many complaints are filed about ethical misconduct and what the results were. So investigations can take place in different departments as I mentioned earlier. Many take place in the department where say it was an employee that filed the complaint. Many are investigated in the department and resolved in the department and there isn't any compilation of how many of those take place on an annual basis. Some are conducted by the city auditor. As we've talked about, some are conducted by the city attorney, human resources, the police department gets involved if there are complaints about, say, you know, police officers behavior. So there are many avenues for investigations to take place. But one of our first questions coming in as the auditors was how many complaints are filed, how many investigations are conducted, conducted, what are the outcomes and that information doesn't exist. So we think particularly with the advent of your commission, this is an opportunity to have staff compile that information, report it to you every year and for you to report it to the public. \nSPEAKER_09:  There are some investigations that are confidential. There are some outcome measures that can't be reported. What we find in other cities is that information such as that or cases such as that can be rolled up into an aggregate so you can get summary information about types of cases and types of outcomes without getting into specifics that might identify an individual. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_09:  the \nSPEAKER_09:  And what's standard here is to have proactive measures and checks for ethics program effectiveness. And I will say this is probably the most difficult standard because the idea of this is, you know, is staff doing something proactive to say try to identify complex the interest or say an elected official. \nSPEAKER_09:  receiving a gift and not reporting it. So these are things that aren't easy to see from the outside. You might see it if you're involved in the transaction or close to the transaction, but searching for this type of thing can be difficult. But what we did find in our Department of City surveys is a number of departments do have practices in place that are proactive. Some, for example, require all employees to attest to their adherence to the cities. \nSPEAKER_09:  ethics code and ethics regulations every year. I thought that was a good practice. It doesn't happen in every department, however. So it's the type of thing where \nSPEAKER_09:  This is good to know, but these practices should be reported centrally and made study-wide practices. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think that commission working with the city manager and other elected officials would be a way of collecting the information and making decisions and providing policy direction for other \nSPEAKER_09:  affirmative action, I mean affirmative steps that could be taken to be proactive about ensuring that the Code of Actus FX is being followed. Also we found that \nSPEAKER_09:  In terms of the city's vendors and contractors, more could be done to be proactive with them, to insert certain language in all city contracts that require your vendors to state that they're adhering to the city's ethics code and regulations, and to state affirmatively that they haven't provided gifts or group of activities to city officials, \nSPEAKER_09:  or employees, but for whom, you know, who are selecting them or considering them for contract services. So we have recommendations about that as well. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  Standard 10 on the next slide. Next slide please is required and regular ethics training for all officials and employees, and this includes ethics and sexual harassment and discrimination training. Ethics training is required for all new staff during onboarding, but then nothing further beyond that. So an employee who's been working for the city for 20 years, essentially, you know, has had no ethics training or updates since they began their employment 20 years prior. So we do recommend that that be updated, that there be some annual requirement to revisit these things, these topics, because a, the law changes over time, and b, it's a good message to the entire workforce to indicate the city management \nSPEAKER_09:  takes these issues seriously and wants to keep reaffirming them. \nSPEAKER_09:  Some departments do require annual training, but again, some do not. Sexual harassment training has been required by the state. They're supervisory employees for years, but as of January of this year it changed, so all employees must now attend an hour of training every two years. So that is underway. What we do recommend about that is that information about attendance be compiled by probably the HR staff and submitted to the Ethics Commission and the Mayor and the City Council and the City Manager for review so you can make sure and have assurances that in fact employees and city officials are taking the training required. And that again could be part of your annual reporting process. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So standard 11 and this was the last standard of the 11 we looked at have to do with retaliation protection. That there are state laws about this as you probably know, protecting employees from reporting their suspected misconduct. \nSPEAKER_09:  And again, we found that employees were reluctant to make such reports and one of the reasons was they feared recaliation. \nSPEAKER_09:  And looking at the core city documents, the municipal code, the ethics guide, we didn't find any reference to retaliation protection. We think that's an important element that should be in the core documents. The city auditor's fraud hotline provides a summary of whistleblower act protection. So that is good, but it doesn't cover all other possible reports that employees or the public might make. So with right next to filing the complaint form or calling the hotline, we believe equally important is the statement of, here are your protections as a employee or member of the public filing complaint. You have protections against retaliation and retaliation. And if you believe retaliation is occurring, here's what you can do to report that. \nSPEAKER_09:  And many cities that we survey do make these protections known in their codes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  The other area we looked at was compliance with state financial disclosure and other ethics requirements. This, as I mentioned earlier, the city clerk's responsibilities. The key issue here though, the city clerk is responsible for reporting financial disclosures, gifts, lobbying, \nSPEAKER_09:  these type of things mandated largely by state law, but the city clerk has no enforcement authority. So what happens if someone doesn't comply? Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_09:  And what we found in looking at some of the records, for example, on the financial disclosure, these are the Form 700s, which I imagine you've probably all filed now as new commissioners or you will in the next year if you haven't. \nSPEAKER_09:  There are a number of \nSPEAKER_09:  of the 1,285 officials and employees required to make these financial disclosures. Hadn't done so as of March 2019. Some filed late, 146, and some had not filed at all at the time of our doing the report. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that amounted to 21.6% of those required to make those filings. \nSPEAKER_09:  which we thought was not a good sign, and there are no repercussions for not filing. When we looked further into it, some had left the city, they were no longer employed or no longer. \nSPEAKER_09:  in their appointed or elected position, but they are still required to file them, even if they have left. \nSPEAKER_09:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_09:  So what we've recommended is that the city \nSPEAKER_09:  consider adopting its own penalties. You know, if you report this to the State Fair Political Practice Commission, they can do an investigation and they might impose a fine. But the probability of that is low. There aren't that many investigators. \nSPEAKER_09:  to serve the entire state of California and the odds of, you know, getting one of your investigations, one of your cases investigated is low, frankly. So imposing your own fines and having your own staff follow up on it would be probably a more effective way of going. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  Gifts in lobbying and this is the next slide here. So we looked at that as well. We also found gifts are very difficult. I'm sorry, we can go back one night. \nSPEAKER_09:  Jump there a little bit. The gifts. \nSPEAKER_09:  Are reported, do we know that everyone's reporting their gifts? This is one of the proactive. \nSPEAKER_09:  ideas that, you know, it's difficult to make that determination. But we do have some recommendations for how staff investigating ethical conduct could. \nSPEAKER_09:  In fact, review activities of, say, city council or appointed officials to see who they're meeting with and if they are registered as lobbyists and if gifts have been disclosed from those type of meetings. So putting some of the pieces together by, for example, looking at the calendars of city council members and the mayor and seeing if that ties to the registered lobbyists if the business being conducted had to do with lobbying for a particular issue. \nSPEAKER_09:  So we have some recommendations to, I think, strengthen that to provide a little more chief to the... \nSPEAKER_09:  to the filing requirements. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then next slide now, the ethics training, and I mentioned that there are requirements. Again, we found a lot of 38 of the 235 city officials required to take ethics training. Hadn't done so as of early 2019. And some of the lack of compliance went back as far as 2015. So these cases need to be followed up on. Again, City Clerk doesn't have that authority, but this is something that the city with the \nSPEAKER_09:  advocacy of the ethics commission could consider, including in its municipal code. So there's more teeth to these. There are some fines or penalties and some staff to follow up on. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  investigating noncompliance. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that is next slide please. That is a summary of the report. We have 25 recommendations in the report. I just gave you highlights. \nSPEAKER_09:  And of course more details on all the findings and if you \nSPEAKER_09:  I hope you have the slides now, but if not, they will. \nSPEAKER_09:  in your inbox, I guess, soon. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I'm happy to respond to any questions or comments. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do have a question in other California cities where the City Ethics Commission gets involved in investigations or advice. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do you know what they're doing relative to the brown act? \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, if there's, for example, corrective actions, we want to be protecting. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  uh uh an informant side identification those kind of things. \nSPEAKER_09:  Right. I know in a general sense that there are definitely confidentiality protections for someone filing a suspected brown act violation and that they do conduct in their investigations into that matter. \nSPEAKER_09:  What the fines or penalties might be for it, I don't know right off hand, but we could look into their codes and see. \nSPEAKER_07:  Or we can talk with our city attorneys office. I'm thinking not just violations of the Brown Act, but if we get involved in if someone calls. \nSPEAKER_07:  If the Ethics Commission gets involved in investigating and someone calls him says, I think that that particular elected official is taking improper gifts. \nSPEAKER_09:  Right, right. \nSPEAKER_07:  I wouldn't want that. \nSPEAKER_07:  publicized. \nSPEAKER_07:  But with the names attached to it, certainly during the investigation, and we certainly would want to protect the informant through even after the investigations concluded. \nSPEAKER_09:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_09:  Absolutely, good point. And I think that the reports we've seen, where it's that type of situation, if they're reported, they're reported in aggregate. So they may say we investigated three brown act violations. Absolutely would not report who filed the complaint. And may or may not report the outcome if it would, \nSPEAKER_09:  provide information that could lead one to the obvious. \nSPEAKER_09:  source. So they may say, you know, and the case was resolved or, you know, finds and been imposed or something, but keeping at a high level, have definitely seen that in certain types of investigations. \nSPEAKER_07:  We'll get with the city attorney first and find out. \nSPEAKER_07:  Ahhh. \nSPEAKER_07:  what their thinking is on how these other cities have done that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Sure. \nSPEAKER_08:  Let me say just first, because the auditor have any comments that she wants to make at this point. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_08:  before the commissioners ask more questions or. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  This doubt I think you're on mute. \nSPEAKER_01:  I mean, now. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I have a quick clarification, so you guys can now hear me. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Everyone can now hear me. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good. All right. Sorry about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to thank Fred for that overview. I think he did a good job of the highlights from the audience. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I think it's important that you all have a copy of this PowerPoint presentation. I have not yet received a copy of the PowerPoint presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  It is sent out if you could see me as well, that would be helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  We did receive it during the call. Okay. I haven't. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  but \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I think that was a really good high level review of the important pieces that you would need to know. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. And I have one question. Will we be able to... \nSPEAKER_08:  We're going to be looking at this document over and over again over the next few months as we figure out what we're going to do. And as we have questions. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  that \nSPEAKER_08:  The Harvey Rose. \nSPEAKER_08:  Office might have answers to. \nSPEAKER_08:  Can we still pose those to them or bring them back or what's \nSPEAKER_08:  What's that? \nSPEAKER_08:  arrangement for them as a resource at this point. \nSPEAKER_01:  Would you be agreeable to writing your questions down? \nSPEAKER_01:  For us. \nSPEAKER_01:  to stand to him. \nSPEAKER_08:  Sure, we can we can do that. We can work those details out, but it sounds like we can still. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  Ask more questions after four o'clock this afternoon, right? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  and we're happy to have a dear response. Excuse me. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we're happy to. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I had a question right along that same line. I was wondering if, because I thought the report was an excellent, if we would have the opportunity maybe for even... \nSPEAKER_00:  We could submit the questions in advance, but maybe a Q&A session with \nSPEAKER_00:  You missed out and Mr. Rose, but that was really more of a question I thought that would pose to. \nSPEAKER_00:  you. \nSPEAKER_00:  missed out. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, yes, I'll be available. Sure. \nSPEAKER_00:  And is it possible possibly have a working session with where Mr. Rose could be available for Q&A or \nSPEAKER_00:  We. \nSPEAKER_09:  even certainly possible. Nice side. Yeah. OK. \nSPEAKER_00:  level. And the next article of the post will remain vid\u00e9o en \nSPEAKER_09:  Just clarification, it's Rousseau, but Rose is the name of the company. And it's not the first time I've been called Harvey Rose, but I'm not my bad. No problem. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right. Do other commissioners have questions or comments that they'd like to ask at this at this time. \nSPEAKER_06:  And none at this time. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  I, in the side. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I had a number of questions that I'll hold off asking. We can save it for the other session. I did want to, I appreciated the opportunity to look at the report. \nSPEAKER_00:  and the ethics. \nSPEAKER_00:  and Stephickson Compliance Institute survey. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I thought it was very well done. \nSPEAKER_00:  the uh... \nSPEAKER_00:  uh \nSPEAKER_00:  And primarily I just wanted to have the opportunity to dive a little bit deeper with some of our questions. But again, we can do that via writing them up at advance and then submitting them and possibly even then having you for a session where you can go over those and any follow up questions we might have. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  Does it make sense for us to have a session? \nSPEAKER_07:  and caught through some of the issues and then \nSPEAKER_07:  put all of our questions together and have the second session with Mr. Bruso and Ms. Dowd. \nSPEAKER_08:  Right. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I think also as a practical matter, we need to think. \nSPEAKER_08:  Now also about some of the things that were said in the management response. \nSPEAKER_08:  because if you'll notice the city manager said over and over again. \nSPEAKER_08:  There are fiscal restraints. \nSPEAKER_08:  and on what can be done. \nSPEAKER_08:  right away. And so I think we need to keep that in mind as a practical matter as we \nSPEAKER_08:  pick out the things that \nSPEAKER_08:  our most important and look for ways to do them that can be done. \nSPEAKER_08:  with physical restraints. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I'll just say I have a goal for us. \nSPEAKER_08:  which is that by. \nSPEAKER_08:  June of next year when the City of Long Beach is planning its budget. \nSPEAKER_08:  that we can propose to them a budget with specific things in it. \nSPEAKER_08:  that we want to have accomplished. \nSPEAKER_08:  that we would like the city budget to fund. \nSPEAKER_08:  that will be far enough along in \nSPEAKER_08:  and developing. \nSPEAKER_08:  What the plan is going to be for this commission and its priorities that it can be translated into \nSPEAKER_08:  a dollar. \nSPEAKER_08:  a dollar request. \nSPEAKER_08:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_08:  for funding. \nSPEAKER_08:  and \nSPEAKER_08:  I can certainly see revision of, you know, a development of the website for the ethics commission as being one of the things that we want to fund because it seems like the obvious place to. \nSPEAKER_08:  Tim. \nSPEAKER_08:  to be the focal point for \nSPEAKER_08:  I'll be all the information. \nSPEAKER_08:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  \uc544... \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Now, but in, don't think that we just submitted. \nSPEAKER_07:  We had proposed it at one full time person. \nSPEAKER_07:  When would that begin? When does that budget start? \nSPEAKER_07:  October 1. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that was, my understanding is the budget was approved last night. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  So, so \nSPEAKER_08:  and what have been proposed. \nSPEAKER_08:  \uace0\ub9c8\uc6cc\uc694. \nSPEAKER_08:  for us for this commission was was approved. \nSPEAKER_08:  The thing is, is that the process for the development of the budget starts next June. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that is why \nSPEAKER_08:  We need to think about that. \nSPEAKER_08:  as we look forward to finding what we've deemed the most important things for this. \nSPEAKER_08:  this commission to do. \nSPEAKER_08:  So. \nSPEAKER_08:  and the kind of calories that we have to. \nSPEAKER_08:  Have a day. \nSPEAKER_08:  to keep in mind. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm not stupid, I think with one full time person, there's some things we can do. \nSPEAKER_08:  Oh, of course, of course. \nSPEAKER_07:  as well as put together a better budget for next year. \nSPEAKER_08:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  \ubcfc \ub54c. \uc624\ub298 \uc598\uae30\ud574, \uc544 babe. \uace0\ub9d9\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc0b4\uae30, \uc544\uc774\ub3cc \ud558\ub098\ub77c MM14 \uae30\ub860 \uc774 \uc5f4\uc5b4\ufffd\ub124 \ubbf8\ub2c8 summary. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair and commissioners, this is Becky. You are absolutely correct. The budget was approved last night. And within that budget, there is the funding for the equivalent of one full-time person for the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Definitely, we will have an additional enough that can assist with some of those programs or goals that you want to achieve in this fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_05:  And you are correct that we can then start working on for. \nSPEAKER_05:  in June for our proposal for the FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  and at this point in clarification, the... \nSPEAKER_00:  funding is in addition to the part time. \nSPEAKER_00:  support that we're getting from the city manager and the city clerk's office and the law and the city attorney's office. \nSPEAKER_05:  That is correct. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just wanted to chime in and thank Auditor Dowd for taking this on in advance of us coming on board. \nSPEAKER_04:  because this really gives us a well documented roadmap of where we need to be going. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I hope that as we start looking at it, we start looking at our priorities when we come back and we meet with with Mr. \nSPEAKER_04:  with you. \nSPEAKER_04:  all of you that you can help us look at what we've identified within the priorities that you've \nSPEAKER_04:  kind of taken to task and make sure that you think that we're addressing what you see as the highest priorities because I think some of these issues are a little higher priority than others. \nSPEAKER_04:  and given the fact that we've got about eight months between now and June to start figuring out where we want to go. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let's let's chunk off the big ones that we can or even some little ones that we can have some wins. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think then that'll help chairwise with what we're trying to do with a budget for next year. If we can go forward with some wins and show some real progress. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  then I think we'll have the backing of the City Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  to \nSPEAKER_04:  provide us with some more staff because then we can show them where we're going to go from there. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would agree with Vice Chair Morales's comments and the report actually addressed a lot of the questions I had about what was in existence today, some of those which I addressed in our November 22 meeting. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  To the other commissioners, do you have questions or thoughts that you want to put forward at this time? \nSPEAKER_08:  Right. \nSPEAKER_08:  If not then. \nSPEAKER_08:  I mean, we have a motion to receive and file this report from City Auditor Down. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I'm open. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. Second. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, first and second, all in favor? Oh. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry, who's the seconder? \nSPEAKER_08:  But it's Jamour Alice. \nSPEAKER_08:  And please call Rollin' it out. \nSPEAKER_06:  Please call the roll and it'll end. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Dave Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Mr. Herfiedler? \nSPEAKER_06:  Mr. Murphy. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Pollack. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Chattweau. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just want to ask staff real quickly. Have there been any comments? \nSPEAKER_04:  yet on any items on the agenda that we need to hear from the public on. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, there were no e-commerce or email submitted for this meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, we'll move to item number three then and that is recommendations to receive and file report from the ad hoc committees on the applicant selection process for the Long Beach independent redistricting commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  Attached to one of the emails that we received was \nSPEAKER_04:  a collection of the \nSPEAKER_04:  5 \nSPEAKER_04:  applicants chosen by each of the subcommittees. \nSPEAKER_04:  so that we have 45 finalists. \nSPEAKER_04:  I believe five from each. \nSPEAKER_04:  each committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  to move forward. \nSPEAKER_04:  Everyone is aware of that document. \nSPEAKER_00:  I am. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Other than that, is there anything else that the committee any of the committees have to report out as to what their \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  Their findings were \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not seeing any. Let me ask staff is on this item other than to receive the \nSPEAKER_04:  those. \nSPEAKER_04:  collection of \nSPEAKER_04:  candidates, is there anything else that we need to do under this item? \nSPEAKER_00:  share why this is Amy Weber. No, I don't think there's anything else that needs to be done. I think the next item \nSPEAKER_00:  which have to do with the next steps in the process. \nSPEAKER_00:  will probably sort of move things forward a little bit more. I'd just like to comment on the fact that the commissioners involved in all of you all. \nSPEAKER_01:  just like \nSPEAKER_00:  We're so thorough and we're faced with such a huge task of going through. \nSPEAKER_00:  so many resumes from very well-qualified individuals. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I think that you really rose to the occasion and did a wonderful job. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I think my only... \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I agree it was it was a heavy lift, but was happy to look through applications that I received and they were very \nSPEAKER_03:  impressive and reflective of the communities. \nSPEAKER_03:  and on each. And I think for me the only piece that was maybe of concern was to look at the demographics in total to make sure that \nSPEAKER_03:  It was representative of various identities and communities and I feel \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, we're moving forward with the candidates that we've all. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, identify. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  A part of the report from the committees I suppose would also be the report that was compiled. \nSPEAKER_04:  by the staff, which does show us the, what we call the demographics of the 45 candidates that are moving, moving that would be moved forward under this process that we've adopted. So I suggest that be part of \nSPEAKER_04:  of what we receive and file here as well, because that does record the diversity of the collectively of the 45 finalists. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, we can include that on this item. I also included it actually for item four, but I'll put it on both items. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, very good. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does anyone else have any other comments about the... \nSPEAKER_04:  the ad half committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  selection process. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's want to make sure we're sending a nice letter to the people that we didn't select just like we heard for the commissioners because it's everyone is said the quality of the people that applied was just stellar. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I know they'll be disappointed, but it \nSPEAKER_02:  It was tough. \nSPEAKER_02:  tough winnowing down to just five in each district. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let me just ask a question about the procedure going forward that is related to those letters. \nSPEAKER_04:  will in this pool. \nSPEAKER_04:  of 45 be the same pool that the \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  commissioners who are picked. \nSPEAKER_04:  move on and are ultimately picked at random to be on the commission is that the pool that they will work from to pick the the additional commissioners for the redistricting commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, so from this point, you will conduct the 45 interviews and then narrow the pull down from the 45 applicants down to the sub pull of 20 to 30. And then from that sub pull of 20 to 30, Chair, you will randomly select the first nine commissioners and then from that remaining sub pull, which would be about like 12, \nSPEAKER_01:  two to, or sorry, the, the remaining sub pull my math is off right now, sorry. So the remaining sub pull will be, um, \nSPEAKER_01:  available to be selected by those nine commissioners to select the remaining four commissioners and two alternates. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, well, I endorse completely, um, Vice Chair's, uh, where else is suggestion that a very nice letter we sent to the, to the applicants, encouraging them to \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanking them and encouraging them to continue there. \nSPEAKER_04:  involvement and concern about \nSPEAKER_04:  What's going on in the city? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, and we'll use the ones we sent out for the ethics commissioners as a template to kind of send the applicant to or move on to the next phase. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. Alright. So, um, \nSPEAKER_04:  If there's no further comments then may we have a motion to receive and file on the report from the commit the ad hack committees as well as the \nSPEAKER_04:  summary of the demographics of the 45 finalists. \nSPEAKER_04:  from staff. \nSPEAKER_00:  So moved. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have the same. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  second. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right, all right, please call the role and the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Missionary Day Bendictus. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Mr. Feedler. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Pollack. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner or Vice Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Lou Wung Kurt White? \nSPEAKER_04:  I"

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Then we're on to item number four and this is a recommendation to approve the interview process for the \nSPEAKER_06:  Longage Independent Redistricting Commission, including the list of applicants to interview timing and interview questions. So \nSPEAKER_00:  Also thank you for\ubb3c you \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm going to turn it over to staff briefly to explain what they would. \nSPEAKER_06:  how they would suggest we proceed at this point. \nSPEAKER_00:  you. \nSPEAKER_03:  JT, we're going to walk us through the process. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I can start it. So as of right now, I sent you the email that was just sent to you regarding the schedules. So for the interviews, we're looking to schedule them by district. And for those dates, it'll be Wednesday, October 7th at 2pm, Thursday, October 8th at 3pm, Friday, October 9th at 2pm. We're looking to do four districts on Wednesday, October 7th. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  We're looking and then for Thursday, October 8th, we'll do two districts because we have a time constraint for that meeting. And then on Friday, October 9th, we'll do the remaining three. \nSPEAKER_01:  and for the \nSPEAKER_01:  For the interviews, we sent you the sample interview questions from that kind of we researched, and then we included the two questions at the end were from the Ethics Commission interviews for the commissioner process for that. And we recommend 10 minute interviews since the last time it went a little bit long, and we had a lot of gaps. \nSPEAKER_01:  and doing them back to back so we can schedule it so there's not too much downtime. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, so the new would need us to win out down these 10 questions. How many remind me again, how many we have when we were entering the commissioners and then also JT you're doing so good at making sure we have excellent questions that one and eight or repeat of each other. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, sorry. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  We pulled them from there. \nSPEAKER_01:  We pulled them from various sources, so I think... \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  important question you got it in their twice. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, yeah, I think I thought there were a number of questions that were essentially repeats, but different ways of saying them. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, and actually that kind of helped me. \nSPEAKER_04:  in focusing on the questions and what did I really want to hear. \nSPEAKER_04:  So \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, and then for the ethics, commission, interviews, we did three questions, and we recommend doing about the same this time as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  that ethics. \nSPEAKER_08:  JT, can you remind me if we ask the questions orally or if they were just on a slide? \nSPEAKER_08:  Vater qui est le sty \nSPEAKER_01:  So we just had them on a slide last time. And the interviewees were provided them in advance. And for the commissioners that went through the interview process, if you have any suggestions. \nSPEAKER_01:  or comments concerned anything please let us know. \nSPEAKER_04:  I actually was thinking to suggest that we do the same thing in terms of providing the questions in advance. \nSPEAKER_04:  I thought that. \nSPEAKER_04:  and they will send to put their best foot forward because not everyone \nSPEAKER_04:  not everyone's strength is public speaking. \nSPEAKER_04:  But you could tell in the interviews if they were sincere, even though they were a little more prepared. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, we can duplicate that process and send out the questions you select in advance when we decide to schedule those interviews. \nSPEAKER_00:  I agree with Bobby. It was very helpful. I did spend time preparing. I still was tongue tied, but having the prompt the \nSPEAKER_00:  The visual prompt of the questions is also critical. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, well, we're going to be doing these though. I think by Zoom, so it'll be an interesting. \nSPEAKER_04:  way to prop. I guess you can put this slide underneath the pictures. Yeah so \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so the plan I think is so you can see both the the interviewee when they're speaking that will just list the questions in the chat for each interview and then so that'll bump it down to where they can see them and refer to them in the chat and we'll explain that those instructions When we send out the email to schedule the districts and all the interviews \nSPEAKER_07:  JT, I have a quick question and comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  I recall that during the interviews for the \nSPEAKER_07:  ethics commission there with the. \nSPEAKER_07:  some sort of timing mechanism, I don't know if it was on the slide. \nSPEAKER_07:  accompanying where with the questions posted. \nSPEAKER_07:  or something to that effect. \nSPEAKER_07:  In light of the 45 interviews, we've got to go through and the \nSPEAKER_07:  limited time to do them. \nSPEAKER_07:  and especially with the added challenge of doing this now over. \nSPEAKER_07:  Zoom, is there going to be a similar mechanism that we can provide for \nSPEAKER_07:  the interviewees. I found that to be very helpful in \nSPEAKER_07:  budgeting time in preparing to answer the three questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think it would be \nSPEAKER_07:  So it was very helpful for us to keep things. \nSPEAKER_07:  moving efficiently and also helpful for the interview. I'm not sure if we can do that over Zoom, but I would \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would just sort of recommend that of the helpful elements to the process. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so I'll work with TI staff to see what we can do about that. We may just have to give them a verbal. You have one minute remaining kind of thing, even though it will interrupt their thought process, or if anyone has any recommendations for that, if we are unable to get a timer in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, I mean something something that would be. \nSPEAKER_07:  posted and sort of accessible or visible for everyone. I think we'll also just kind of ensure. \nSPEAKER_07:  that we adhere to. \nSPEAKER_07:  giving each interview the same amount of time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  Again, I know it's difficult to resume. \nSPEAKER_07:  But you know, I just think that would \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  It was helpful, but also I think it would be. \nSPEAKER_07:  important and sharing we're equally distributing time for each person. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, we'll definitely look into that. And then also, I think I forgot to mention that we planned for like a five minute statement like we did for the ethics, the original ethics commission interviews. And then we'll just do a five minute time period for any follow up questions and notes. So instead of doing last time we did five minutes for question or five minutes for the statement, five minutes for follow up questions and then additional five minutes for the notes. But it didn't seem like we needed all that time. So we can kind of, since we have 45 interviews to do, kind of shrink down that time to make it more efficient. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we'll also be sending out like a schedule and everything for the interviews and applicants and everything. \nSPEAKER_02:  One thing that JT was talking to technology and innovation about is whether or not we can technologically with Zoom. \nSPEAKER_02:  kind of group interview ease. \nSPEAKER_02:  so that we have a little bit less downtime. So that is... \nSPEAKER_02:  So that if someone is ready to go, they can go next without having to have the commissioners sit there and wait. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, wait a set time period. So that's something else that he's going to talk to them about. I think, right, JT? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yet, so we were discussing that, and I think the best option will just have the interview, the interviewees enter the web X meeting, and instead of having different rooms and the possibility for being disconnected and everything, so they'll be able to call in, and then they can put their video up the entire time, or just for their interview, but we'll recommend they have their video up if possible. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then we'll include anything in the chat. If they have any questions, they can chat me or Kyle who is with me directly. So we can kind of talk to them if they have any questions or problems. \nSPEAKER_08:  JT for us as commissioners asking questions. Would that be via chat or I went anticipating what we'd be doing for our questions. We just make those as oral questions, correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, you would just do oral questions as follow up to their statement during that five minute period. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then Steve. \nSPEAKER_08:  or all public meetings so the candidates can participate in all of the session that they chose. So, too, is correct. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so the way we'll set it up is we will only send the WebEx information if we end up going with the, we'll finalize the process once we get everything squared away. But once we'll only send the WebEx information, meeting information to the interviewees for that meeting, but the meetings are available online to be streamed on our Granicus website. \nSPEAKER_01:  so they can watch it. \nSPEAKER_02:  In other words, the only applicants will be able to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  but the public will be able to listen in as it is, as is the case with this meeting, for example. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  I will talk about this little kid and talk with him more about that he had good weather, that he had good place or was keeping our head connected and wear utmost strength but had outreach experience. were \nSPEAKER_08:  that have been a related question. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_08:  I can wait. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a question about \nSPEAKER_06:  People's ability to see when someone wants to \nSPEAKER_06:  listen to a meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  live, they don't get to see it, all they get to do is hear it. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, right now that's the way we have it set up. I believe if the commission wants to have the videos put on the actual granicus, we can try to work on that. But like today, we had trouble with the feed so the PowerPoint wasn't available to be streamed on the granicus. So we're working out those details. But if it's possible, then and that's the wish of the commission, we can have the videos on the granicus feed. \nSPEAKER_06:  I see. Okay. Well, maybe that's a procedural question to address. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the future as you all figure out the technology. \nSPEAKER_06:  better, but I was surprised when I went to look back at these meetings that there's no pictures available. It's just \nSPEAKER_06:  It's all \nSPEAKER_06:  just audio. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm \nSPEAKER_01:  So, sharewise, moving forward, do you want us to try to include the videos in the... \nSPEAKER_06:  you at first five minutes two each. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the granicus feed. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the streaming feed. \nSPEAKER_01:  If possible. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is that what the City Council does? \nSPEAKER_01:  So right now the city council, they just put a picture of the council members at the moment. I do believe some commissions do have the videos up, but I'm not sure if that's in the chambers, the way we're doing it, or if it's when they're just on the actual Cisco, WebEx, or Zoom feeds, because some commissions don't actually meet through the chamber. They just meet on the platform, and they post the meeting information that's viewable to the public. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right. So for council meetings, the council members and the mayor are not doing video there, there's like JT just mentioned, it's just the picture of when they're speaking a picture of them pops on the screen. \nSPEAKER_01:  video. \nSPEAKER_03:  but they're not doing live video. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Well \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't know that we want to go into all these details right now because it might be something to talk about. \nSPEAKER_06:  when we have a little more. \nSPEAKER_06:  free time, shall I say? \nSPEAKER_06:  But to me, the problem with just having audio is you don't know who's speaking. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you're just. \nSPEAKER_06:  if you're just listening in. \nSPEAKER_06:  So \nSPEAKER_06:  That's why I think having pictures or something would be would be useful to anybody that's watching. \nSPEAKER_06:  so they can identify the speaker. \nSPEAKER_06: \u62dc\u62dc \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm \nSPEAKER_06:  Again, I think this is something we can talk about going forward in terms of how we want to proceed. \nSPEAKER_06:  We will be able to see each other, and we'll be able to see that the applicants in person. \nSPEAKER_06:  live when they're \nSPEAKER_06:  wouldn't we're interviewing them right? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's the most important thing right now, I think. \nSPEAKER_08:  There's a guy. \nSPEAKER_06:  there you go. \nSPEAKER_08:  there was a if there if we're interviewing the \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  All the questions are in advance. \nSPEAKER_08:  All the applicants are going to be slated for particular time. \nSPEAKER_08:  Do we randomly select them? \nSPEAKER_08:  either group \nSPEAKER_08:  or is it another method? So because it seems like the first person could have an advantage or perceive disadvantage by going number one. And so do we do it through a random selection or is there another method that we have? What did we choose when we did the commission interviews? \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe it was based on the responses that were provided by the applicants. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that's right, because time plots, your rights. \nSPEAKER_06:  So what's the proposed timing for each, if the timing is 10 minutes, how much of it is going to be given to them to answer their questions? \nSPEAKER_01:  So we're proposing a five minute statement to answer all the three questions or however main questions the commission decides and then the five minutes following that to be for follow up questions and then to take any notes. \nSPEAKER_01:  day day. \nSPEAKER_04:  Exactly. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  We can fall. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll be able to finish five an hour. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. Yes. All right. And then. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  And then Becky, I think your idea was if it ends early, we'll just move directly into the next one. Was that correct? \nSPEAKER_03:  Correct. So I'm thinking of overlapping groups like having them sign in to WebEx, like 15 minutes before the actual start. So that way if we finish with the first group first, we can then immediately, if we want to, if you the commission wants to, they can start with the next group and there is then like a big gap. \nSPEAKER_03:  where there's nothing to do. \nSPEAKER_06:  I do think with that on October 7th with four districts, you should give us a break between \nSPEAKER_06:  the first two groups in the second two groups. Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  What should we go to the questions and decide which \nSPEAKER_06:  If you want to do two or three or whatever. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would be good. \nSPEAKER_06:  I like question number eight. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think question. I really like question. \nSPEAKER_08:  question number one better. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  No, I'm teasing. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, I actually did it. I think it was more accurate, isn't it? 15 \nSPEAKER_04:  And then... \nSPEAKER_01:  So for the numbers, we'll change the numbers on that. Those are based on other commissions that we did research on. I didn't actually edit the questions, unfortunately, sorry. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the supplement, there was no supplemental questionnaire in number one. That's why I went to number eight. \nSPEAKER_06:  either one doesn't matter to me as long as it's. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm with you on that. \nSPEAKER_08:  in my comment was made in just I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_05:  I agree that one or eight, that's an important question. I think number five is important information for us to have also, but I don't think it needs to be part of the interview. \nSPEAKER_05:  JP is, is that something that you could discern from them when you contact them about their their interview. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I can include that in the email that I send out to them. I'll also be including like a little statement about the time commitment to make sure they're still willing to, it's of moving timeline still. And then also just to make sure they know what the next steps are regarding the interviews and the selection of the pool and random selection and all of that kind of additional information. \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll see you next time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Perfect. \nSPEAKER_05:  Then I also like question number seven. \nSPEAKER_07:  I will, yeah, I will echo, uh, lightning question number seven as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  And if we could squeeze in a three, I think nine would be good. Also, some of them answered nine in their essay. \nSPEAKER_05:  But in reviewing some of the other candidates over the last couple of days, \nSPEAKER_05:  Some of them didn't answer that question and I think it would be important information for us to have us to why they really think. \nSPEAKER_05:  they would be a good addition to the commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I thought nine. \nSPEAKER_04:  was more open-ended and in a good way. \nSPEAKER_04:  But yeah, either three or nine, but I thought nine. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  Left. \nSPEAKER_04:  more for the \nSPEAKER_04:  interview we to decide how to address the question which I thought was good. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then just for some clarification for question number 8, do you also want to include points A and B in the question? \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we were going with one instead of eight. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sorry, for question one, do you want to include the... \nSPEAKER_01:  8 points a and b. \nSPEAKER_04:  world. \nSPEAKER_04:  Or was it eight Commissioner wise, which was which were you proposing? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I proposed eight, but that was mostly because I was. \nSPEAKER_06:  I didn't like the reference to supplemental questionnaire and number one at \nSPEAKER_06:  either one. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think gets the substance that we \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  But either way, you would include A and B when you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Dia. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, one clue that, thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I like to be in number eight better than the be in number one. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm good with that. \nSPEAKER_04:  8-5. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I agree and I agree that the reference to the supplement of questionnaires. \nSPEAKER_08:  wordy and unnecessary. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have eight, we have nine. \nSPEAKER_04:  in seven, in the light seven also. \nSPEAKER_00:  in seven, in the light seven also. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  I would think that we might work them. \nSPEAKER_08:  Lead off with question number nine. \nSPEAKER_08:  good opening and \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, it might be something that they would, that would help them frame their opening statement too. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  So how about if I make a motion that we. \nSPEAKER_05:  asked staff to put it into the questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Number... \nSPEAKER_05:  Nine. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, wait, is it nine? \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  kind of a combination of one and eight. \nSPEAKER_05:  And seven. \nSPEAKER_05:  with 14 \nSPEAKER_05:  querying them on question five and there are their ability way sets up the interviews. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, we can do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Was that a motion? No, I can second it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  can. \nSPEAKER_06:  Are there any further comments on that motion? \nSPEAKER_06:  Seeing none, please call the roll. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner, Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Mr. Chautwell. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hi. Vice Chair Marles. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  (?) \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  And let me ask staff, do we need to? \nSPEAKER_06:  pass anything further with reference to approving the interview process. You want us to confirm those dates or \nSPEAKER_06:  the timing or the other details that we've \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  we've discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  here. \nSPEAKER_03:  We also need to approve Amy the applicants, the numbers, like stadium for the record. \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe we did that in the previous action item. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll see you guys later. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  We did. Okay, I missed it. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry about that. We did that one really quickly. \nSPEAKER_03:  We did that one. \nSPEAKER_06:  We didn't say them, but we didn't say them. That was my thing. \nSPEAKER_06:  The report, you could call the, I mean, if you want, you could put them into the motion. If it's important that they be. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the minutes. \nSPEAKER_06:  That way it's supposed to just in the report that includes their applications. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think it was included, the report was included in the previous item. And so as JT, I think someone even asked JT about it, that will make it into the minute. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, very quick. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, so do you need anything else from us then on the interview process? Any further motions passed besides identifying this three questions? \nSPEAKER_06:  and then. \nSPEAKER_06:  Question them. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the task. \nSPEAKER_02:  contact them. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think the balance of the motion was to receive and file the staff recommendation. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. Did we, did we get a record? Did I miss or did we get a recommendation in writing about this? \nSPEAKER_01:  No, that was just the verbal kind of report at the beginning and the discussion of. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi, it'sWatch\u79d2, welcome and everyone. \nSPEAKER_00:  discussion now. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  the 10 minute interviews and the dates and times outline. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the overlapping. \nSPEAKER_06:  with the overlapping. \nSPEAKER_01: \u793e\u9577 \nSPEAKER_06:  Very well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Then may we have a motion to approve and file the staff report regarding the \nSPEAKER_06:  The details. \nSPEAKER_06:  the timing and scheduling of the \nSPEAKER_06:  interviews. \nSPEAKER_06:  So. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  right? \nSPEAKER_06:  A second. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  second. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right. Please call the roll and the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sorry, was that Commissioner Dave and Adictus for the second?
