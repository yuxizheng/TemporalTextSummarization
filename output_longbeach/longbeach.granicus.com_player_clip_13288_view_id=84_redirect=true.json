        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  Right, item number two please. \nSPEAKER_06:  Recommendation to receive and file a review of the city's general fund budget projection, trends and implications. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, I would like to turn this over to staff. \nSPEAKER_07:  Ya sure? \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. Getting Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee, this presentation will review the General Fund trends for FY 23 for both revenue expense and expense and implications for the future. \nSPEAKER_03:  Geraldine Aleyho, our revenue officer and Nader Kamouj, our budget management officer, are here with me to help present. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd like to start off with providing some context on how we arrived at today's projection for FY23, starting back to what was happening in March of 2020. So I'll be going through the main key points and developments that impacted our projections in chronological order rather than by fiscal year because I'd like to point out how there is overlap that happens between the chronological timeframe and what is known at the time of making projections for different fiscal years. I hope this helps to show the context of how projections for future fiscal years are made and what information is available at the time various projections are made. \nSPEAKER_03:  So starting with March of 2020, this was when the pandemic hit the city in full force and stay at home orders were issued. At this time, the budget process for the FY21 budget was put on pause until June. A modified process was then implemented and the FY21 budget was adopted in September with projections that anticipated the impact of the pandemic on our revenues and expenses. \nSPEAKER_03:  At that time, we were projecting a $30 million shortfall that was balanced with a mix of structural and one-time solutions, including the employee furlough that was anticipated to generate about $11 million for the general fund, and also the use of $8 million in reserves. Then, in February of 2021, we came back to City Council with the report on how FY20 ended. We ultimately ended the year with a $21 million general fund shortfall, and needed to use operating and emergency reserves to close out that year. So this was the first time in recent history we had to utilize our reserves at the end of the year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Then starting in March of 2021, we began to get some good news. We were awarded federal and other grants and developed the Long Beach Recovery Act as a city. And this allowed us to eliminate the employee furloughs for the second half of FY21 and provided funds that were able to be used to replenish the reserves that had been utilized and drawn down upon at the end of FY20. \nSPEAKER_03:  With this good news of external funding support, the FY22 budget was adopted in August of 2021 as a pause year where the projected 30 million shortfall would be balanced with one time funding made available through the Long Beach Recovery Act. So minimal changes were made to services through this budget and the pause year was intended to help allow the city to have additional time to see how the economy would continue to react to the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  Then fast forward to February of 2022, we brought to City Council the year and report for FY21. This was a very significant report in that this was the first full year after the pandemic. Revenues were not as severely impacted by the pandemic as anticipated in August of 2020 when we ended and we ended with a surplus of 2.2 million in the general fund. And this report became the basis of making updated projections for FY22 and the basis of the development of FY23 in the coming months. \nSPEAKER_03:  A month later, in March of 2022, we came to counsel with our early FY23 budget projections to kick off the FY23 budget development process. This projection took into considerations all the revenue improvements that we had observed from FY21 year end and anticipated an 11.8 million shortfall. With FY21 ending better than anticipated, we had Long Beach Recovery Act funds available, and so the plan was to cover the 12 million or so shortfall with these funds to help cover the city for one more year. Shortly after this, we heard from the States to Prem Court that they had declined to review the city's Measure M litigation, which meant a permanent revenue reduction for the general fund. \nSPEAKER_03:  Then in May of 2022, we provided City Council with our FY22 mid-year performance report. This report also reflected the improved projections based on the data we had seen as of FY21 year end, and some early preliminary data points available for FY22. Our previous FY22 projection of 30 million shortfall had improved to 18 million, \nSPEAKER_03:  This number did not factor in the measure and litigation loss of about 8.5 million because we had previously set aside reserves to address the revenue loss in case the outcome was not favorable to the city, which what it was ending up happening. \nSPEAKER_03:  We are still in the middle of FY22 and so how we actually and the year is still to be known and we will be providing a final report in February of 2023 per our normal schedule to City Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this brings us to month of August, 2022 today, where the, or in August, this month, where the proposed budget was released. The projected shortfall, structural shortfall remains similar at 11.7 million and 4.9 million of one times. If you factor in the revenue loss of measure and our shortfall is 20.2 million, however, as I mentioned before, we had reserves set aside for FY23 as well to cover the city and not disrupt the budget development process, as we did not know when we would hear back from this Supreme Court. After FY23, no reserves have been set aside for the measure and litigation revenue loss and will need to be addressed structurally. So I'll now turn it over to Geraldine Alejo, who will go over the revenue trends. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Grace. Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. \nSPEAKER_02:  Since the March Alloc presentation, the anticipated improvement from prior FY 23 projections remains largely unchanged across the key revenue streets. \nSPEAKER_02:  excluding measure and revenue loss. Fiscal year 23 revenue projections are higher than previous by 22 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is the main driver for the reduced FY23 general fund shortfall. \nSPEAKER_02:  from 35.6 million projected back in August 2021. \nSPEAKER_02:  to the current $11.7 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  The FY23 shortfall of $11.7 million includes funds set aside to mitigate the measure and revenue loss of $8.5 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  Without these set aside funds, the projected shortfall would be 20.2 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  As noted, bring the March out of presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  The Star of the General Fund Outlook story this year continues to be revenue. \nSPEAKER_02:  Revenue Growth Projections for FY 23 have improved significantly from our previous FY 23 projections anticipated. \nSPEAKER_02:  this time last year during the FY22 proposed budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  As disclosed during the FY 21 year end performance report brought to City Council on February 8th. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the FY22 Budget Performance Report. \nSPEAKER_02:  brought to City Council on May 24th. \nSPEAKER_02:  Revenues have rebounded from the pandemic and performed better than expected. \nSPEAKER_02:  This slide shows examples of major revenue sources and the changes since the prior FY23 projections from this time last year. \nSPEAKER_02:  with non-measure A sales and use tax improving by 12% and property tax improving by 38. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is comparing and showing the difference between last year's FY23 Revenue Projections to the updated fiscal year 23 Revenue Projections. \nSPEAKER_02:  specific information on these and other revenue drivers compared to the FY 2022 budget will be reviewed in the next slides. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  Here is a table outlining the drivers for the General Fund Shortfall projection with the amounts noting the incremental change between FY22 and FY23 under the first two columns titled sources and uses. \nSPEAKER_02:  The last column title, Net Impact, Too Fun. \nSPEAKER_02:  shows whether the item helps or hurts the shortfall status with positive numbers being things that help the shortfall by making it smaller. \nSPEAKER_02:  and negative numbers being things that hurt or make the short fall worse. \nSPEAKER_02:  compared to the FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  We are projecting revenues to increase by 25.3 million and are budgeted expenses to increase by 22. \nSPEAKER_02:  0.2 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  The city manager's proposed budget has a net structural impact of about 800,000. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have additional measure a support for operations as discussed in the March presentation around $3 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  We also have a line that backs out the impact to measure a revenue incremental increases as measure a revenues and expenses are accounted for separately and not part of the general fund bottom line when calculating the surplus or shortfall status. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have a line that backs out the funds needed to set aside for the measure B stabilization fund. \nSPEAKER_02:  And lastly, we have the impact of the 26.9 million shortfall that has carried over from FY 22, which hasn't been resolved with structural solutions. \nSPEAKER_02:  In total, you can see the shortfall is 20.2. \nSPEAKER_02:  And as reference, if you ignore the impact of the measure and litigation related revenue loss, \nSPEAKER_02:  Their shortfall would be 11.7. \nSPEAKER_02:  The next few slides will cover the notable changes from the FY22 adoptive budget for both expense and revenue. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  The next three slides will cover the are notable general fund revenue trends starting with the city's top revenue generators property tax and sales tax. \nSPEAKER_02:  Property tax increase by 9.8 million compared to the FY22 budget due to continued strength and property sales improvements and new developments in the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  Non-measure A-seals in use tax increased by 10.5 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  and includes improvement and growth across various categories such as recovery and hotels and restaurants and general consumer goods. \nSPEAKER_02:  in addition to continued growth in the county wide pool. \nSPEAKER_02:  The measure a decrease of 1.6 million is due to the measure a rate reduction to 3.4% \nSPEAKER_02:  in 2023. \nSPEAKER_02:  At this time, counties measure each will be effective. \nSPEAKER_02:  However, it should be noted that the revenue at the full 1% is projected at 83 million. \nSPEAKER_02:  and reflects similar positive trends and growth as noted for sales in use tax. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  In addition to property, sales and measure a revenues, \nSPEAKER_02:  other general fund revenues are anticipated to continue to grow from FY22 budgeted levels. \nSPEAKER_02:  This includes transient occupancy taxes, which were heavily hit during the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_02:  and are anticipated to increase by 2.4 million with full recovery to pre-pandemic levels anticipated for fiscal year 24. \nSPEAKER_02:  with TOT while it is continuing to recover. The projections are showing recovery slower than previously projected. \nSPEAKER_02:  and continues to be a volatile revenue source. \nSPEAKER_02:  Utilities user taxes are also projected to grow based on current your receipts. This includes adjusting FY 23 revenues for telephone, which is not currently experiencing as deep as a decline as anticipated in the FY 22 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  Cannabis tax revenues are projected to increase by 2.8 million from the FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  The FY23 budget assumes that activity will continue at these higher levels. \nSPEAKER_02:  first experience in fiscal year 20. \nSPEAKER_02:  and does not anticipate any potential changes to effective tax rates. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  and finally oil revenue continues to be budgeted at $55 a barrel. \nSPEAKER_02:  based on the financial practice of structurally budgeting lower than the likely oil price to hedge against risk of this revenue's high volatility. \nSPEAKER_02:  surplus funds realize above the structural budget of $55 barrel. \nSPEAKER_02:  can be used towards critical one-time needs and additional set of sites for oil well abandonment. \nSPEAKER_02:  with the projected oil price for fiscal year 22 at $90 a barrel. \nSPEAKER_02:  surplus funds this year will allow for 12 million for Titleist Capital projects as included in the FY 20 Rebudget. \nSPEAKER_02:  and cover an additional 25% increase to abandonment set of site amounts in fiscal year 22 for both Uplands and Tiglands. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will now turn it over to Nader Kamouj. \nSPEAKER_02:  who will review the major expense trends and drivers and the general fund fiscal outlooks for fiscal year 24 and beyond. \nSPEAKER_00:  Great, thank you, Geraldine. Good afternoon, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. I'll be giving a brief overview that highlight a few notable trends on the expense side of the general fund. \nSPEAKER_00:  To begin with the city's largest expense, salary changes are increasing by 19 million over the FY22 budget for several reasons, including previously negotiated pay raises and benefit changes in employee labor contracts and also normal step increases adjustments for current employees. Additionally, a general inflator representing potential cost of living increases, totaling 7.5 million is included for groups with contracts that are expiring the last day of FY22. \nSPEAKER_00:  In FY23, CalPERS Pensions Cost is a particularly notable as it's only increasing by approximately 518,000, which is significantly smaller than in previous years where CalPERS costs were some of the highest cost drivers in the general fund. This improvement in the cost projections is mainly in the result of a high investment return of 21.3% earned by CalPERS in 2021. \nSPEAKER_00:  For perspective, CalPERS' investments assumptions is 6.8% return. \nSPEAKER_00:  One important thing to note is that the trend may fluctuate and even change back to being an increased cost, depending on variables such as investment returns and CalPERS methodologies. \nSPEAKER_00:  A bad investment year can easily swing cost back up. It is likely that cost will continue to increase in FY 25 and beyond due to CalPERS preliminary estimates of minus 6.1% investment return for the year ending June 30th, 2022. \nSPEAKER_00:  the overall impact \nSPEAKER_00:  from the insurance fund to the general fund has decreased by 1.4 million. The insurance fund includes both the workers compensation fund and the general liability fund. While the general liability costs have been a main driver in the past few years, this year these costs have remained flat. Additionally, the overall premium rates for FY23 workers compensation has been reduced by 4.5% from the previous year as a healthy funds available status allowed for a reduction in the overhead rates. \nSPEAKER_00:  FY23 also includes 9.4% decline in premium rates for sworn safety officers, which correlates to a decline losses in paid. \nSPEAKER_00:  Additionally, additional details on the insurance fund will be presented in the next presentation in today's BOC meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Health fund benefit related costs are projected to increase by 2.6 million in the general fund. Health care spending is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels with increased cost adjustments partially due to the delayed care during the COVID lockdown. \nSPEAKER_00:  The potential long-term impacts of COVID-19 are difficult to estimate, but the industry currently anticipates an increase in medical services, late-stage cancer diagnosis, and mental health issues. These potential impacts may drive future healthcare costs and will be considered for future projections. \nSPEAKER_00:  Fleet related costs are projected to increase by 800,000 for expenses related to the city's purchase, maintenance, and replacements of vehicles. Expenses related to both parts and sublet services are anticipated to increase. In addition, fuel prices are anticipated to stay high in FY23, with current projections generating an estimated 31% increase over FY22's budget. \nSPEAKER_00:  Lastly, other expense changes, including things such as debt service payment, various citywide MOUs, and the city indirect cost plan is expected to increase by 400,000 from the FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_00:  A potential debt service payment to finance the fund owed to the water fund as a result of the measure M litigation is also included in this figure. \nSPEAKER_00:  The projection currently includes an interest-only payment in FY23, and both principal and interest payments beginning in FY24. \nSPEAKER_00:  The budget projection provided in March, the City Council at the start of the FY23 budget development process indicated an estimated structural shortfall of 11.8 million. With update projections, the impact of measure and litigation, and the FY23 proposed budget items, the structural shortfall is now 20.2 million plus proposed one-time uses of 5 million. \nSPEAKER_00:  When including the impact of, when excluding the impact of measure and litigation, the shortfall remain nearly the same at 11.7 million. The total shortfall in one time funding needs in FY23, totaling 25.1 million, are proposed to be resolved with funds made available from the Long Beach Recovery Act. A release a reserve set aside to mitigate the impact of measure M. FY22, Police Department budget savings earmarked for the Community Crisis Response Program. And savings from an update projection of the Citywide Indirect Cost Plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  Normally the use of one-time funds is not recommended as means to balancing a budget. But in this case, it was a strategic decision by the city to utilize one-time funds to allow the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  to provide priority services while the city and the community continue to recover and stabilize from the pandemic. In FY24, the projected structural shortfall of 25.6 million is largely due to the use of one-time funds in FY23. There are many factors that can change this projection. Some of these assumptions include \nSPEAKER_00:  A general cost of living wage increase are assumed for contracts that are expiring in FY23. This assumption will be revised based on the actual negotiated contracts. Future costs that may occur, but are not currently factored in, such as conversions to clean energy options. Also, the projection does not include any impacts that could result from a recession. Lastly, the projection does not include any additional costs incurred by the city in response to the pandemic, which is anticipated to be covered with one time in grants funding. \nSPEAKER_00:  With that, I would like to turn it over back to Grace Yoon, who will conclude this presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Neater. In closing, we are pleased to note that the FY23 projections are trending in a positive direction. This is good news starting from seeing the results of FY21 reported earlier this year in February of 2022, where the impact of the pandemic on our revenues were not as severe as originally anticipated. And as we move forward to future projections, it will be important to continue to maintain fiscal prudence and discipline, especially as the past two years have utilized one times to balance the budget and one-time solutions may not always be available. As our current projections are reflecting a shortfall situation in FY24, \nSPEAKER_03:  That will be one of our main focus in the upcoming year that is to develop strategies and approaches for achieving a structurally balanced budget for FY 24 and beyond. So we look forward to continuing to work with the BOC and City Council to address current and future budget challenges. This concludes our presentation and we are available to answer questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, thank you for that, all. \nSPEAKER_07:  That very, very detailed presentation. I see Council Member. \nSPEAKER_07:  Vice Chair, the one guys joined this is for them. \nSPEAKER_07:  Welcome. \nSPEAKER_07:  around \nSPEAKER_07:  I guess I'll turn it over to the... \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll just make a few quick comments. I mean, that was a very, very... \nSPEAKER_07:  detailed presentation almost felt like we should have been asking questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  after every slide. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have several notes here and I'll go. \nSPEAKER_07:  trying to keep up with it. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think I've \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, obviously there's some good news. And some others. \nSPEAKER_07:  strategies that are working for us. And so I salute our city management and financial management team for \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  great management of our budget. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  At the same time, I think... \nSPEAKER_07:  you know \nSPEAKER_07:  projections seem to be very, very \nSPEAKER_07:  We should be concerned with the salary projections that we are going to be experiencing in the coming year. \nSPEAKER_07:  and because I'm... \nSPEAKER_07:  Very, very pleased to see the wait returns, the Cal PERS. \nSPEAKER_07:  haven't seen the rate which is like that in some time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Can you explain where we have been like over the last three years with CalPERS wait returns overall? \nSPEAKER_07:  And just for those who may not know. \nSPEAKER_07:  what the average rate of returns should be. Would it look like? Wish it looked like. \nSPEAKER_07:  23.3% return and I guess that was FY 22 or 21 \nSPEAKER_07:  and we can explain where we are today and understand there's a projection of that even lower next year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, oh sure absolutely thank you chair Austin. So CalPERS has an assumed rate of return that is the basis for how they calculate what cities owe them as their piece of factoring into funding our pension plans. It used to be 7.5% of return that was the assumed rate but over the years through various different \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I guess reforms that has gone down to about 6.8% is what is the expected rate of return. So anything above 6.8% return is a gain for the city in terms of what was assumed in our projections and anything less than 6.8 even though it's a positive number would be considered a loss. So in the most recent year and there's also a two year lag in the year that they take the investment return and what fiscal year that it impacts us. So for example, \nSPEAKER_03:  The year ending 630 2020 for CalPERS, that's their fiscal year 20, I believe. The rate investment rate return was 4.7%. And that investment return affects three quarters of our FY23. The stat that Nader mentioned in the presentation was the investment return rate for the year ending 630 2021. And that was a 21.3%. So that's significantly higher than the assumed rate of return of 6.8%. And that mostly will affect our FY24, but it starts to impact our FY23. There are some, you know, those variables because we are a different fiscal year and things like that. And so that was something that has really... \nSPEAKER_03:  Back in March was looking very positive in terms of our cost for FY 23 and the out-year projections. However, just to dampen that, just slightly, the investment year ending 630-2022 looks to be the preliminary estimates looks to be a negative 6.1%. So that would be something that will affect our future years return mostly starting in our fiscal year 25. So again, it is very volatile in terms of \nSPEAKER_03:  how the market and investment return rates will affect our pension plans. That is something that is the byproduct of the changes that CalPERS has made before where it used to be more amortized over time. But this method that CalPERS has done allows us to be more in touch with what's actually happening and allowing our assets to either grow or shrink depending on what is actually happening in the market. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, and... \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I guess the overall economy is, is, uh, \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, what impacts the channel investments in work. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's the two of three. \nSPEAKER_07:  But is there anything significant? \nSPEAKER_07:  Going on, Evelyn. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  cause such a drastic shift. You know. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a really good question. I'm not sure exactly what might be happening in specifics, but I will say it's not uncommon to see this. I do know CalPERS does feel that their portfolio is still more risky than they would like, and that's why over time they are looking to change the mix of their investment portfolio to be less risky. Of course, what that means then though is there's more likely that while it becomes a little more stable, there's less return, and if there's less return, then there's more that funding has to come from city's contribution. So that is something that they are looking to do, and I think it's just part of it, it's just the nature of the market. \nSPEAKER_07:  Appreciate your love. \nSPEAKER_07:  explanation of that. We always want to be vigilant with people. \nSPEAKER_07:  no. \nSPEAKER_07:  at CalVERS. I understand. \nSPEAKER_07:  And also, the best new rates and what we stand. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's that's short time. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, I... \nSPEAKER_07:  I have a little bit of a challenge with the terms structural balance budget when we are \nSPEAKER_07:  actually dip it into reserves. \nSPEAKER_07:  and one times two, two, uh, \nSPEAKER_07:  It's a balance on budget. \nSPEAKER_07:  Can you explain, you know, \nSPEAKER_07:  how we use that term and buy \nSPEAKER_07:  and how we get to a balanced bird budget using \nSPEAKER_07:  reserves to or one times to balance our budget. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, absolutely. So what I would say is that for FY23, we have a balanced budget, but we would not say that we are a structurally balanced budget. A structurally balanced budget would be that where our ongoing expenses, or what we call our structural costs, have identified ongoing structural revenue sources. So revenue sources that we are able to project that they would come regularly into the future. Of course, with the caveat that, there's always variances from projections that's normal. What we've done in the past few years, given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, and really a fiscal situation that many cities have not faced before, is that we have utilized an influx of one-time funds from the federal government and other sources to... \nSPEAKER_03:  cover the gap for FY21. That was what happened when the Long Beach Recovery Act was developed. Also, that was the plan for FY22 and that is currently the plan for FY23 as well. So for those years, we would say that they are balanced in that \nSPEAKER_03:  The listed expenses in the budget are being covered, and there are identified funding sources to cover the problem or the costs for that year. But some of those sources are coming from sources that we consider to be one time in nature. And that's why we say they're balanced, but not structurally balanced. And so what we're hoping to do in the future is that when these one time sources run out, so to speak, we are needing to find solutions that can be more long term. And that would be when we would say it's a structural balance. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for that explanation. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have a few questions to eat up, but I want to help person opportunity for it. \nSPEAKER_07:  my colleagues to this committee to \nSPEAKER_07:  to weigh in and have their questions and comments taken into consideration. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Vice Chair, you're wrong, good, you haven't. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, well, basically, I see that we're going to have a balanced budget, although somewhat if you go into how you define. \nSPEAKER_08:  What a bounce, but you're his. \nSPEAKER_08:  But my major concern is how we do with our reserves. Are we? \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  So \nSPEAKER_08:  and \nSPEAKER_08:  function of the structure with our reserves be able to move forward are they growing are they decreasing where are we with our reserves. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, thank you, thank you, can we remember you, Ranga? So we have two major main reserves for our general fund. That's our operating reserve and our emergency reserve. And both of those remain intact. And part of the solution to balance, FY23, does not touch any of those reserves. So while we drew down from those reserves to balance the end of FY 20, the year we had a solution of significant negative and the year that we really faced the impact of the pandemic, we did draw down on those reserves. But once we were able to establish the Long Beach Recovery Act, that plan, we were able to replenish those reserves. So they are now restored back to the levels that they were. \nSPEAKER_03:  We are about 14.9 million for our operating reserve, which is all within the fiscal policy minimum of 2%, we're about, that's about 2.6%. And then for our emergency reserve, we're around 48 million or 47.8 million specifically. And it's about 8.5% of our normal operating expenses. And that's also within our fiscal policy, which is a minimum of 8% in a target level of 10. So happy to report that our main \nSPEAKER_03:  operating and emergency reserves remain intact. And these one times that we're talking really to cover the 23 \nSPEAKER_03:  Budget, shortfall, is really coming from those funds that are made available from the external funding sources through the Long Beach Recovery Act and also things like reserves that we had set aside specifically for specific purposes like the Measure and Litigation. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next time you covered some of those issues that I was looking at asking about measure M impacts in the future. \nSPEAKER_08:  as well as the projected shortfalls that we're going to have. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  23 and 24 for the 25. Excellent. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  That's all I had to say. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_07:  Great Council Member Bryce. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much and thank you so much for that excellent presentation from the entire team. I love how you guys spread it out so that everyone gets to participate in the presentation of the budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  It really makes for a very team-oriented presentation, and I appreciate that. I do have a couple of questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  My biggest concern is just our reliance on the Recovery Act and that's fine. I get it. It was very unprecedented circumstances, but \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think. \nSPEAKER_04:  the fact that we're consistently having this shortfall. \nSPEAKER_04:  with Ben \nSPEAKER_04:  aided by the Recovery Act and the federal dollars. But what are we doing moving forward in terms of the shortfall? \nSPEAKER_04:  and we keep talking about the shortfall. \nSPEAKER_04:  without measure M in it. And we know that after this year, we really don't have any sort of research set aside for measure M. \nSPEAKER_04:  So can you talk to me a little bit about that? What are our realistic plans with dealing with the shortfall given those two realities? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, thank you committee member price. That is a really excellent question. And that's something we take very seriously in the budget office and something we sometimes lose sleep over and debate over the use of the Long Beach Recovery Act Fund. Originally, we did not anticipate that we would be able to use it for FY23. Really, it was a covering FY20 and 21. And that was the allocation and then we were done. And so it was always that, you know, when we get to 22, we're going to need to really \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, hunker down and figure out as a city how we're going to balance our structural revenues with our structural expense. We are finding ourselves in a situation where as we discussed in the presentation, because the revenues are performing so much stronger than anticipated that there is much more Long Beach Recovery Act specifically in the category of securing our city's future, so not touching the other categories that are designated for the healthy communities and economic recovery, but just that pot of money that was really designated to help cities create a little bit of time to come up with strategy and have discussions on priorities and develop a way of balancing the budget that is taking into consideration city council priorities, community priorities, and to give us that time also to see how the economy will continue to rebound. So your question is a very \nSPEAKER_03:  important one was one that we do. \nSPEAKER_03:  mention and do emphasize that \nSPEAKER_03:  We are solving these things with one-time solutions and we recommend that given the situation and the fact that we do have these funds that were intended for this purpose. But once those funds run out, we do need to look at how we're going to solve the budget on a structural basis. So one positive thing I will say though is \nSPEAKER_03:  our shortfall size while we have been you're absolutely accurate in portraying as as we're just kind of planting the problem down each year. It has been shrinking. So we are kind of being that time that we are buying by planting it has worked out in our favor in the sense that the economy has gone a positive direction and has allowed us to update our projections to continue to kind of chip away at that shortfall number. And so that's something we're going to look to do in the future in terms of our strategy for FY 24 is really hone in even more with our consultants and are working with Geraldine with our revenue projections to see where we're at projection wise. And then working with the city manager and city council talking about priorities we're getting input from the community to really see are there efficiencies in how we do our operations what are other cost savings that we can do investments that we can do those are all things that we'll be really focusing on and looking into \nSPEAKER_03:  creatively as well, what are other sources that we may not have done, continuing to do our citywide fee study to make sure we're really like looking into every avenue to be the most fiscally prudent that allows us to provide the maximum number of services. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, well that's good. In terms of our revenue increases, I mean I know property taxes and sales taxes were the two major sources of increase that we saw. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  is there one that was particularly \nSPEAKER_04:  that one that app performed the other in a more \nSPEAKER_04:  Pominent way. \nSPEAKER_04:  of the two. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, I can start in Geraldine if you had anything else to add, you know, definitely feel free to. And I think property tax definitely performed better than projections, but sales tax really was the area of surprise. So I think initially when the pandemic hit, being one of our second largest property tax and sales tax are pretty close in being our two largest revenue sources for the general fund, you know, we had thought sales tax would take a pretty significant hit. And there was some of that that we saw definitely at the very beginning of the pandemic, but what we saw \nSPEAKER_03:  other than restaurants that category which was, you know, suffering. A lot of sales and \nSPEAKER_03:  did not suffer. It did not look like it suffered at all. People were continuing to buy things, things like auto, the category of auto, home improvement, \nSPEAKER_03:  cannabis. I mean, that wasn't a huge portion of our overall sales tax, but things like that were continuing to go up. And so that was probably, I would say, is that the biggest area of initial surprise and seeing the impact of the pandemic or the lack of the impact of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, let me just look here. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  We talked, there's a reference in there and I forgot what page it was now. \nSPEAKER_04:  about the decrease in our measure A as your result of the \nSPEAKER_04:  Measure H impact. Can you talk a little bit about that? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, sure. So we have a sales tax cap. And because our original measure plan was sunsetting after 10 years, but after six years, it was going from 1% down to half a percent. So that was our original plan. And then after that subsequent to that, the county measure, age, like the homelessness count, uh, \nSPEAKER_03:  sales tax was passed and then after that our measure extension was passed and so because of the cap when we in FY 23 when we go \nSPEAKER_03:  originally would just be 1%. \nSPEAKER_03:  but the \nSPEAKER_03:  County measure tax takes precedent over ours until FY 28. So in FY 23, we go from our current 1%. \nSPEAKER_03:  to 0.75% and then in FY28 we'll go back up to the 1% because that's an FY27 is when measure H ends and so it actually is a loss it's a decrease of revenue from what we're currently experiencing but it is actually higher than what we were originally anticipating at all which was originally we were going to be at 0.5% before the extension. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, got it. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm good. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, well, thank you Councilmember, great questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  I think if anything, there's a takeaway here, is that... \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, we \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  have been at this budget oversight process for several years. In the City Council for several years, several years as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  And we haven't had to. \nSPEAKER_07:  experience cuts as a result of you know some very \nSPEAKER_07:  are full maneuvering and \nSPEAKER_07:  planning projections with our budget. \nSPEAKER_07:  They've sold a lot of fast. Of cool new protein that they get, tonase changed the higher. I think that is not for me. It's not my dream if I just can't make it muscular. And of looks part of how many\u30ebte of protein I could. And therefore, you would like to wish some of it for your body. Okay, once again, standard consumers will \nSPEAKER_07:  for their work. Obviously, we're always, this is a vigilant process. \nSPEAKER_07:  We need to stay on it. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, we have to look for solutions as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know \nSPEAKER_07:  Each year a budget seems to grow, right, as along with our revenues. And so, \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  At some point, we're going to have to. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  like size or make some tough decisions or \nSPEAKER_07:  to without \nSPEAKER_07:  that growth. \nSPEAKER_07:  to meet the \nSPEAKER_07:  the structural needs of our budget about them. \nSPEAKER_07:  of \nSPEAKER_07:  So I'd like to open up for other comments. \nSPEAKER_05:  If there are any members of the public that wish to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature or if you're calling in by phone, please press star 9. \nSPEAKER_05:  Dave Shukla, you have three minutes. Your time begins now. \nSPEAKER_05:  Dave Schukele. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. Hello, can you help? \nSPEAKER_01:  Hello, can you help me? \nSPEAKER_05:  your time begins now. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sorry about that. Thank you for the presentation and for the opportunity comment on it. Brief question. \nSPEAKER_01:  at that slides 5 and 10. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  What is the exact amount? \nSPEAKER_01: shot twenty. And that's today's \nSPEAKER_01:  beyond $55 a barrel. \nSPEAKER_01:  How much surplus has the city received since October 1st? \nSPEAKER_01:  and how much can it anticipate? \nSPEAKER_01:  from now until, let's say. \nSPEAKER_01:  They're for you first. \nSPEAKER_01:  next week. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for your comment. Is there any other public comment? \nSPEAKER_05:  That concludes public comment, Chair. \nSPEAKER_07:  So for the benefit, I would just, we'll go to slide nine and 10. \nSPEAKER_07:  or show those slides. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  a big portion. \nSPEAKER_07:  Typically public comment is comment. There was questions asked there. \nSPEAKER_07:  We don't have a lot of public comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Take this privilege to... \nSPEAKER_07:  Allow staff to answer the questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  if you recall what they were specifically in look. \nSPEAKER_07:  was \nSPEAKER_07:  exactly the amount. So is it $45 per barrel over what we put? \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_07:  What did it? \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure, Chair Austin. So our financial practice for budgeting for oil is to keep it at $55 a barrel as it is a volatile revenue source and also something that is declining and something that is not a revenue source that will have in the longer long term. So at $55 a barrel, at the last mid-year performance report we brought to City Council in May, we were projecting an year average of about $90 a barrel. \nSPEAKER_03:  So what that means is normally we are able to fund various expenses covered by this revenue source. We are able to with the way the projections are looking like now, we're able to pay for the normal abandonment funding that we do each year. And you could see that on the slide our normal abandon demand is about 1.6 out of the Uplands Fund and then 7.1 in our Tidelines Fund. But with this additional revenue we're anticipated to be able to contribute up to 25% more so a total of 2 million for Uplands and 8.9 for Tidelines. \nSPEAKER_03:  In addition, with anticipated surplus funds, as mentioned in the presentation, we are anticipating that we can put about 12 million of CIP projects in the Thailand's area, and that has been included in the budget, the FY23 budget and part of Public Works CIP plan. And those are the things that we'll do. We are doing updated estimates for year-end to see how it will be and we'll have to revisit if at year-end what the actuals return out to be. But these are our latest projections. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for that. I hope that answers the question from public comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have not. \nSPEAKER_07:  Please feel free to. \nSPEAKER_07:  email your question to budget oversight committee. I office. \nSPEAKER_07:  Unnie listen to \nSPEAKER_07:  If I had to get that question answered, we're not proud of that man. \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_07:  So with that, we've heard from the comment, any more comment from behind the rail on this particular agenda item. \nSPEAKER_07:  very none. Let's please vote. \nSPEAKER_07:  to receive it from this. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can I please get a motion? \nSPEAKER_07:  So moved. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I second. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, Councilwoman Price. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  \uc544\uc774, \ub9c8\uc774\uce58\uc774 \uc624\ub791\uc544 \nSPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  and Chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_07:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. Do we still have one more agenda item? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Just uh \nSPEAKER_07:  And now we have a closed session at... \nSPEAKER_07:  for \nSPEAKER_07:  Clock \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_07:  Roughly how long do you think it'll take to get through the side of it? \nSPEAKER_07:  Guess I'm asking staff. \nSPEAKER_03:  Maybe like, I think, seven to eight minutes? \nSPEAKER_07:  All right."

We have Julie Richardson, our manager of risk and occupational health services, and also Greg Sorensen, our budget analysis officer who is going to provide this presentation. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good afternoon, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. I'm going to run through a lot of this pretty quickly. A lot of it is very similar to last year's presentation. \nSPEAKER_00:  All of the key terms and definitions are listed in the presentation, but I'll skip through those in light of the time. I do want to thank you for the opportunity though to speak about the city's insurance program. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I'm going to skip slide three, four. \nSPEAKER_00:  in light of the time. Again, those terms are there for you for reference if you need them. And I'm gonna jump to the types of purchases that the city has purchased this year. So we continue to purchase our workers compensation. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  And it is at a 5 million SIR currently, which is the same as previous years. And the only exclusion continues to be the injury must occur on or during the course of work. \nSPEAKER_00:  This is the most stable insurance market, and it continues to be very competitive because we are continuing to see on average a decrease in injuries for the last 10 years. \nSPEAKER_00:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_00:  The next type of insurance we purchased is our general liability. We've purchased 40 million in limits of our RSIR. It includes coverage, specialty coverage for unfair employment practices and public airs and official, sorry, public official airs and omissions. We have three different FI SIRs again this year. The first one's 10 million at that's for most of our police liability. Seven and a half million for most of our other liability except exclusions and five million dollars for the first weapon discharge claim for the police department. The exclusions continue to be anything related to communicable disease. Thanks to COVID, acts of terrorism and medical malpractice. \nSPEAKER_00:  The next one we purchase is our all-risk property insurance. This protects our property from covered parols, such as fire, vandalism, wind damage to city property and buildings. We also purchase earthquake coverage for our convention center and excess property coverage for the Queen Mary. \nSPEAKER_00:  are deductible, rebained at 1.5 million per claim or loss this year, and the exclusions remain as mold and communicable diseases. \nSPEAKER_00:  We also purchased miscellaneous coverage that's listed on the side. Storage Tank Crime Drone Marine coverage was also includes the Jones Act. Airport liability are aircraft coverage, which is for our helicopters, excess pollution, cybersecurity, volunteer medical coverage, as well as boiler and machinery. \nSPEAKER_00:  So to go over what the insurance market trends and challenges are, it continues to be a very hard market as it has been for the last several years. Because of that, there's less supply, so increased demand. It's causing the markets to continue to have higher rates. The availability of carriers continues to shrink, especially for public entities in California. \nSPEAKER_00:  some challenges that we're seeing in the general liability front. We continue to see significant increases in plaintiff demands and jury decisions. This all contributes to social inflation, which is increase in litigation and broader definitions of liability, which is causing cost to increase. We're seeing still a spotlight on police liability and rose design claims. Our high-loss history has caused our SIR to remain high. And like I mentioned, it's still very difficult and hard market. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the all-risk property coverage are deductible, remained at 1.5 million, which is at the burn layer. Insurance will cover losses above that burn layer, which is typically known as our catastrophic losses. It will continue to be a challenge. If our loss ratio does not decrease, last year I reported, it was at 173%. This year I'm happy to report that we did reduce it down to 41%. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so hopefully in the future, the underwriters for our insurance companies will consider that and allow us to decrease our deductible. \nSPEAKER_00:  So some accomplishments and opportunities that we've seen, despite the increases in premiums, Long Beach is still able to purchase insurance to finance our risk. Long Beach was able to maintain our police liability coverage as well as be included in the special officer involved shooting policy. This would save the city significant money in a large lawsuit involving an OIS. Risk management has partnered with the city attorney's office to better evaluate and monitor large loss claims more frequently. This will allow for greater transparency with insurance carriers and keep our premiums at a minimum. And we will continue to collaborate with departments to reduce risk exposures and reduce raw risk exposure and liability to the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I'll go ahead and turn it over to Greg Swornson, Budget Analysts Officer. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. I'm going to go through slides 13 and 14 rather quickly. They're fairly self-explanatory. \nSPEAKER_01:  The insurance fund group is made up of two main funds, the General Liability Fund and the Workers Compensation Fund, that we'll be discussing today. \nSPEAKER_01:  For the revenue sources, the main revenue source for these funds are charges to departments based on a combination of loss experience and risk exposure. The city hires industry professionals to provide actual aerial analysis and options for the city to determine the appropriate rates charged to departments. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  the \nSPEAKER_01:  Confidence levels refer to how likely we are to cover city's potential losses for a specific year. Rates are currently set at 60% for general liability costs and 60% for workers' costs. \nSPEAKER_01:  These funding projections become the basis for charges to departments. In any given year, the actual cash that is expended from the fund may be different from the funding collected due to timing of when claims and losses actually occur, and when the settlements or judgments occur and cash is paid out. In general, any over funding or underfunding in a year will help inform adjustments to charges in future years, with the intent that over time the charges and costs will be balanced. \nSPEAKER_01:  Currently the Workers Comp Fund has a healthy fund available status, so in the next few slides we'll be focusing on the General Liability Fund. \nSPEAKER_01:  The General Library Fund is still experiencing financial difficulties due to past instances of funding levels not covering actual annual costs due to higher than anticipated disbursements for settlements and judgments against the city. For example, in fiscal year's 18 and 19, there was $6 million budgeted each year for judgments and settlements based on previous historical activity. Revenues from the departments and funds were collected accordingly for these assumed cost levels. However, in fiscal year 18, there was $15.2 million in settlements and judgments. And in fiscal year 19, there was $27.2 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  These trends and associated increased costs were industry-wide and not unique to Long Beach. However, they had a negative impact on the funds financial status. \nSPEAKER_01:  The budgetary funds available for the General Liability Fund decreased from a positive $7 million at the end of fiscal year 18 to a negative $18 million at the end of fiscal year 20. This was a $25 million decrease in two years. \nSPEAKER_01:  In order to mitigate this issue, we increased general liability department collection rates for fiscal year 21 and again for fiscal year 22. These collection rates were projected to rebuild the status of the fund over time. \nSPEAKER_01:  These increased rates had a significant impact on the city's funds, especially with the general fund paying for 58% of the general liability costs. This resulted in a $6.8 million increase in general fund costs for fiscal year 22. While these increases were difficult for all the funds, it was an important step to bringing the general liability fund back to healthy financial status. \nSPEAKER_01:  In fiscal year 21, with the higher collection rates, the fund improved by about $5 million. Fiscal year 22 is projected to continue to improve. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the fiscal year 23 collection rates have stayed the same as fiscal year 22. We believe that this rate will still allow for the funds available to continue to grow and return to an appropriate level for the fund without further increasing costs to the other funds such as the general fund. \nSPEAKER_01:  So in summary, the insurance market is currently very challenging. The city has experienced a sharp increase in claims and judgments, as well as property insurance costs. Large payouts for losses and increase in premiums have had an impact on the financial status of the General Liability Fund, and we are working to build back the fund to a reasonable level of cash and budgetary funds available. \nSPEAKER_01:  As we move forward, risk management will continue to work with the departments to find opportunities to reduce risk and liability, and financial management will continue to monitor and report on the fund status. \nSPEAKER_01:  This concludes our presentation and we're available for any questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I wanted to far too much. \nSPEAKER_05:  colleagues, anybody?
