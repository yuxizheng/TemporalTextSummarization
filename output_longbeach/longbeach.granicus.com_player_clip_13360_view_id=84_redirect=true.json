        "transcript": "SPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  April, who's going to introduce the people that are going to speak on the next item? \nSPEAKER_06:  I will do that, Chair. So next we have item number two, which is a recommendation to receive a follow-up presentation on the Family Disclosure Policy and we'll have Fred and then also Ramon from Human Resources. \nSPEAKER_06:  and they do have a presentation. \nSPEAKER_06:  There we go. \nSPEAKER_05:  Good afternoon commissioners. \nSPEAKER_05:  For every new go on the deputy charge director, I will be giving the presentation for the appointment of immediate family members and family members of the \nSPEAKER_05:  by city, employed by city contractors. \nSPEAKER_05:  Today I'm joined by with Ramon Garcia. \nSPEAKER_05:  He is the human resources officer over there. \nSPEAKER_05:  EEO and training division. \nSPEAKER_05:  Before I present the contents of the AR, I would like to just note that in preparing for the presentation and reviewing the policy that it is an outdated policy. And so there are some processes that are unclear and also \nSPEAKER_05:  they're not aligned with our current city processes or policies and so \nSPEAKER_05:  I will be going over that in the presentation and trying to identify those things, but really addressing that in the conclusion of the presentation and the next step's portion. \nSPEAKER_05:  That being said, I'll start the presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  So as part of the overview of the presentation, I'll go over to the purpose of the AR, the language of the city charter, the scope. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then I'll get into the regulation, which is \nSPEAKER_05:  broken down into four categories, classified service, non-career and unclassified, and also contractors, and also spouses. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the purpose of the AR is to clarify and expand on Section 511 of the City Charter, which is a 1980 revised edition. \nSPEAKER_05:  So this section 5-11, which is out of the city charter, is appointment of immediate family members void. So it really covers a couple things. It defines what the family definition of immediate family. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it also says any appointments made in violation of this policy is void. \nSPEAKER_05:  So no officer commission or member of commission of the city shall recommend the appointment of \nSPEAKER_05:  a point vote or elected to office the position employment and the department of the city government and Andy \nSPEAKER_05:  members of set officers, commission members, immediate family member. \nSPEAKER_05:  So one of the differences in this section and in the policy AR32-1 is that \nSPEAKER_05:  There is a section that is not included in the policy, which is \nSPEAKER_05:  any person who regularly cohabitates. \nSPEAKER_05:  with or uses the Domosol of SAID Officer or Commission member. \nSPEAKER_05:  as a resident. So \nSPEAKER_05:  That's also included in there and so we would have to revise the policy to incorporate that language. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the scope of the policy is all city departments and offices responsible directly to the city manager. So it is also requested that elective office and independent offices and departments comply with the policy. So in section. \nSPEAKER_05:  Section 500 of the city charter. It defines \nSPEAKER_05:  what the department heads and also officers are included in this section. I'll go over that a little bit more in the next section. \nSPEAKER_05:  So in the in the sport of the regulation. \nSPEAKER_05:  recommending us pointing in their own department. \nSPEAKER_05:  For classified service, no management employee shall appoint or recommend appointment of any member of their immediate family member as classified employee of any department office bureau. \nSPEAKER_05:  or division which they have administrative control over. \nSPEAKER_05:  For the purposes of this regulation, appointment shall be liberally construed. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that the immediate family member department will be employed within that department, even if the management employee does not personally sign the letters of official forms, which constitute the appointment. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the other section is recommending to another department. So no management employee shall recommend the appointment of a member of their immediate family member. \nSPEAKER_05:  or another management employee to the city. This regulation permits. \nSPEAKER_05:  Family members and manager employees to be appointed as classified in any department over \nSPEAKER_05:  The related management employee has no administrative control. So long as management employee makes no recommendation or otherwise attempts to influence such appointment. \nSPEAKER_05:  Next section is non-career unclassified Oracle management position. So in this section, no management employee shall appoint a member. \nSPEAKER_05:  of their immediate family member to non-career, classified, clerical, or management positions in their department or recommend appointment in their department in another city department. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, appointments to these unclassified positions of immediate family members of another. \nSPEAKER_05:  Management employee can be made only when it is clear there's no potential conflict of interest created by the appointment. \nSPEAKER_05:  These recommendations for appointment have to be reviewed by the director of human resources prior to the hire. So in this case, we did survey the departments and we did not find, we only had two examples of these kind of requests coming through and they did follow the process. They submitted a memo to the HR director. It was reviewed, making sure that there was no control over these employees and they were ultimately approved. \nSPEAKER_05:  Under no circumstances will imagine employee in a position of authority to control the employment circumstances, including performance evaluations of the immediate family members. So this is part of the criteria and assessment that we do make before. It's given to the HR director for approval. \nSPEAKER_09:  What is a non-career unclassified clerical? Can you explain that a little more? Because I don't think we understand that. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  terminology. \nSPEAKER_05:  So a non-career. \nSPEAKER_05:  classification does not have a \nSPEAKER_05:  is not covered under the merit system. They don't have rights as a permanent status employee like civil service rights. They also don't get all the benefits that a full time employee gets. And it's limited in hours. So that's kind of the major difference in it. \nSPEAKER_05:  The next section is contractors and business dealings with the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  So no management employee shall recommend or attempt to influence any contractor or business which has a business relationship with the city to employ a member of their immediate family. \nSPEAKER_05:  Disclosure of economic interest must be disclosed on the required interest filings in addition. Disclosure of such employment by a contractor or a business dealing with the city not required to be disclosed on economic interest filing shall be disclosed in writing with the department or the city manager as appropriate upon each such employment. So I did reach out to procurement on the RFP process for contractors and what I was advised is that in the RFP the proposals must disclose there's a stipulation in the RFP where they must disclose any conflict of interest and that will be reviewed at that time. \nSPEAKER_05:  The next action is employment of spouses. \nSPEAKER_05:  So unemployment decisions shall not be based on whether an individual has a spouse presently employed by the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  for business reasons of supervision, safety, security, or morale. \nSPEAKER_05:  as determined by the city manager. No spouse shall be appointed or promoted into a position. \nSPEAKER_05:  in any department in which the other spouse would be placed in an employment relationship which either would have the capacity or authority to control the employment circumstances or one spouse would be in a position to audit or evaluate the performance of the other. \nSPEAKER_05:  where a potential conflict or other hazards greater than married couples than other persons. \nSPEAKER_05:  if an employee marries another employee in the same department. \nSPEAKER_05:  Both employees shall be allowed to retain their respective positions provided that no supervisory relationship exists. If a supervisor relationship exists, the least senior employee shall be transferred to a comparable position if available in another department. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  I hate to interrupt you again, but I see questioning looks to senior mean time and position or senior in terms of the classifications that they hold \nSPEAKER_05:  So typically in the classified service it would be \nSPEAKER_05:  the time in the position, if there's a tie breaker then they go to like the higher, the higher date of the employee. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, so in this case, if somebody gets married, and they've been in their position to say a clerk marries a supervisor. \nSPEAKER_09:  And there's a supervisory relationship there. And the clerk's been in position for five years. And the supervisor's been in position for two years. The clerk's going to stay in their position. And the supervisor's going to have to move. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, I wish I had a real life situation. I did research. It's just what we've done in the past, but we would evaluate that based on this language and see. \nSPEAKER_05:  And yeah, the most senior will retain the position based on this language, but we don't like I couldn't find a situation where where they had a curve and how was practice. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  I just saw questioning looks from my fellow commissioners as to what does senior name. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  and I can do some additional research on that as well. \nSPEAKER_09:  That would be great. \nSPEAKER_11:  Eric, can I ask a clarifying question too? So, classified employees, I just want to make sure you've explained who are not the non-career employees. Am I, is it fair to understand that classified employees are pretty much all city staff with a few exceptions except for the ones that you identified that are exempt or clerical? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I think in the latest numbers that I looked at, \nSPEAKER_05:  It's pretty similar. It's not it's not on \nSPEAKER_05:  I wouldn't say it's 80-20, I would say more, it's like 60-40, so there is a lot of unclassified positions in the city. \nSPEAKER_11:  So what would be examples of the, well, you've already identified your prior response, you provided examples of unclassified. Are the classified more senior employees within this city? \nSPEAKER_05:  No, I wouldn't know. \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't have that data with me right now, but I mean that we have long-term employees. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  So when you... \nSPEAKER_05:  another unclassified. \nSPEAKER_09:  another one. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll see you in the next video. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  So your question is, are management employees classified? \nSPEAKER_11:  expect somebody who will give advice to three people at Griffin. She told us a while ago that I had a last warning for her 2<|en|> \nSPEAKER_08:  No. \nSPEAKER_11:  No, they're... \nSPEAKER_08:  So it's the lower level employees that are usually in the classification system. And then once employees reach to a management level, that's when this policy would start to apply. They are typically \nSPEAKER_08:  at will and then some of them are appointed so like \nSPEAKER_08:  The clerk for instance, that goes through the council and the mayor to unappoint those positions, but those aren't considered classified either. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, I'll wait. In reviewing the documentation earlier, I thought it was a question I had. I was struggling to really understand who was who. But let's proceed and then I'll see if I understand. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  but on the same issue. So I heard non-career \nSPEAKER_12:  or not full time. So that would like best example I can think of of a non-career is like a lifeguard, right? \nSPEAKER_12:  And is that the universe of the non-classified, you've got management, put them over here, then under management classified and non-classified, non-classified or either non-career or not full time. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, we do have. \nSPEAKER_05:  full time on classified positions. \nSPEAKER_08:  So sometimes those positions are like for temporary projects. Like the staff member that oversaw redistricting, that was not a classified position. It was for a temporary amount of time. I know some of the cannabis staff in the beginning similar. It's a temporary project initially. City doesn't have funding for a continued period of time. So that position doesn't necessarily go through. \nSPEAKER_08:  The civil service process, those people are typically just hired. Is that helpful? \nSPEAKER_08:  There are a lot of pools of employees. \nSPEAKER_00:  It could be complicated. I'll give you my example, my own experience. I started off as a non-currier administrative analyst. So my hours were limited. I then became a permanent, unclassified employee. \nSPEAKER_00:  in a different classification. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then I tested, took the admin analyst exam, tested for it past, and then became a classified employee as an administrative analyst. And then when I promoted to officer, I became unclassified. So you could have a classification, such as administrative analyst, in both classified and unclassified or non-career and classified and unclassified. It just depends. When I was unclassified or a non-career, it was a grant funded program in economic development. \nSPEAKER_00:  So it's very complicated that it's not one single definition for a certain classification. \nSPEAKER_00:  and advent analysts can be non-career, unclassified or classified. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  a place to decide \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  That was basically the question I was going to get to. If a unit asks for a position, I'm presuming in the budget you asked for a position, and it has to go to a group that looks at the classification to see if the job duties align with what you're asking for. And in looking at how the position is going to be. \nSPEAKER_09:  used, how is the determination made whether it's classified or unclassified outside of the management structure? I think we kind of all understand management being unclassified and at will. But when you get into the larger pool of employees who do staff work, how is the determination made whether it's classified or unclassified? And you may not be prepared to discuss that with us today. But if it's something that you could bring back to us, I think it would be very helpful for us. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I can give you an example. One is that it would have to go through the Civil Service Commission. So if a department and typically \nSPEAKER_05:  They would request, you know, in the budget process an additional FTE depend. And usually we look at the classifications and make sure, okay, this aligns. And this is part of our operations team would review it with the department looking at if the duties are fine, align with a classification already existing. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that's how it would work. But in some cases, \nSPEAKER_05:  There have been, if a department has a temporary \nSPEAKER_05:  grant or a temporary project where we need kind of a temporary workforce. They can go to commission and request a classification and a classified service to be unclassified and they would make a determination and approval. \nSPEAKER_09:  So then is it fair to say that at the staff level, classified versus unclassified depends on if you're a recurrent or a temporary employee versus a permanent employee? And given that, using April's example of a lifeguard, you could have a lifeguard who comes back every year, but they only work X number of hours through the summer. So they're not classified because you're going to let them go at the end of the season. \nSPEAKER_09:  But then you'll bring them back if they're interested in coming back. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, they're seasonal. And so they're back on a seasonal basis. \nSPEAKER_05:  grant funding or uncertain funding also plays a role in that and so like in the health department They get a lot of grants and so a lot of their positions are unclassified because they don't know the 10 year of the grant or when it's gonna The program will be exhausted. So those positions are classified unclassified \nSPEAKER_08:  So it may be helpful to think there's, typically three times that that happens. Time, money, or specific roles and responsibilities that it would change and dictate why it's moving between classification and unclassified. \nSPEAKER_12:  Is it the Civil Service Commission who makes the decision? Is that what I heard? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, they would be yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  So like if we were establishing a new classified classification, we would still have to go through commission to get approval. \nSPEAKER_11:  Taylor, I just, I realized the error of my ways. When I was doing the pre-read, I had failed to pick up on management positions being womped in with non-classified and non-career. And so I was like looking where is management. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I don't know if I'll go with any time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so this takes me to my next step. So we are in HR, we are currently, we have an initiative to update policy. So we are working on that as a general \nSPEAKER_05:  as a general standard. \nSPEAKER_05:  But in this case, we will complete a thorough review of the policy and language and making sure that it aligns with the charter and also the city practices. \nSPEAKER_05:  Our plan is to create a work flow administering this policy and creating a management acknowledging acknowledgement or attestation form for this AR. \nSPEAKER_05:  And also creating a training that communicates the duties and responsibilities to managers, as part of a supervisory academy that the EEO office and the training section is working on. So we are going to work on addressing some of these issues. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so that concludes my presentation. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes, thank you Fred. I have a quick question. \nSPEAKER_10:  reviewing the presentation I saw a requirement to disclose economic interests specifically kind of while you were discussing contractors and business dealings. Is there any other requirement to disclose in a regular employment context and I'll give an example if a person is applying for employment at the city in department A and their uncle works in department B. Is there any requirement for the job applicant to disclose the fact that their uncle works in a different department? I've seen some language about recommending for appointment but no sort of simple disclosure requirement because what I'm getting at is it's hard to know whether somebody is advocating or recommending for somebody somebody to be employed at the city if you don't know or you're pursuant to this policy at least if you don't know that they are related in the first place. So is there any sort of initial disclosure requirement for a job applicant? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, in reviewing this AR, I did not come across that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  in the scenario where there's \nSPEAKER_05:  collateral employment. We do evaluate a conflict of interest that way but \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  as an employee or an applicant and ultimately candidate that has a relative. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  in the city there isn't. \nSPEAKER_05:  I did not come across anything that would have them disclose that in some way. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. And only other question I have is I think one of the other commissioners raised this at the last meeting. This presentation focuses on people who qualify under the language immediate family. Is there any similar policy for cronyism? So friends, close associates and the similar type of influence and recommendations that somebody can make to have those people appointed even if they are not necessarily meeting the definition of immediate family. \nSPEAKER_09:  I sure feel I don't know if you had a chance to look at your email earlier today. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's great, so we're going Back again, so we'll be little friends! For facilities first. Well, Ivory. Visit the hotel to get to know K \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Taylor sent out a list of all of the city's policies related to disclosure. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Forgive me. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's okay. That's okay. Went out early this morning and we all have busy lives. But she sent that out after a discussion with the Vice-Chair and I because we know that all of you have concerns about the breath of the policies and that way you'll have some time over the next month or so. \nSPEAKER_09:  as long as you want to take a look at the various policies and if there's something that you specifically or any of the other commissioners would like to have a presentation on just let myself or Taylor know and we'll get that scheduled. \nSPEAKER_08:  I can just continue with what the chair said. Charter Section 511 is the closest that the city gets and this policy to something similar to Chronyism. \nSPEAKER_08:  Charter section 511, which is included in the packet that got sent today. And I forgive you, it was like 200 pages long. So we did not expect you guys to read that today. We're just trying to get it to you quickly. \nSPEAKER_10:  was not aware that 5-11 is \nSPEAKER_08:  It's okay, it's okay. So 5.11 interestingly enough actually includes \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  So. \nSPEAKER_08:  Any person who regularly cohabitates or uses the same domicile as an officer or commission member as their residents, that is the only area that we were able to find that covers something close to cronyism. It's not, I think. \nSPEAKER_08:  directly what you were looking for, so we don't have a direct policy on point, but these two are the closest in the realm to cronism of what you were looking for. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, got it. \nSPEAKER_09:  Vishnell Weiss. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_06:  Could you just speak a little closer to the microphone just to make sure it's captured? \nSPEAKER_03:  Can't hear her. \nSPEAKER_02:  So first of all, when was 5-11 amended to include the people living with each other? Is that recent? \nSPEAKER_08:  It was adopted in 1987. And from what I can tell based off of the public facing programming and the research of my internal program, there has been no amendment of this policy since it was adopted in 1987. I also had a difficult time finding the paperwork on why it was adopted and what was driving it. We did try to look into that. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  So we don't unfortunately have that context because it was adopted so long ago. \nSPEAKER_02:  And when was the administrative regulation 32-1 adopted? I didn't see a date on it, but maybe I missed it. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not sure that we have that information. I can tell you it is an older policy based off of the little smoke stack building and wave logo, which was a couple city logos ago. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  but it was subsequent to. \nSPEAKER_02:  to \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, it was in response to this policy as well, and I believe to clarify. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  for staff how the policy was to apply. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. And then my other question was, I know that the administrative regulation \nSPEAKER_02:  says straight out that it just applies to the people or the departments that are you know overseen by the city manager. But the section of the charter 511 applies to everybody that works in the city, right? That is correct. So in theory the questions, the presentation that we've received from the city manager, this commission could ask other departments that aren't subject to the city manager whether they have a policy about this that explains it to their employees. \nSPEAKER_08:  We could check with the independent departments if they have a similar policy. Yes. The commission could. \nSPEAKER_02:  Well, I'm just thinking that going forward, especially when we're going to do education of people that it might be useful to find out what the other departments have said and how they're saying it or whatever because we might. \nSPEAKER_02:  It seems to me it should be somewhat universal in how 5-11 applies regardless of what the department you're in. \nSPEAKER_08:  So 5-11 applies in the same way to everybody. \nSPEAKER_08:  If the departments want to elect to go further, they have the opportunity to do so and could do that if the city manager department and then the independent departments as well or appointed. \nSPEAKER_08:  at the very least 5-11 applies to everybody, so they wouldn't necessarily need to adopt a policy because everyone is expected to comply with this charter section. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then my other question was, I understand that there's going to be a rework of this regulation or one's in progress. That's what the last, the next steps are about. Is there a timetable for doing that? I mean, should, if we wanted to know when to ask about this in the future, when would be a reasonable time to do that? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  So this is something that April and I are working with each of the departments. Every administer regulation has a lead department associated with it. So right now I'm working on with financial management. They have a lot of administer regulations and then the next apartment that'll be kind of starting up with as well. Prelling to FM AR policies is HR. So right now we don't have a specific anticipated deadline for progress of AR 32-1. But the recommendations can be provided. So when that time does come we can make sure we have those available to... \nSPEAKER_06:  look at as we look at 32-1. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's clear that the vendor, the rules regarding vendors, you know, are like the other side of some of the same rules that we're asking for the employees. I mean, we want to ask the vendors to disclose whether they have anybody working for them that are in these departments or sitting on the dias, voting on the contractor, whatever. At the same time, we want the people sitting on the dias or involved in getting the contracts to disclose it. So there is some... \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, it's two sides of the same coin if you will. So, okay. We'll keep us posted. Thank you. Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_12:  So 5-11 doesn't include the prohibition or the oversight that 32-1 has on a spouse or other member of the immediate family who's working for a potential contractor. If I understand correctly, that comes out of 32-1. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I believe all of these at this time would need to be reported in order for the city to be aware that there was a violation of the policy or the charter. \nSPEAKER_08:  So it would, it's similar to other enforcement actions where that someone would need, like my office or HR would need to be made aware that there was a violation of this policy and that there was an inappropriate relationship under 511 or AR32-1. \nSPEAKER_12:  But I don't think 5'11 says that \nSPEAKER_12:  a city officer subject to 5-11 can't have a spouse who works for a potential contractor. \nSPEAKER_08:  That's a different issue. \nSPEAKER_12:  Yeah, that's the issue. OK. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, that's a different issue and it's not addressed by this section. \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_12:  So they're not co extensive. 32-1 and 5-11. 5-11 is focused on employment only. And 32-1 is employment both in the city and the city. \nSPEAKER_12:  city contractors. That is correct. \nSPEAKER_08:  That is correct. \nSPEAKER_12:  Would it be possible when when I know there's a couple of questions outstanding? Could I get a copy of the RFP certification that a contractor has to make under 32-1? \nSPEAKER_12:  at what said I, the whole commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, we can, I can just a financial management and see what documentation they have. That may be part of the kind of the bullet print language that they receive as part of that. So I'll look into that a community get to be. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  mission and know where \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Chair. Thank you for the presentation. I'm just curious. Is there... \nSPEAKER_01:  for lack of a better way to illustrate. \nSPEAKER_01:  a system of checks and balances. \nSPEAKER_01:  So when there's an appointment, \nSPEAKER_01:  by department. \nSPEAKER_01:  is HR the only level. \nSPEAKER_01:  a review. \nSPEAKER_01:  My concern is the influence. \nSPEAKER_01:  or the control. \nSPEAKER_01:  or coercion. \nSPEAKER_01:  by a department head. \nSPEAKER_01:  to a point. \nSPEAKER_01:  or to favor \nSPEAKER_01:  placement of a relative. \nSPEAKER_01:  in a position. \nSPEAKER_01:  So aside from HR. \nSPEAKER_01:  being the A level of review, is there another level of review? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, and the situations that we have, it's the Department and administrative officer reaching out to HR in consultation. \nSPEAKER_05:  of whatever the relationship is and us assessing the \nSPEAKER_05:  the \nSPEAKER_05:  either the controller or lack of control that the individual would have over it. \nSPEAKER_05:  the family member, potential family member, and \nSPEAKER_05:  really HR would make that decision if we had questions we would consult the city attorney's office. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Make sure to shop well. \nSPEAKER_11:  You follow up questions. So one, well, actually going off of what Commissioner Norvey just asked about, is there a \nSPEAKER_11:  Is there any one area of the city that manages a \nSPEAKER_11:  a AR, a tickler or AR status update to make sure that to keep track of just how recently ARs have been reviewed and they're more appropriately to put them on a cycle so that they are reviewed say no less than every three years. Is there any central management process in all that line? I also don't think you have a central process for approval. I think the answer to the question was that those are all done by the individual departments. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I can take a good stab at that. So yeah, April, and I noticed that that needed some of the ARs needed updating, which is kind of what we've initiated this project. You know, we'll say this working on this in the past month or so, it's easy going to be a multi-year project, but our goal is to have them on a timetable where they are reviewed in a reasonable number of years as things are always changing. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the second part is that AR1 is basically the initial administrative regulation that describes how an AR is created and routed. So it has to go through just as an example. When we look at this AR and there is some change to it, it will have to be routed through human resources, of course, or any related to relevant department as well as the attorney's office and the city manager because it governs the city manager department, it will be over the signature of the city manager at the end. So there is a prescribed process for it, but there is no, right now, yet, a timetable for recurring reviews of that, and that's something that we \nSPEAKER_06:  will have though at the end of this project. \nSPEAKER_06:  and we will update the old logo as well Taylor. \nSPEAKER_11:  are all the ARs where can employees find the ARs? They have to go to each and every department to find the ARs or can they go to a central repository. I mean, I'm just concerned with like the AR that we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_11:  How do employees even have notice of where they is, have awareness? Do they even know that they have these requirements? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, so ARs are available in the internet and they're also our public. They're made public online. However, we do agree with you that, you know, it is a policy. So it's many times hard for the public. We've been set to really understand what is saying. So, \nSPEAKER_06:  Heather and I have kind of been talking about as part of the education process, maybe making something like a one-page or a quick one-minute video of what this AR policy is. You know, I will be honest, that's something that's maybe more down the line once they're reviewed, but that's something that we, that is on our, on our minds to address and make it more accessible. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  And we are Commissioner Schottweil looking into how we might be able to take a look at the internet so that we have a better idea of what staff have at their fingertips. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you for that. I appreciate that. And so these questions are more your other project that you're now starting now. So thank you for that to the extent. So I have some more ideas with regard to that later. But with regard to this particular policy or AR, is there any form of an exception process? So it is in the city's best interest that they can't afford not to have the two individuals not in the roles that they need them in. So is there any form of an exception process? And then mitigation procedures that can be put in place to solve that conflict over time. Number one and number two to put controls in place to make sure that there's no inappropriate supervision. But I can envision some cases in which it's in the city's best interest not to lose key talent in key roles. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I can speak to 511 in the charter. There are no exceptions. \nSPEAKER_08:  The minute that appointment is done and if it's in violation of this section, it's void. \nSPEAKER_08:  So anything... \nSPEAKER_08:  outside of the scope of 511 has the potential in AR32-1, but I don't believe there's an exception in that policy either. \nSPEAKER_11:  I did not see one or another. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, you have not practiced any exceptions. So as part of if it was elevated to the HR director, we would ensure that that employment relationship or control over the employee, the performance of this employee would not occur. So, \nSPEAKER_05:  We have not practiced any type of exceptions on that. \nSPEAKER_11:  So in some cases, I guess you would expect termination of one employee or the other. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're hoping it's coming as part of the initial hire, so we would not approve the hire. \nSPEAKER_11:  I can envision sometimes where individuals are getting, you know. \nSPEAKER_11:  beginning married or develop in these relationships when they're enrolled. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Remember he said that they will try to move somebody to another department. \nSPEAKER_11:  I remember I've disowned certain that it's always possible. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  in the other corner. \nSPEAKER_09:  Oh, I'm sorry, the commissioner did not edit this. \nSPEAKER_03:  You couldn't get away with that. Thank you, Fred. I appreciate your presentation. I have a couple questions on the disclosure process. So is that in the employment application when the employee discloses any family or personal relationships? \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sorry, I didn't catch the beginning of that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Any, when does the disclosure \nSPEAKER_03:  requested at the time of employment prior to higher when what's the process is is it part of the employment application something they certify to \nSPEAKER_05:  So, so it's... \nSPEAKER_05:  It's not. I didn't come across that part in the application process. Right. The manager. There's a manager, existing manager. They would have to disclose that. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  I haven't, I did try and see just kind of survey the departments to see if that has come up and I didn't have any examples because then I would have tried to track down what process how we could have caught that if that occurred. Right. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then how about subsequent disclosures? Is it just a duty to disclose? Or are you catching it at a life event? What's the best way for you guys to catch those? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, it would be a kind of a duty to disclose. So it's part of our review of the policy, the deeper data that we would have to take. We would have to ensure that those mechanisms are in place to be able to catch that. We did talk a little bit about \nSPEAKER_05:  also including \nSPEAKER_05:  some information in our new employee orientation to also include that. \nSPEAKER_05:  But we do want to incorporate it for a manager, manager level positions because they're the ones recommending appointments. \nSPEAKER_05:  that there is some sort of acknowledgement or a test station form. \nSPEAKER_05:  as part of the supervisor academy or when they move into those positions that they sign off and acknowledge the requirements of the policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  As you go through the process of revisiting this, I encourage you to take a look at benchmarking, whether it be other city government or even private practice, the concept of family members, personal relationships, people with whom you cohabitate, and even business dealings. These are all fair game in the employment process. The duty to disclose and then letting them know that if anything changes, it's substantively that that duty holds. It's a good time to catch it. I don't know if your HRIS systems can carry that through, but then that also that the manager, when they fill a position that they have done their due diligence, you'll save yourself a lot of work later. Should the employee fail to disclose later? I wanted to ask about the I-2 I'm interested, as Commissioner Pollock, about the contractor vetting on that same area. Then I would also encourage you to work with Heather. If you should choose so, we were looking to the ethics officer to help with training in the area of conflict of interest. I think some milieu and personal relationships is problematic here in the city. Regardless of the, I know we talked about the different roles and the different types of employment, but it would be a goal in a better bar than just mere compliance to get to where everybody is thinking along these lines. Whether it's the nephew who's performing as a lifeguard or a different role. I know that we are hoping that Heather will train to these types of concepts. That way your organization isn't overwhelmed when I think once training begins, perhaps the calls may come. And also to utilize HR and ethics traditionally partner on the vetting of conflict of interest, especially in personal relationships. It may be helpful for an independent set, rather than just relying on the hiring manager, the requesting organization. \nSPEAKER_03:  And again, I think both you, Fred and Ramon, for presenting to us today very much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Anyone else have any other questions? \nSPEAKER_09:  So I'd like to spend a few minutes on the hiring process because I hear the concern of my colleagues. \nSPEAKER_09:  in \nSPEAKER_09:  even \nSPEAKER_09:  So unclassified and classified positions. Do unclassified positions go through an exam process similar to classified? And can you explain to me how the exam process works in the city? Because I have a concept having come from the government agency that I come from, where there is a review of resumes to make sure that the candidate meets the minimum qualifications before they come in for a standardized interview. And every candidate gets asked the same questions. Those questions are held very, very closely and under lock and key. They weren't always. And that's how we had a problem with nepotism in one department. But based on those questions, they then get a rank score. And they end up in one of five bands. As a hiring manager, I could only, if there were five or more people in band one, I couldn't look at anyone in a lower band. Does the city have a similar process? \nSPEAKER_08:  So before we get into this conversation, \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Oh, we didn't do it in Brown Act it did we? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, I just... \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_08:  I think it would be better if we came back and had a robust presentation on how the city's process works. Okay. One under the brown act. I know it's frustrating under this policy and our apologies that we didn't anticipate. And I didn't think it either, so mine. No, no, no, you're fine. And your question is logical. I'm just concerned. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  part of it. \nSPEAKER_09:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's if you give them out a cookie. Okay, we're gonna. And I wanna make sure to that we can have civil service if they need to be here to explain what their process is. \nSPEAKER_08:  to make sure that you guys completely understand how it works and that we have all the right people in the room. \nSPEAKER_08:  on. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think it's the brown act part two if that's okay with you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, no, it makes sense. But I think that goes hand in hand with the disclosure, because I think if we have a full understanding, and I have a think a different perspective than my other colleagues, because I know that as long as those exams where I used to work were tightly held, it was very hard to get to somebody that a family, somebody's friend or family may have recommended them, if they didn't have the skill set. \nSPEAKER_09:  to actually score high enough on an exam to be qualified. So I think that's part of the concern here is that you may have unqualified candidates being appointed to positions because of the fact that they know somebody in the city. So I think, yeah, I think if we can go into the hiring process and how the exams run, I think that dovetails nicely with this. \nSPEAKER_09:  So, no, I'm not going to be on the next agenda setting if you guys could talk about maybe seeing William if you could see a civil service that come to our next meeting \nSPEAKER_08:  So what we could do to is agendaize it to allow a further discussion in light of that new information of this policy in particular for the commission. Sure. Once you have all of the pieces of information that you need. Okay. Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  And I'd like that to also cover the non-classified. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I think the bet from what I'm hearing is the best thing would be to provide you information and all the types of Employees that the city has to offer so that you can understand What each of the bubbles are and how they interact with each other because I think without that information \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  you don't have the appropriate information to \nSPEAKER_08:  to understand this policy. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Exactly. Okay. Exactly. Does that make sense to everybody? Okay. Okay. And then I think if we could just do a motion to receive and file this, you have the information on some of the other policies that are going to dovetail. Like I said, just let. \nSPEAKER_09:  because I'm not going to be here for a while if you could let just copy Bobby on any mail. She said to me that way she can let staff know what's going to come up or the vice-charm start of all. \nSPEAKER_06:  And you're always welcome to include me in those emails as well. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  So if there's something you'd like to see addressed and you make it through everything before October meeting send an email to me with a copy to Vice Chair Pollock and Hullian. \nSPEAKER_09:  I have a motion, I need a second. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Can you call for the? The joint appeal. Sorry, do we have any public comment? \nSPEAKER_07:  Did you want to take it? \nSPEAKER_07:  At this time, if you'd like to speak on this item in the Zoom meeting, please hit the raise and feature. \nSPEAKER_07:  seeing none that concludes the public comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  We're voting Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_07:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  The next item is a recommendation to adopt a resolution amending the rules and procedures of the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  to include a commission disclosure policy and the campaign contribution policy which was previously adopted by the commission. Taylor, are you going to lead us on this or is Commissioner shot well? \nSPEAKER_00:  I have volunteered to lead you on this one. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Since you asked me to make some changes, so I'll walk you through a little refresher of what I did. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the copy of the commission's rules and regulations includes two things. It includes \nSPEAKER_00:  You're campaign contribution policy that was adopted as a separate resolution quite some time ago. And then it includes the disclosure policy right after that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I made some, I made eight weeks. \nSPEAKER_00:  two \nSPEAKER_00:  It's on page 16 to section D to make the language consistent in D1, D2 and D3, D1. \nSPEAKER_00:  was worded a little bit differently. The commission had asked for that to be fixed. So those are the changes that were made. So if you adopt \nSPEAKER_00:  this policy as it's written. \nSPEAKER_00:  that will become the commission's policy. If you want to make changes to it, you can absolutely do that by motion and consent of the entire commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  four. \nSPEAKER_00:  you can make no changes to it. So, completely up to you. I'm available for questions if you have any. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Anyone have any questions? \nSPEAKER_07:  Any questions? \nSPEAKER_07:  JP in our commission to shout well sorry \nSPEAKER_04:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  There was one change I think we talked about the last meeting. I'm sorry I didn't catch it earlier, but is the in the we had used the term written. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think we meant to change that to print printed because you know it right currently on line 17 to page 16 it says copies of written or electronic \nSPEAKER_04:  contacts and I think we were a electronic contract. Contact is also written, so I think we meant to say print it. \nSPEAKER_00:  That is a simple correction that I can make. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we can make that change on the floor. I apologize for not making that change. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  but it doesn't change the substance of what you're trying to adopt, so we don't need to bring the resolution back. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I have a couple more things I want to bring up as I think I did in. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a couple more things that I want to bring up, similar to what I've done in previous discussions on this, examples of situations that I think could come up, and in this case, have come up in the last couple of weeks that I think we need to think about how they would fit into this policy as it's currently worded. And maybe the, forgive me if some of these have been covered before I don't think they have exactly, and maybe the subcommittee when they were working on it thought about these things. But just for example, I think that's a great question. \nSPEAKER_01:  shortly after the City Council agenda was posted. \nSPEAKER_01:  I got a phone call from a reporter who wanted me to talk about and give a reaction to the code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  So I notified \nSPEAKER_01:  the chair and staff that this had happened and we \nSPEAKER_01:  We worked through it and I said at the time, I think this might be required for me to disclose it. And I assume the reporter is being paid by his employer for calling me. \nSPEAKER_01:  But it made me think about whether that was a good thing or a bad thing and whether \nSPEAKER_01:  and how we want this policy to affect \nSPEAKER_01:  or our conduct or conduct of others, including the press in terms of \nSPEAKER_01:  relating to our \nSPEAKER_01:  the work of our commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can tell you from experience on other commissions. \nSPEAKER_01:  This has never been the case here, but if we had a controversial item in front of us, it is possible. This was, my experience was pre-COVID, but it is possible that there would be reporters in the audience. And as we came out of the meeting, they would approach and they would want our comments and say we had voted four to three. They would want us to say something. And so I think we need as a group to talk about how we would handle this. \nSPEAKER_01:  first just because it may happen because some of the things we get into as we go through our work plan could be somewhat controversial may not agree on them all. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then the other thing is how it relates to this policy. And if we want to think about that in connection with this policy before we... \nSPEAKER_01:  Adapted. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's one example. The other example. \nSPEAKER_01:  is \nSPEAKER_01:  in there. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not sure how to put this in the subcommittee work that we're doing on lab being. \nSPEAKER_01:  We received a suggestion. \nSPEAKER_01:  that perhaps \nSPEAKER_01:  We should try out some of our ideas on members of the City Council before we suggested them. \nSPEAKER_01:  to get their temperature. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  that's a process. \nSPEAKER_01:  that I am familiar with in other contexts because a \nSPEAKER_01:  I hope we can see you well. Well thank you, people. Missed your report. Cognition, just five minutes in your time in the \nSPEAKER_01:  You know. \nSPEAKER_01:  people working in other capacities in the city may want to make sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  people in the city know what their department is thinking about doing in the future. So they have those kinds of conversations to see what problems people see with that. So under this, under this. \nSPEAKER_01:  under the way this is worded. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those conversations I do not believe would be excluded from reporting. They're not about budgetary items and they're certainly going to be about items that would come. \nSPEAKER_01:  that would be probably coming before the ethics commission for discussion. So is it our \nSPEAKER_01:  intention to report those and if it is then \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we have to realize that that then will affect \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  the ability of the commission to get \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm just going to say early information about how some of the things they're thinking about might be received by the electives that have to approve them. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think those are significant communication issues about how our work goes forward that we just need to think through as we, as we, \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, if we adapt this, I think the other examples I had brought up for more what I will call \nSPEAKER_01:  social interactions and interactions with members of the community where we have to make it clear that if they talk to us about what they think about something and it's something that we think the commission would fall within the commission's jurisdiction that then their communication with us will probably get get reported and my understanding was that that was something that the subcommittee intended for for us to do. But I wanted to bring up these other two examples of things that have come up or come to my attention just in the last couple weeks that I think are real, are real possibilities as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to look to Commissioner Fadler and Commissioner Chotwell who were on this ad hoc committee. Yeah. To discuss if that was something. I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm happy to respond. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's my position first. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  the policy just will take \nSPEAKER_03:  both of your hypotheticals. \nSPEAKER_03:  in turn. \nSPEAKER_03:  Similar hypotheticals were discussed by the subcommittee. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  from listening to your description of these two scenarios. \nSPEAKER_03:  My short answer is yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  The longer answer, short answer is yes, they would be contemplated. \nSPEAKER_03:  for disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  by the policy, but let me add a little \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  a bit more of our thinking behind. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, our reasoning. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  I think \nSPEAKER_03:  I think I'm picking up on a theme that there's a \nSPEAKER_03:  concern that \nSPEAKER_03:  any in all communications or you know a large \nSPEAKER_03:  subset of communications with anybody. \nSPEAKER_03:  that we are suddenly bound to \nSPEAKER_03:  disclosed. \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every subjective side. \nSPEAKER_03:  shared by \nSPEAKER_03:  the person with whom we're speaking. So if I run into somebody at a grocery store or to use \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise's examples. \nSPEAKER_03:  social interactions. \nSPEAKER_03:  and somebody says \nSPEAKER_03:  I think they they they oh pine on something that would come within. \nSPEAKER_03:  the purview of our commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't necessarily think. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  the format of disclosure that we put in this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  requires us to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every subjective \nSPEAKER_03:  thought or opinion shared. \nSPEAKER_03:  by the person we spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm looking at page 16. \nSPEAKER_03:  of the handout that \nSPEAKER_00:  And that's it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Taylor circulated. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's subsection B titled Format of Disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have to disclose the name of the group or the individual. \nSPEAKER_03:  When it happened and I'll skip over three and four for a second and then number five. \nSPEAKER_03:  If the person was compensated for the communication so three and four subject matter. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  for short description of any oral context. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is \nSPEAKER_03:  purposely a little bit vague. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  in the spirit of trying to move. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  We understand that this is going to be \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  somewhat dependent on the subjective \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of uh... \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, \nSPEAKER_03:  going to be dependent on the person making the disclosure to sort of \nSPEAKER_03:  determine what qualifies as disclosing the subject matter of the communication and the short description of any oral context. \nSPEAKER_03:  I shared in the subcommittee and I think \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  idea was in in putting forward this policy as written to the whole commission that \nSPEAKER_03:  dead. \nSPEAKER_03:  Subsection three and subsection four do not necessarily require us. \nSPEAKER_03:  to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  that say I ran into somebody at a party. \nSPEAKER_03:  That person said they hate this, they hate that, they wish we did this. \nSPEAKER_03:  differently the city should make these five changes. \nSPEAKER_03:  et cetera. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  We would chill. \nSPEAKER_03:  that person's ability to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  those thoughts if we then just \nSPEAKER_03:  turn around and disclose it verbatim. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that's what this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  contemplates. I think this policy contemplates. \nSPEAKER_03:  something to be effective. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm at a party. \nSPEAKER_03:  ran into Joe Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Joe Smith and I discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know. \nSPEAKER_03:  with a very sort of factual objective description we discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, certain. \nSPEAKER_03:  while being \nSPEAKER_03:  lobbying policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  discuss and maybe you describe those policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  without necessarily describing \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every \nSPEAKER_03:  um, thought or opinion that that person attached. \nSPEAKER_03:  two \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  the subject matter of the context. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  To the extent there's this larger concern about social context. \nSPEAKER_03:  being, you know, \nSPEAKER_03:  people are never going to speak to us about their concerns if they know. \nSPEAKER_03:  that \nSPEAKER_03:  we have to disclose it publicly. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think there is some leeway. \nSPEAKER_03:  to just \nSPEAKER_03:  identify who you spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what you generally spoke about. \nSPEAKER_03:  without having to \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of take any further steps. I think this is simply about disclosing baseline facts. \nSPEAKER_03:  about who went where. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So that \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  soon. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's my first response as to the kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  social contact type of medical that has come up a few times. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  with that said. \nSPEAKER_03:  The second hypothetical did. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise talked about. \nSPEAKER_03:  the suggestion to float certain ideas to a city council person. \nSPEAKER_03:  Same thing applies. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, I think this policy would like \nSPEAKER_03:  to advance. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency in the way that we would \nSPEAKER_03:  in a sense that we would disclose. \nSPEAKER_03:  who you spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  when \nSPEAKER_03:  on what topics. \nSPEAKER_03:  but if that city council person wants the freedom to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  their subjective thoughts on certain policies or ideas that you float to them. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think necessarily that this policy requires YouTube. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just, you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Layout in full. \nSPEAKER_03:  that person's \nSPEAKER_03:  subjective thinking. \nSPEAKER_03:  on those items. It's simply disclosing to the public that I met with \nSPEAKER_03:  Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman \nSPEAKER_03:  Snid. \nSPEAKER_03:  on this day and we spoke about \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, a couple of the \nSPEAKER_03:  ideas, you know, one idea, two idea, three. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think you then need to say Councilman. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  counseling. \nSPEAKER_03:  thought idea one was terrible. \nSPEAKER_03:  thought idea too was great. \nSPEAKER_03:  It, it, it, etc. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Last thing I'll say is the first hypothetical about the \nSPEAKER_03:  phone call from reporter. \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  Looking at Taylor's handout, sub-subsection D, communications where no disclosure is required. \nSPEAKER_03:  on page 16 going into page 17. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Here's a \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of subsection two. \nSPEAKER_03:  Basically, the gist of that is \nSPEAKER_03:  If a contact is not made, \nSPEAKER_03:  the purpose of influencing the decision-making authority of the Commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  you do not need to disclose it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if a reporter calls you and says, \nSPEAKER_03:  comment on something that just came before the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think. \nSPEAKER_03:  that that reporter is contacting you with the purpose of influencing your decision making. \nSPEAKER_03:  the way that we \nSPEAKER_03:  think about somebody who might want to come to us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  actually \nSPEAKER_03:  advance a certain agenda. \nSPEAKER_03:  that then we could. \nSPEAKER_03:  without disclosing to the public. \nSPEAKER_03:  That may influence our vote on a certain agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that the \nSPEAKER_03:  reporter scenario. \nSPEAKER_03:  that Commissioner Wise outlined. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know runs into that issue. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  Whichever subsection D. \nSPEAKER_03:  subsection two of subsection D. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a contact that I think is squarely. \nSPEAKER_03:  outside the \nSPEAKER_03:  the scope of the policy. So those are my thoughts quickly without organizing them. I'm sorry for for taking up time. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know Commissioner Shaw will probably have some thoughts. I'm happy to answer other questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  No need to apologize, Commissioner Feetler, that was very comprehensive and I appreciate your thought process. \nSPEAKER_07:  Let me show you a shot. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I would agree and I think that Commissioner Feele will summarize it very well. \nSPEAKER_04:  I was just going to add that the same concept with regard to the reporter is on kind of the preamble to this particular section. So on page 15 line 25, it's where we're getting across the point. Is this information that we're receiving from an individual in the public or someone as opposed to information that they are providing to us? I do think Commissioner Weiss did raise a concern when she was raising the concern she raised caused me to think just of, I'm always concerned about this. I believe in this policy, I believe in the transparency it provides, but I'm also concerned that anything that would kind of, \nSPEAKER_04:  quiet speech or make people uncomfortable about raising a concern. And one would be, say, an individual in the public approach to member of the ethics commission in a time of say a city election and expressed a concern about a particular candidate. And I think we might need to consider, I can tell you that I think, a member of the member of the public knew that it was going to be made a public record, that their name was going to be associated with a concern that they made about a particular candidate, that they would probably not make the comment, or in some cases they would not make the comment. And I think that is a potential concern that we might want to think about. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Go ahead, Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh oh, you froze. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hopefully we get it back. \nSPEAKER_04:  Hopefully we get it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Do any of the other commissioners have any comments? \nSPEAKER_07:  concerns. \nSPEAKER_07:  Che \u00e9 tous pau \nSPEAKER_07:  is \nSPEAKER_07:  Are you getting commission or feedler back? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I'm seeing it. \nSPEAKER_05:  or the zoom means okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I think the Zoom means okay. So at this time, there's no public comment. So we can move on to the motion vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  at the center. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do we have a motion to approve the recommendation? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I would, I missed your, Commissioner Feedler was going to make a comment and would like to have the benefit of that comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  to move ahead. \nSPEAKER_07:  in that comment. What we can do is go on to the next item. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I hope for the day it gets back. \nSPEAKER_02:  I didn't have the comment to learn. Yeah, okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, okay, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Why don't we wait till we come back with the beat? Okay. So I can take a hit here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we're going to table this item for now. I don't have to do a vote on that, do I, Taylor? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. We're going to go to item number five, recommendation to conduct a study session to discuss the November 12th, 2022 memorandum entitled Notice of Allegations of the City's Ethics Policy. \nSPEAKER_07:  regarding the conduct of certain councilmen. Actually, you know what? I don't think I want to do that one, because I'd rather have Commissioner Fiedler here. Is he back? \nSPEAKER_07:  Whoa, look, I still want enough. That's okay to worry about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm back. That's okay. That's okay. We're in. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's the neck kind of day. Connection. Connection issue. I'm back. \nSPEAKER_07:  next kind of day. Your here. \nSPEAKER_07:  You had a comment that you were going to make before you froze. \nSPEAKER_03:  I did, I'm sorry, that was just wonderful timing, wasn't it? \nSPEAKER_03:  very briefly I think this has come up in a few different contexts that at previous meetings discussions on this issue. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  it. \nSPEAKER_03:  trying to \nSPEAKER_03:  strike a tricky balance here acknowledging that there's no perfect fit. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that the best solution in that situation where somebody comes to you with a concern. \nSPEAKER_03:  and is hesitant to share that concern. \nSPEAKER_03:  to the extent that their name has to be attached to a public disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city has \nSPEAKER_03:  various channels. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  or \nSPEAKER_03:  sharing concerns. \nSPEAKER_03:  whether they're reporting specific violations or allegations of \nSPEAKER_03:  misconduct or just a larger \nSPEAKER_03:  a more opaque general concern with something. \nSPEAKER_03:  for doing so anonymously. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  I would direct that person. \nSPEAKER_03:  to those available reporting channels in that situation if they are so concerned about having their name shared. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  in connection with the comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, again, I don't think that's a reason to abandon or substantially alter this policy. I think that that's the work around and that the rest of the policy is meant to kind of capture more broadly. \nSPEAKER_03:  certain baseline factual information about more contacts than are otherwise disclosed current. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Commissioner Feedler. Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, just two things first. I want to thank Commissioner Feedler for going through each of those and explaining how. \nSPEAKER_01:  how the policy is intended to apply or not apply to them. And it's clear that both Commissioner Feedler and Commissioner Shatwell \nSPEAKER_01:  spent a lot of time in the wording of this and I really, really respect that and I'm grateful for it. The other thing I have to say and this might be, well this is based on experience as I've had to. I do think it is possible for the press to ask questions in a way that feel as though it certainly feel to the receiver as though they are trying to influence the commission. And that would be when they would be speaking to us perhaps about something that is pending that we are going to consider or is going to come back in front of us. And \nSPEAKER_01:  disclosing those since their intent is disclosing those contents doesn't necessarily bother me. But I do think it could be the subject of this perhaps. So I think the point is that there's a line that's difficult to find here. And I think assuming we adopt this now, I hope that in the future that other commissioners that come after us and that perhaps look at this and want to know what it means have the benefit of hearing some of these discussions or some of these examples because I think it might be useful to them as they go through their work. So those are my comments. Thanks. Anyone else? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, and JT there's still no one for public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_07:  Can I have a motion to adopt the... \nSPEAKER_07:  resolution. \nSPEAKER_07:  as amended. \nSPEAKER_07:  As amended. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feedler, can I put you down as the second? \nSPEAKER_03:  You may. I'll second. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so I have a motion by Commissioner Shotwell and a second by Commissioner Fiedler. JT, would you please call the roll? \nSPEAKER_06:  Come and share it already. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. Commissioner Debanne-Dictus. Hi. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Come with your heat lurks. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Come here tonight! \nSPEAKER_06:  I Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Nice job, Paul. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  motion here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you very much to Commissioner Schottwollen, Commissioner Feedler for the excellent work on that. \nSPEAKER_07:  and your thoughtfulness in pulling it together. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, the next item is item five, recommendation to conduct a study session to discuss the October 12, 2022 memorandum titled Notice of Allegace alleged violations of the city's ethics."

Julian, is that you? \nSPEAKER_02:  Cherie, I believe you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're interested in this one. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  But we don't have a report back yet, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  No, so this is for the Commission to request staff to vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  Who is that? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I apologize. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, you know, I apologize. I'm sleep deprived. No, it's okay. Our plane got in and I was up for 24 hours. No, it's so hot. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's seen only. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's a no, I'm so sorry to hear that. So this is for, I think it would be best if you would. Let me back up and now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let me let me \nSPEAKER_03:  that I remember what it is. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  and talking with the staff, the vice chair and I. \nSPEAKER_03:  had talked about. \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of what you were just talking about, Commissioner Shotwell, where we need to go and what we need to look at. And it came up also in the context of what's been happening with the elections this last year. And that there have been a number of \nSPEAKER_03:  questionable situations that have come up and we've been concerned by the fact that we haven't seen that the city has the ability to do any type of investigations. And if it was something that we wanted to take on that there are some legal ramifications and possible city charter amendments. So it would be good to know what happens in other cities before we really started looking at what we wanted to do and how we might want to evolve what we are looking at. And we would like to ask the staff to take that investigative work on and come back to us with a report. But that needs to be authorized by the entire commission. So if we have everything in here that you've kind of been thinking we might need to do as we look at evolving what the duties and roles of this commission are in terms of oversight for different areas of the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  five steps back down on. I've been now working a bit stationary for maximum capacity. I think the money \u00e4nd\u9000ing very significantly in the future is using the dollar of intention. And at the \nSPEAKER_03:  I would need somebody to make this motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  If there's something that you think we left off of the list, please speak up now so that we can add it in. \nSPEAKER_03:  as an amendment to the motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I would just like to add, as part of this item, we did send you the request from the city manager for a memorandum from my office and the ethics report that was the driver for a memo that came out of my office about what are the considerations that this commission would need to look at in order to expand those powers. We are a unique city. \nSPEAKER_02:  We do have a lot of moving parts as a charter city and there are some barriers that would need to be overcome in order for this commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  to expand its authority and there is a memorandum on that that was included. \nSPEAKER_02:  Well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I'll definitely support the motion. And I think that the suggested action is appropriately worded. I just want to make sure that it is part of the review if it is approved. It really is, look, first of all, this particular item or activity is actually called out for, maybe not in the same words in the action plan. But looking comprehensively at the action plan is kind of, is the types of duties that we would very much be interested in. And then other duties that the other commissions have. I don't think that the recommendation needs to be revised, but I just wanted to call that out. If this is approved, then I would expect really to kind of have staff look at the action plan and to be doing the analysis of the benchmarking based on what is in the action plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  So one of the things that I've asked the Vice Chair to do is, is one to keep a list of parking lot issues, things that come up in this meeting, like looking at the internet. \nSPEAKER_03:  so that we can make sure we don't lose sight of them and we bring them back. But I've also asked her to work closely with the staff on our list of priorities and really keep that moving and make sure that we're working on that also. So that's one of the things that the vice chair is going to be taking on in part of her role is keeping that moving. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Anyone else have any comments? Questions? Is there any public comment? JT? \nSPEAKER_00:  At this time if you'd like to speak in the zoom meeting please use the raise hand feature. \nSPEAKER_00:  Seeing none, they're concludes the poll, the comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  If I could get a motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a motion in a second. A vote please. \nSPEAKER_00:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you everyone and we thought it would be better to have the information pulled together by staff before we set up any type of ad hoc because it would be the groundwork. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  The next item, I had a conversation with April regarding some of the funds that we have already set aside. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we kind of combine six and seven? Or can I take seven first?"

About the fact that, and this was before we knew that we were gonna get the sign off on all of this, but that if it happened after October, and at that point we didn't know we were gonna have the $100,000, we would be in a window where we wouldn't be able to buy any of the promotional items that we've talked about purchasing. We've got a very tight window now, because the purchase has to be made before the end of September. And what I'm asking is that you authorize the vice chair and I to work with the staff on what those promotional items will be, and so we can get those purchased, so that as soon as this is approved by the city council, we've got everything ready to really roll out and do the big, \nSPEAKER_02:  Big. \nSPEAKER_02:  Big show that we want to do on why this is important and have some type of trinket that the staff can have to remind them of why ethics is important. \nSPEAKER_02:  Are there any questions, any concerns, comments?

And Julian, this has been such a big project for you. I'm gonna let you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  you can take \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  Give the news. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, I mean, we all have been here this long. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so you did read item 7 correctly. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know whenever I joined you guys and all these efforts, this was our big project. So it is excellent to see this. I don't come here on the agenda. So if you remember, there was an outhawk that was formed and we looked into what we currently had as in our charter and then what other cities had as principles and values and we created the value statement and the principles that we have in the code. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know we workshop that here in the commission and then sent it to the policy making process through all the administrative officers, the directors, pro-udged feedback, a lot of other stakeholders and you know staff in the city also and we brought that back for review. You guys continue to review that and either accept the suggestions or in the comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, work those through and workshop them and then add them to the code of conduct and ethics. Then after that it was sent for the bargaining process. So, you know, although that did take a lot longer than what we anticipated, you know, many months, we that did conclude just recently and Heather, you know, our ethics officer did play a big role in that. So, we're very grateful to have her join us and be part of this. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  The item is correct. The bargaining process concluded and very happy to report that the code did not receive really any changes at all. It was mostly just walking the last bargaining unit through the concerns that they had around training and defining certain terms, which Taylor helped with Heather to make sure that that gets done. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the code is \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, presented to you as part of this item and it is, you know, ready for your review and if you believe that it is appropriate to recommend it and to afford it to the council so that it can amend and restate chapter 2.07 which would replace the existing code of conduct there. You know, very, very glad and happy to be able to say that it is ready and I don't know if Heather wants to add any additional information or you chair or anyone else please go ahead. \nSPEAKER_06:  Are there you there? \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm here, chair. Would you like to say anything? \nSPEAKER_04:  No, Julie and set it all. I'm just really glad that we were able to close the loop on this and start moving forward. But Julie and did a good job in explaining. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  We were all hopeful that it would be done before the end of the calendar year. I think we were beginning to lose hope. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so it was a long time ago that Commissioner de Benedictus and I worked on this. So it's nice to see it ready. So if we adopt the recommendation to send it to City Council, it will just go and then it's up to them. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, and so. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're staff will present a recommendation to request City Council to ask my office to draft an ordinance. Hot tip. It's already drafted. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we typically don't present them with ordinances right out of the gate. So in the event there's any feedback we would need to make necessary changes, possibly mean confer. But this should move rather quickly as long as there's no changes to be submitted back to the City Council if the item is successful. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't think that the code of conduct was attached to the package I received. \nSPEAKER_02:  It was another copy of the disclosure draft. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, oops. The city clerk's office will get that fixed. \nSPEAKER_06:  Were there any? \nSPEAKER_06:  I mean, we had talked about the fact that once it goes through the meeting confer, we would like to see it, but that we really wouldn't make any changes from there because it would need to go back and we don't want to reopen that door. So you'll just give us a copy of that and repost it so that the public has it also. \nSPEAKER_06:  does have to be reposted. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, there were no changes from the bargaining process. It was just more of an explanation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and then it'll be posted to this item on legislature. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  And now let's get around the clock. \nSPEAKER_06:  I was like one of the first things that we did and we didn't think it was ever gonna happen, but it did. Yay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  So do I have a motion that we refer it to City Council? A public comment first. \nSPEAKER_03:  At this time if you'd like to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature to speak. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think so. \nSPEAKER_03:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I have a motion and who's gonna get in there to be the second? \nSPEAKER_06:  There we go. We have a motion in a second. Can we have the vote please? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you."

Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we talked about the meet and con for a process. That was a win the survey that we talked about last month that launched on September 7th. You should have a copy of that survey. \nSPEAKER_03:  In front of you just as an FYI, we presented that to all the department heads, all of our administrative officers and our public information officers team. \nSPEAKER_03:  for distribution. It's also on the internet. It's going out in different newsletters, including \nSPEAKER_03:  the city manager's newsletter on Friday this week. We also provided hard copies for employees that do not have \nSPEAKER_03:  City email addresses or access to city computers. \nSPEAKER_03:  So far we've gotten 40 responses, which is pretty exciting in my opinion. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we're getting some really good creative feedback. \nSPEAKER_03:  So looking forward to sitting down with \nSPEAKER_03:  the ethics team and going through that and compiling. \nSPEAKER_03:  a shorter list to bring to the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I wanted you guys to consider and we may need to talk to Taylor about this during the ad hot conversation, but my recommendation would be to \nSPEAKER_03:  maybe consider putting together. \nSPEAKER_03:  an ad hoc just to meet with Julian and I after the ethics team has whittled down the list to come up with an even smaller slate. \nSPEAKER_03:  to bring to the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  to pick a handful and as a reminder, we'll send out \nSPEAKER_03:  Those top three that you pick, maybe even two, two back out to city staff. \nSPEAKER_03:  to the city workforce for a final vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm \nSPEAKER_03:  So something to consider. \nSPEAKER_03:  We can talk about that during the last item. \nSPEAKER_03:  I also wanted to let you know the ethics point our NABX help line at the city auditor has agreed to partner with this so we're super excited that we are moving forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  with that. \nSPEAKER_03:  They've also agreed they being the city auditor has agreed to share the cost 50-50. \nSPEAKER_03:  I also wanted to lift up Julian. He was able to negotiate a reduction in one-time fees. \nSPEAKER_03:  by about 50%. \nSPEAKER_03:  saving the city about $8,000. \nSPEAKER_03:  So good job Julian on that so total cost. \nSPEAKER_03:  To get us started is about $18,000 and that's down from 31,000. We're hoping to execute this contract before the end of this fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_03:  and once that contract is executed, we anticipate eight to 12 weeks before we launch. \nSPEAKER_03:  the helpline. \nSPEAKER_03:  and in the education program, we're just... \nSPEAKER_03:  busy building it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I wanted to, we had talked about any costs. \nSPEAKER_03:  that the ethics program might incur. \nSPEAKER_03:  Using the learning management system, I just wanted to confirm that there are no costs that we would incur that any department. \nSPEAKER_03:  In curves for use of the LMS so no money will be going towards that which is \nSPEAKER_03:  a lot of money for us to do other things with. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Also wanted to let you know that I or the ethics team I have taken over ownership of the new employee orientation monthly training. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_03:  that. \nSPEAKER_03:  The attorney's office, the attorney's office has done a really good job of doing those trainings, but I'll be taking that over. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  starting actually in October this month, I'll be. \nSPEAKER_03:  traveling so that'll start next month. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then just busy building the communications plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  And with that, that's the end of my report, but I wanted to turn it over to Sydney to give a quick update. \nSPEAKER_04:  Good afternoon, Commission. Just a small update on the supplier code of conduct. We've compiled a number of a lot of research on what other cities are doing across the country here in California, as well as our neighbors to the North and Canada. Many cities there have their own supplier code of conducts. Now we're moving forward to determine what's already covered elsewhere in our procurement processes, so coordinating with financial management in the city attorney's office, take a reduce for redundancies in what our supplier code will contain and solidify what the content will be there. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  You have her in Sydney, because anyone have any questions? \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes. Thank you. Thank you. So thanks for everything you guys are accomplishing. I just have one question about the survey and the development of the motto and the symbols and stuff. How does that relate to or does it relate it all to when the city council acts on the code of conduct? Do we have to, they're not connected at all. We can go forward with this. \nSPEAKER_07:  their independent efforts. One of them is a branding effort for the education and so they'll happen simultaneously. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, and the education doesn't have to wait for the code of conduct either, is that right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, we want to make sure that it's obviously, you know, the code is adopted. But there are certain elements in Heather, I can speak to this of the Education Program that we can continue to move forward, regardless of when the code comes before the council. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so we can do these things right now. Okay, I just wanted to kind of understand that what's related to water, what has to go first, but it sounds like it doesn't matter. So, great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  and Mishnah our Nova. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. I have a question for Julian and Heather. Is it possible to attend one of the new employee trainings? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll talk with HR. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, check in with HR on that commissioner. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Any other questions? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Give me a shot, well. \nSPEAKER_02:  Just along the lines of Commissioner Anorba's comment, your question. You know, I really just want to reiterate, and I know Commissioner David Addictus has made this offer before I have is. To real and possibly Commissioner of Vice-Jourpolic is to really leverage the commissioners if you can in talking with city employees. You got seven commissioners here that we would all be welcome to meet with and be part of an effort to talk with city employees about the ethics commission and ethics and the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  commissariat oh \nSPEAKER_05:  like this. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. Congratulations on the supplier code of conduct. That's a big one. I think it's great that the LMS system is not going to hit the budget to badly. It's not often just in terms of working many LMS systems that it can work that way, where everything is going to be embraced without much cost. Heathers request to seek feedback or a partner on the commission. I'm happy to volunteer Heather on that piece as you delimit or hone in the feedback from the survey. And anybody else who would like to join, happy to do it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Any other commissioners have questions, comments? \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  JT, is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_00:  At this time, if you'd like to speak on ScytheM, please use the raise hand feature. \nSPEAKER_00:  Seeing none, that concludes the public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  and I have a motion to receive and file the update. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a motion in a second and we call the vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you."

And the city attorney then got, Taylor got permission to retain outside council and we are expecting the opinion from outside council momentarily.

So we had a request from Heather that we possibly set up one last work group to work with her on the motto. Commissioner D.
