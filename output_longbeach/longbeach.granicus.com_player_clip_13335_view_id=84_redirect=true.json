The proposed project at 916 Coronado Avenue is in the two family residential standard lots zoning district. \nSPEAKER_01:  and as a contributor to the Rose Park Historic District. \nSPEAKER_01:  No changes are proposed to the primary residents at the front lot. District 2. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Do we have a presentation, please? \nSPEAKER_03:  A case planner Miguel, Samayoa, will be presenting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Good evening, Chair and fellow commissioners. Before you this evening is a request for a certificate of appropriateness for an accessory dwelling unit, garage and storage at the rear of a lot located at 916 Coronado Avenue. \nSPEAKER_04:  which is a contributing property within the Rose Parkistor District District 2. \nSPEAKER_04:  The subject property is located on the east side of Coronado Avenue between East Tent Street and Aits Street. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's within the R2 and zoning district, which is two family residential standard lots, the property totals 6,255 square feet in area. \nSPEAKER_04:  approximately 50 feet wide by 125.1 feet deep. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  The existing home is a contributing building to the Rose Parkes Park District. \nSPEAKER_04:  based on building permits that House was built in 1922 with the major expansion to the side of 1951. \nSPEAKER_04:  The single story residential structure is as it's been approximately in L shape while the detached garage is rectangular and located on the eastern and rear portion of the lot. \nSPEAKER_04:  The single story house was designed in a more modest, communal traditional architectural style. The housing garage features Stucco body and a crane color with white trim. \nSPEAKER_04:  The house itself has a front-facing Gable roof system and a small side-facing Gable from the expansion in 1951 with great composite roof shingles. \nSPEAKER_04:  It also retains some of the original windows. \nSPEAKER_04:  The garage has a flat roof system with the door for two cars and one door accommodating one car. \nSPEAKER_04:  The applicant is proposing to demolish the existing three car garage, construct a 684 foot square foot. 684 square foot detached three car garage with an attached 114 square foot laundry storage room. In conjunction with a 798 square foot accessory dwelling unit above the garage at the rear of the lot. \nSPEAKER_04:  The proposed project requires approval of the CHC because the proposed addition creates a second story that would be visible from the public right of way. \nSPEAKER_04:  To be granted approval, the project must comply with the Secretary of the Interior Standards for rehabilitation and meet the criteria for a certificate of appropriateness. \nSPEAKER_04:  The proposed EDU is permitted by right under the city zoning ordinance and the R2 and zoning of the property as well as by state law subject to compliance with unit size requirements and conformance with design guidelines and other ADU development standards. \nSPEAKER_04:  The existing one story residential building is shown in red. \nSPEAKER_04:  The proposed garage in the EDU above a chair, approximately the same footprint and shown in green. \nSPEAKER_04:  For reference, the existing garage. \nSPEAKER_04:  He's shown an orange. \nSPEAKER_04:  The building will be set back four feet from the Northern side property line. \nSPEAKER_04:  and eat feed from the southern side property line. \nSPEAKER_04:  and this particular project will be rectangular in shape. \nSPEAKER_04:  In the elevations we can see the ADU will have a side facing gable roof system north to south with a small front facing cross cable on the southern side of the balcony. Access will be provided from the southern side via stairs. \nSPEAKER_04:  The ADU is proposed to be 22 feet 10 inches in height as measured to the peak of the roof, whereas the existing house is 16 feet 1 inch. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here we have a rendering of the proposed project. As you can see, the scale of the project is consistent with the development patterns around this stretch of Coronado Avenue. \nSPEAKER_04:  with other two store structures located at the rear of the neighborhood, neighboring adjacent lots. \nSPEAKER_04:  The roast-parkestor district ordinance states that addition shall be consistent with the scaling character of the existing streetscape and at the design of a new structure shall achieve a similar architectural character of the original building. Similarly, \nSPEAKER_04:  The addition of an ADU on the rear a lot behind the primary residence is acceptable provided that it is not highly visible from the Butler-Gryderway. \nSPEAKER_04:  that propose project as a whole will maintain appropriate steel for the property and within the context of the Rose Park historic district and context of the block, which to reiterate contains many, many lots developed with two story buildings at the rear as well as some two story apartments along Coronado Avenue. \nSPEAKER_04:  The proposed project is compatible with the existing residents modest architectural style. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Secretary of the Interior Standards for Abilitation, standard nine states, New Work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing size, scale, and architectural features. \nSPEAKER_04:  in compliance with standard number nine, the proposed design of the EDU. \nSPEAKER_04:  is similar interpretation of that minimal traditional architectural style and borrows from the materials and features from the primary residents on that lot. \nSPEAKER_04:  but is also different cheated by slightly more simplified design as compared to that of the primary residence. \nSPEAKER_04:  Moreover, the garage and the proposed EDU are configured on the site in a manner that permits the primary residents to provide some screening from public view. \nSPEAKER_04:  As designed, the proposed garage storage and two story ADU will have minimal visual impacts when viewed from the street along Coronado Avenue. The proposed project will be consistent with Indian compliance with the city's residential development standards for the on two end zoning district. \nSPEAKER_04:  the Rose Park Historic District Ordnance and the Rose Park Historic District Guidelines. \nSPEAKER_04:  The proposed garage will not be relocated from its location, while the proposed EDU will sit above the garage, both of which are located to reiterate at the rear of the property. \nSPEAKER_04:  As it pertains to the ADU, the CHC's purview is limited to design review for consistency within the historic district standards. \nSPEAKER_04:  with the required positive findings. \nSPEAKER_04:  Starfork recommends approval of a certain degree of appropriateness, such as to the conditions of approval to demolish existing three car garage. Constructed 684 foot square foot detached three car garage. Constructed 114 square foot attached laundry sordrome and constructed new 798 square foot accessory dwelling unit above the garage. \nSPEAKER_04:  This concludes staff's presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  The applicant Lorenzo Verrilla is available for any questions online as well as a property owner, Trina. She is in attendance. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you so much. Does the commission have any questions for staff regarding this project? \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Grassoffey, I have a couple of questions. I have a question here. There are some code-related items that impact the exterior aesthetic like windows and setbacks and are subject to change during the review by the building department. Does planning have a method for revisiting these items after they have been changed by building? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for the question commissioner. So we go through what's called a substantial compliance process. So for example, you may have a window on plans that doesn't meet a minimum dimension for egress and during the plan to process those comments would come back from building. A supervisor would look over the chain. So Andrea in this case and determine whether it was within. \nSPEAKER_06:  substantial conformance of the approval you gave. So if the window remained in the same location, and it needed to be six inches wider, you know, that that is a minor enough change that it would not \nSPEAKER_06:  We've not returned. Occasionally, we can't make that finding. So for example, \nSPEAKER_06:  I set back as wrong not from a zoning standpoint but from a building separation or fire standpoint and the whole location of the building changes. So that would not be approved on a staff level. We would come back to this body for what's called a modification. \nSPEAKER_06:  to the benefit of the applicant and just process, we try to reconcile changes and find a way to do substantial conformance, but there is that 1% exception where the change is so drastic that it would come back to this body. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do any other questions? Have questions for staff at this time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, is the applicant here today? \nSPEAKER_03:  Hi. Could you state your name and address please and let us know if you have any further comment about that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, okay, my name is Trina Taylor. My address is currently 916 Coronado Avenue, and I'll be 90804. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I currently don't have any questions or anything, and thank you for having me here today. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  commissioners anything? \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. Is there anyone else in the public that has a question? \nSPEAKER_03:  or comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Appreciate your time. \nSPEAKER_00:  If you're joining us virtually, and you would like to make public comment on this item, please press star nine or use the raise hand function in the bottom center portion of your screen. \nSPEAKER_00:  There appears to be no further public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you.

And according to the staff recommendation. \nSPEAKER_03:  So moved, Commissioner Hunter. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, the second. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mission in Miss Alpses II\u7528 \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you.

The residents, and the garage are in craftsmen, architectural style, and are contributors in the Rose Park Historic District. \nSPEAKER_03:  The exterior of the residence is defined by wood shingle cladding areas with brick veneer, portion with vertical wood siding. \nSPEAKER_03:  horizontal wood siding smooth suck of finish on the porch double double hang and fix windows wood windows and gate will roof with rafter tails \nSPEAKER_03:  The existing structures are decently preserved and no additional exterior alterations are proposed.

The edition will be set back 7 feet from the south interior site property line, 17 feet, 6 inches from the north side property line, and approximately 58 feet from the rear property line, meeting all minimum required setbacks. \nSPEAKER_03:  The proposed development will also meet the requirements for lock-cup rich, floyer, ratio, and minimum open space for an R2 end zone property. \nSPEAKER_03:  The existing floor plan on this slide provides the extent of the proposed demo to allow the construction of the addition. \nSPEAKER_03:  This slide demonstrates the proposed floor plan, including the existing and new addition, which as mentioned is... \nSPEAKER_03:  consisting of a new master bedroom with the bathroom and laundry area. \nSPEAKER_03:  The elevation shown on this slide is a rear elevation where the proposed position will be constructed. The new roof will provide similar composition shingles with a 5x12 roof pitch to match the existing gable roof design. \nSPEAKER_03:  The addition will be constructed at a height of 15 feet 10 inches as measured to the roof ridge line. This height will be just over six inches lower than the existing height of the residence highest roof ridge line. The new addition east elevation will also provide one wood double hung window. I relocated existing rectangular on wood window and a nine light exterior wood door. With regards to the additions cladding, staff recently received a revised set of plans after the staff report in the agenda was published. As shown on the slide, the initial design includes a smooth stuck will finish at the base of the addition including the wall \nSPEAKER_03:  We're the proposing exterior doors located. \nSPEAKER_03:  The applicants revise plans on the right. \nSPEAKER_03:  Now shows horizontal hearty panel siding, continuing to the base of the structure. \nSPEAKER_03:  The additions revised South elevation along the interior side will include a fixed wood window providing natural light into the additions vestibule. \nSPEAKER_03:  horizontal parties panel society and smooth stuff of finish around the the proposed concrete porch. \nSPEAKER_03:  the west elevation, which is the front, will maintain its existing conditions as the applicants not proposing any alterations. \nSPEAKER_03:  And lastly, the addition's north interior side elevation will include one double hung window horizontal hearty panel sighting as recently revised. \nSPEAKER_03:  This slide before you illustrates the existing and the additions roof roof plan. The addition will provide a continuous design and shape. \nSPEAKER_03:  And this slide includes the materials proposed for the new addition. Although the applicant is proposing alternative materials, staff has included conditions of approval. \nSPEAKER_03:  in order to reach further compatibility with the existing residence design, these conditions will be presented in the following slides. \nSPEAKER_03:  As proposed in condition, the proposed project will not detract from the historic neighborhood or the historic character of the existing building on site, specifically along the prominent areas of the building visible from the public right of way. \nSPEAKER_03:  The proposed will be consistent in any compliance with the city's residential development standards for the R2N zoning district, the Rose Park historic district design guidelines, Secretary of Interior Standards and Rose Park historic district ordinance, the Craftsman style guide and certificate of appropriateness findings. \nSPEAKER_03:  and as I mentioned earlier. \nSPEAKER_03:  staff did include some conditions of approval that will assist with ensuring that the addition is more compatible with the existing building. \nSPEAKER_03:  condition. I would also like to note that the conditions of approval that were uploaded and printed with the agenda, unfortunately, was a draft. The new set of conditions of approval. \nSPEAKER_03:  and findings were provided to the commissioners and e-mailed and to the public as well as the applicant. \nSPEAKER_03:  So condition number seven. \nSPEAKER_03:  The new roof eve overhangs along the north and south. She'll incorporate rafter-tells, expose her rafter-tells, and no facet board shall be incorporated. \nSPEAKER_03:  and condition number 14. \nSPEAKER_03:  states that the re-addition shell incorporate wood chingled cladding and smooth stuff go at the base which is more compatible with the existing materials throughout the building. \nSPEAKER_03:  And with the aforementioned findings which are all in the affirmative, staff does recommend approval. \nSPEAKER_03:  These are the certificate of appropriations request subject to the conditions of approval. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that is to construct a 371 square foot single story re-radition with a 33 square foot report to the single family residence. \nSPEAKER_03:  and this concludes the staff's presentation. Both staff and the applicant, Karen, are available for any questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Do the commissioners have any questions of staff? \nSPEAKER_07:  I just wanted to clarify that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Excuse me that the Hardy Board is off the table is that correct? That's what the condition number 14 meant \nSPEAKER_03:  So condition number 14. \nSPEAKER_03:  The applicant is proposing horizontal, hardy panel, but the staff did. \nSPEAKER_03:  did include the condition to ensure further compatibility to for the applicant to install similar wood sighting. \nSPEAKER_03:  single-sighting on the addition. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we would allow these to go finish at the base. So that's the newest condition, which is number 14. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  This is Commissioner Chris Safi. So it is kind of difficult to get our arms around this late around these many changes. So I'm just, is there a way that we can avoid this in the future? Is there something that we're seeing that happened that was just a unique? \nSPEAKER_06:  went off or what would happen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Saffi, I can chime in here. This is Alejandro at the city. Yeah, this is more of a one off. Typically, we would have these prepared in advance, typically within a week or so. It doesn't happen all that often, but I think, as a courtesy to the applicant, we wanted to just make sure that they were able to present what their true proposal was based on this drawing here. So I think that's the reason we have it. We do apologize that it is late, but yes, this is a one off, and we would typically have this too in advance, and we typically prepare the applicants and notify them that any substantial changes we need to know in advance. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, thank you. Just we just want to make sure that we give full hearing and viewing of this. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Any further commissions have questions for staff? \nSPEAKER_07:  No. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is the applicant here, please? \nSPEAKER_02:  and chair and commissioners and staff. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to present your name and address for the record please. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm Karen Hewis. I live at 922 Milino Avenue in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  commissioners. A commissioner, Chris Alfie. So I just want to make sure I understand so. \nSPEAKER_06:  the new addition at the rear. \nSPEAKER_06:  is going to be... \nSPEAKER_06:  Hall, horizontal, sliding. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, through discussions with the planning staff, determined that \nSPEAKER_02:  bits exciting,ics procent s i \nSPEAKER_02:  on the entire law would be preferred to \nSPEAKER_02:  doing a combination of materials because the existing house already has like a multitude of different years of work so to simplify everything and just keep it consistent We agree to that that would be fine to do that way \nSPEAKER_07:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, and I think it was a good idea to remove that horizontal band. \nSPEAKER_06:  and take that ugly down because that window was breaking that band and I thought that was going to be one of my comments so I think it was an improvement. \nSPEAKER_06:  So thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_07:  commissioners, anybody else? Have a question for the applicant. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Does anyone in the public wish to speak? \nSPEAKER_00:  If you're joining us virtually and you would like to make a public comment on this item, please use the raise hand function at this time or press star 9 if you're joining us telephonically. \nSPEAKER_00:  There appears to be no further public comment on this item. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you.
