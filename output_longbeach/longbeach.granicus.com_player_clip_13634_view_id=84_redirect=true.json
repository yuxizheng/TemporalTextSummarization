        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  W \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a question. Thank you for having me here. It's a glad to be back in Long Beach. I used to live here back around 2005, here about three years in the downtown area. I got here a little early. Got a chance to drive around in Long Beach. So it's amazing to be somewhere. You know, that time travel sends a you get from places like, wow. So I think I'll be here. My name is Mark Desiple, and I work for the California Civil Rights Department. We changed the art name. We were formerly the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. And we changed our name last summer. And I'll tell you a little bit about that. We can look over to the next slide. So you may know the Department of Fair Employment and Housing as a Civil Rights Agency that you can call for enforcement, investigation, and we can still do all of that. But one of the things that has changed since last summer is the name to properly reflect its job. You know, what we do. So it's not just, you know, housing, but it's all like civil rights. So to kind of ensure that the name really symbolizes what we do. The name was changed last summer. It was also something else that changed last summer. We can look over to the next slide. One of the things that happened was that we created a community conflict resolution movement. \nSPEAKER_03:  But the language for that unit has actually been in the California law since 1980, under the Department of Fairport and Housing. But what was the challenge was that we had to be funded. So the unit, what could be developed, it couldn't be created. So it wasn't until last year that it was out. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so the unit was developed in a creative last summer. And we were actually hired in a code. So a little bit about me is before joining the Community Comfort Resolution unit, I was working for the most department of justice community relation service. So it's kind of like a federal version of this unit. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  to community conflicts on the basis of the race, color, national, origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or disability, doing mediation, conciliation, education, training, consultations. I'm going to show you something very similar. So argument was developed and modeled after the community relations service. Our mission, \nSPEAKER_03:  enforcement investigation. \nSPEAKER_03:  are you in the community conflict resolution that is to promote peaceful relations? And I'll show you what the tools are. Can you go to the next slide? \nSPEAKER_03:  So here again, since 1980, we've been in power to do the work, but it wasn't until last summer that we were funded. And if we can go to the next slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  terms of the jurisdiction, one of the wonderful things about California is that. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  or in gender-gender identity sexual orientation disability, but there's a wide spectrum of jurisdictions that we can engage in that department uses in its work. And one of the things about our work is that when services are requested, they have to be in relation to a community dispute, disagreement, or difficulty, arising out of discriminatory practices. \nSPEAKER_03:  And it has to be requested, so... \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's say you're interested in our services, you just request them, perfectly. Something is happening. I have to make sure I first do the outreach so you're informed that we exist. And then I need the request for you to say, oh yeah, stay. I definitely need you to help out. \nSPEAKER_03:  was an interest in our services and the requesting come from a body of the East Department of City and advocacy through the faith through the week permanent individual but it has to be a community conflict that can't be an individual conflict. Who can go to the next one? \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in terms of what we do, we design conflict resolution processes. So imagine that a hate crime has occurred here. And you're interested in doing something in response. But you haven't had that. \nSPEAKER_03:  you want to know what they think, what kind of recommendations they would provide. What are those issues that you're not hearing about? Well, let's go to the community and find out, but how do we do that? We can call us and we can help you to discuss, you know, maybe different things we can do. Do you want to do some small breakout sessions where we can facilitate small groups and have different conversations? \nSPEAKER_03:  We can help you with that too. Let's talk about objectives. Let's talk about what those questions would be. There's different tools. Now you can even do electronic polling so that you can ask questions and find out in the room. Love this is the priority. Let's talk about A. The response that most people selected. What does that look like? Or you can just do old fashioned dialogues in a room. We can help a community group design those mechanisms to bring people together to discuss issues that they might be facing. That's design, design the process. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next we have facilitated processes. So we can also facilitate those meetings. They can be very simple meetings. They can be a more complex process. \nSPEAKER_03:  of course education. \nSPEAKER_03:  training. \nSPEAKER_03:  One of our interests is to help build capacity. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  to better respond to crisis situations. In my career with CRS, I can tell you that I assisted human relationship commissions up and down the state. I came to Long Beach and quite a few times. I remember like 10 years ago I was here, but I'm not this room in space, but somewhere else. And I have one of the issues. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  That was it. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the community wanted to do a group that would help to raise awareness and provide presence and deterrence through not on-forcement but the community. And so we can theme a few meetings and community groups where their law enforcement was there, talk about like, what does that look like? What does that take? What are the all the issues that you need to think about? What can you do? What can you not do to use the bill? It's a bit small stuff all of that. So again, this is like 10 years ago. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So education and training, one of the things that we're working on as a good example is the escalation training. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you're stuck on a bus or a train and you're the victim and hate, what can you do to address that situation and help de-escalate conflict until you get to safety? So that's one of the, that is the guy that we're working on currently. \nSPEAKER_03:  And any other kind of response, so let's say there's a pretty good response. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  town, law enforcement and community. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be against the protest and demonstrate how do you sort of bring peace back to a community to address all the various concerns. So we can do a plan. You don't have to wait until prices happen. You can have plans that in place we can do scenarios to kind of discuss, I hope you will what you do is happen. What do you inform? Do you have a plan? I do. I do. I do. I do. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  have a way of what you currently do in response to the hate. So what happens at school? Do you just say, well, that's a school district? That's not an art jurisdiction. Do you just leave it alone? Or do you actually engage your position to provide, you know, influence in that? What do you do? You can actually be doing things with you, right? You could be posting dialogues not just with the adults, but you could be engaging youth to try and find out, you know, what are their concerns? You may think you have an idea of a sense of what the concerns are among the adults, but what about you? What do they think? So how can you engage youth to find out, you know, what it is if they're here alone? Technical consultations, they can be as quick as a phone call. 15 minutes, just to say, this is what happened? I'm interested in your feedback. I can be spotted in red flags. Any concerns? Not interested in, you know, you coming down and meeting with various parties to see if we can like mediate this. That just, you know, we're on it. We don't want to make it worse. We just want to make sure that we're on the right track. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  it could be a quick call or it could be more of a month or years long process where we work with you to engage whatever challenge or obstacle. The community disputes, so there are cases where a more of a sit down mediation is requested, or that's an interest. So, do you, for example, there was a time where a tribal organization wanted to build a spiritual structure and it wasn't on a reservation. So, the code enforcement for that county kept finding them. You're doing it wrong. You're not doing it according to code. Well, you know, their response was like, you know, this is for spiritual, spiritual, spiritual, spiritual, spiritual, spiritual. This is according to the code where people are going to be. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have the right, we believe we have the right based on, this is 3M of religion now, this is 4M. \nSPEAKER_03:  and well. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what the crowd was saying was like, \nSPEAKER_03:  Imagine if you were building a church and you were doing it wrong, and then in the middle of service, it just crumbles. Then who has lives open and all of that, right? So we have to have the mediation. And it was taking forever, and we just asked this very simple question to the code enforcement, and people who know all the plans, all these complex codes. If you were them, what paperwork would you file? What would you do if you were them? And they said, oh, I filed number 32, and 52, and 32, and this and this. Okay, did you catch that? \nSPEAKER_03:  Can you just do that? Yeah, I got it. I wrote it down. I pulled it and we settled it. And we were able to remove all the finds from this case. So sometimes a mediation has to be like a classical mediation. So it's not referred by a court, but we can be the parties to try and resolve it. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  of groups and rounds that sort of \nSPEAKER_03:  We are neutral and impartial so we built eight sides. \nSPEAKER_03:  We are confidential, so our conversation with parties will not be shared with other government agencies. And that also means our own civil rights department. They have a fireball between our unit and the investigation and the enforcement people. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So why don't community trust us if we were sharing information about our conversation? We can't put still and so we have to be confidential. And then last thing again as I mentioned before, again we're not law enforcement, so we know that any of those functions are just investigation, lawsuits, etc. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so in terms of how I'm working with anybody who is a community group in organization, you'll see that human relation commissions are in there, but you're not trying to organize schools, government agencies, nonprofits, but also community leaders who are grassroots people who just speak for the community. That's enough. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so here are a few other examples. I kind of mentioned the first one. Of course, the gas-related intentions between law enforcement and communities, facilitating dialogue between nonprofit organizations and local government to ensure means for access to marginalized communities. Oh, I'm seeing this is an old version. I've updated this slide. But I want to provide better more accurate examples. So sometimes, acres come to town as well. So I'm giving you other examples, other than what's on here. I think it's been some time since the National Socialist Movement was doing rounds around here. And then KKK was in Anaheim last, as I recall, but sometimes when they show up, they want communities to know that they're showing up because they want the attention. They want counter protesters and help them also, you know, rally their own troops and they get support to recruit people. So one of the things that will offer is working with law enforcement to ensure that there are contingency plans in place so that there are no physical confrontations of violence between groups on the ground. Because it's really easy. There are a lot of ways. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  where a demonstration can go wrong and it turns against chaotic and crazy. So one foot. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, low raise awareness with law enforcement about certain things that are sort of considered and think about, and that goes with working with community groups as well. So I just got a little more possibility that you know, violence happens. And it's not a people way they're right to account for what they're sorry if you want to emphasize that. Again, educating human relation commissions, the help of response to various situations. And working with schools, you all now have seen probably many different situations on the news where social media really facilitates people getting into trouble because they post some, you know, really crazy stuff that. I'm like, what would you think? Of course they have that's wrong. And nowadays with social media, it really travels very, very quickly. So, you know, whether it's school or in the police department. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, there's various opportunities for work and you know, you got a lot of things. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if you have other initiatives, there are three great efforts in California in happening. You are civil rights department. So our community council resolution was one of them. And here is another one. And it's California versus paint. You are in a county that where you are lucky to have a lot of community infrastructure. Because it is. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's gonna turn water on. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's a program through LA County Human Relations Commission. It's LA versus Hague, so you may have heard of that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Call 211, don't connect you to services. This is the California version of that. \nSPEAKER_03:  because not every county has that. And one of the other counties that now has their own version of this orange county, they now also, you can call it 211, and they'll connect you to services. So this is one of the neat things about California is that you call 833-8-0-8, and you have access to through over 200 languages to services, and that you can connect you to some kind of assistance that you can discuss with them. Next. \nSPEAKER_03:  The third is the commission on the state of the payment. So we have a commission and they're tasked with research \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  and to provide many resources as possible. \nSPEAKER_03:  throughout the state. So there are meetings that you could, if you go on the website, you could sign up. There are forums that they are committed to do weekly forums where you can have the opportunity to ask questions and interact with the commissioners. One of our \nSPEAKER_03:  I wouldn't say responsibility. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So that's our little QR code for our web page. So feel free to save our page. You can always Google us, community conflict resolution unit at the California Civil Rights Department. Or you just go to the California Civil Rights Department and you'll land a real see information to get to our page or learn more about California \nSPEAKER_03:  And that's it. Any questions? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, my car. \nSPEAKER_02:  Just a quick process question. Do we need to go to public comment before we start questions? Taylor? \nSPEAKER_02:  But we need to make a lot of shine around her. \nSPEAKER_04:  Usually it is a motion in a second and then you are going to stop it. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So, if I share out all motion that we receive and file this great presentation. I'll show it for a second. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, so after a minute, I'm going to start to talk about our point of view. \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you please state your name for us too when you give us comments? That would be great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a question as far as one. So you guys are doing it. You guys might have a little program or a system. \nSPEAKER_02:  And some people, yeah, I would say he's not able to engage in question answer. But if you ask your question, perhaps we can note it down and maybe one of the commissioners can ask. But unfortunately, he can engage back and forth with the public. Please bring him on. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, bring them off. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I think here tonight thinking I was going to hear more about what actually happened as it did in the work sense. \nSPEAKER_06:  2020 and yet there still is a program in place to not feed on the ground. \nSPEAKER_06:  been restored of Los Angeles. If you do this, it's new leaders to hear that George County has completed crisis intervention services and coming to be where he can't raise the five flags. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, oh see. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm just wondering what's going on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and in our next item, we're actually going to be hearing about the Community Crisis Response Program for the City. For the City. Oh, sure. Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  So yeah, so there are gonna get that tonight. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is a different presentation about the Civil Rights Department sharing with us just what resources are available. So they're related but different. Very different. Yeah, in my budget. I didn't want to interrupt you, but I want you to know that's coming. That's not a big time. I thought they were going to come out. Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, very understandable. So the next item. OK. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Any other public comment? \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, seeing none? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. So we'll go ahead and move to Commissioner Fushon. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Vice Chair, I just want to say thank you for the presentation. I wonder about what the timeframe is if we were asking for a situation and do you have paid staff that does this or volunteers or both? I'm just wondering. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Good question. And you know, that's going to be bad because we do need a slide to kind of share with you a little bit more about our \nSPEAKER_03:  of our new paths. \nSPEAKER_03:  So it's a three person, you can swap. For the whole thing. You can't stand a professional. No problem. \nSPEAKER_04:  for the whole world. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  that had to go back to the legislature and say, look at all the great work we've done. You know, we need more resources. So, like you know, having worked at CRS, where we had three people in two in the LA office, one in San Francisco, that's considered the Western region, covering California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, and look up, that's about 44 million people. So, we were each covering 17 million people. The benefit of the... \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks. Think about that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is it you get really good experience because you're going from one fire to the next to the next to the next? Yeah. So some communities are experiencing an issue for the very first time. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  We've seen it many times. You know, we help our other regions out, so we may travel to other parts of the country to assist. So that's the benefit in terms of timing, as you mentioned. And it depends on what that ask is about. So it might be something very quick. It might be just some feedback. Again, it's a 50 minute call. You know, what? It might be something where, like, no, we're engaged in developing a process. That could take a little bit more time. But it doesn't mean that it's a full-time job. Yeah, the page just means that, you know, I work with you periodically sending you information. What question would you ask in this kind of dialogue? OK, I'll send it to you. So, you know, it depends. It's not going to be full-time. It's just going to be on a case-by-case basis. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  \u05d0\u05ea \u043d\u0438\u0437o \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  This work is so marvelous. I'm really a dumb snack batter. And 1,000 places need you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I didn't really tell you that it was established in 1980 and you got funded recently. Does that mean that for 43 years this organization was volunteering? \nSPEAKER_03:  What that wasn't volunteer didn't exist. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, yeah, when they got flooded, they now have paid staff. I'm one of them. They're spurious. So before, there was no you. \nSPEAKER_03:  No volunteers, no unit at all. \nSPEAKER_05:  Then what happened in Activity? \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know. As many thought it was a good idea that they didn't fund them. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? What's your Alan? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, two quick questions. You had mentioned on the standards of practice, and just to say, I'm surprised by all this, too. I used to work for this state and didn't know this existed. So this is pretty cool. But on the confidentiality piece, for those subject to PRAs or they shielded where they can't be accessed in that respect. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  So the way we work is we try not to capture information. That is, like, you know, Coach Mo's side does. A good example is we were doing a listening session and we mentioned the way we're going to do it is, as we take notes, we're not going to say, \nSPEAKER_03:  and we can say, you know, we met with various organizations, these were the concerns catch. So we think about the way we can take information as well as when we meet with organizations, well, we'll work with them to try and address some of their sensitivity needs, where I've worked with over the years with people in the community who like, I don't even want you on my, I don't want you to keep my number, I'm on your government cell phone. I'll write it down on a piece of paper, you can even put it on your own personal cell and don't put it on your government. So I don't want my information floating around. Okay, I respect that. So it's about trying to be careful about that because we're very conscious about that. So there are, we do have our attorneys that can't help us, you know, help shield us from that to address that very issue of, this part of, you know, the conversation, you can't even ask us about that. That is not subject to the PRI, to public records, so I'm asking. When he's the FOIA, they have that, still taking you off. Think about the California version, but yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  \uafc8\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\uc5b8\ub420 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_07:  \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544 \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  haha \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then my second question was actually just on the tail end of the reporting part. Of the, all the different ways folks could report or call in at the state level. Does that integrate in cities and counties where they also have their own reporting? So there's a holistic kind of accurate data of the challenges the community is facing. Or are those- \nSPEAKER_00:  Come on, thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Talking about the California versus Haiti, that ain't very great. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so the the calling numbers the 211 like how do all of those integrate when there are like among these there are local options and LA County has its own option and how do all those kind of merge together? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, so 211 is a network, but each county hasn't said home. So the most developed is LA County because they've been doing this for a while, so they've trained their staff. But the data for each county is connected through the 211 system. So we contracted with 211 LA so that those operators who have that special fee in responding to hate get the calls. So you may call in a very different county, but the call is rerouted to which you share that. The person with the background and the special fee picks up the phone and provides you with the right amount of services. That's why there were two numbers. \nSPEAKER_03:  one one to the other to the right one one. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I think we're trying to make one more question. \nSPEAKER_02:  for\u8db3more a,\" come into commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's not IT, but one. \nSPEAKER_02:  So you study work with human relations commissions. They know commissions adhere to the Brown Act. And so I'm curious when you work with those commissions, are you actually working to host community mediations or that you're just providing the technical assistance to the commission? Can you share a little bit more about what kind of work you've done with human relations commissions? \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure, from small to large, and the white variety from like starting the commission to, you know, helping the response to situations in very different parts of California. So let's say, critical incident, that one is probably one that's the theme. How do you help a commission respond? And one of the, one of the, of buildings that they have is, \nSPEAKER_03:  law enforcement president or not depending on the needs. So I've done it both ways where law enforcement is present, done it without them, so that they can collect that input and give it to law enforcement. That means planning meetings through an ad hoc system, where a B ad hoc will meet with me, and we'll discuss what you want it to look like, what's your goal, what your objectives. OK. Based on that, you want to have little dialogues around the city. OK. You want to do a big room, like a lot of people, do you want to anticipate a lot of people? Or so that we can do breakouts? Or is it not going to be that big people but enough to have a single one facilitator for the group and that's going to be agenda, the question of the programs. And sometimes it's also sharing information. So done, done on all of that. So it's a lot of technical guidance for them to respond to something from what he's well. What can you do in terms of like hate from messaging, for example, to actually creating a body, human relations commission, or how do you engage, you, what are the possibilities? What could you do there was a commission that was on a yearly basis engaging you into different events. So how to help them with that. And some of it was engaging them into a PSA. Into a deeper PSA, it's like, so that was the need exercise. So it's working with city managers sometimes. Sometimes it's working with other members of city entity. It kind of helped them. Other cities don't have commission, but they may have a committee. Or it's just clean out city managers office. There is no committee, there is no commission. It's working with them. And sometimes it's a more of a nonprofit or a coalition where maybe one example was 10 years after it went from just being a coalition of people who were interested in human relations to the creative 501C 38-OF funding and paid staff. So over 10 years I changed. But sometimes it's like, OK, how do we think about our problems by thinking about prevention? So it's like engaging the Chamber of Commerce. How do we get apprenticeships? How do we provide more employment for a few? OK, we can have different subcommittees. It's organizing people who come together. So I have that coming out of like even police community relations concerns where it started off that way. But it's like, you know what, since we're all kind of gathered here, let's address all these various issues and wind it up with like various subcommittees addressing various different things. Things like seeing a wide variety of things where I can help them think about what does it take to. So it just starts off with a phone call. And then I can help you with the rest. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, thank you. That's great, a lot of great information. Okay, so that concludes our presentation. Was there any... \nSPEAKER_02:  further discussion that the commission wants to have on this item. If not, we can go for the vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Thank you, my test for your time. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I just for your time, I really appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Allen? \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Come to cheer back. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Congratulations, Acabaccio! \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Coveington, Commissioner Bellgau, Bill Gagil, Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Rider \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Montgomery.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, and Erica and Christina. \nSPEAKER_01:  and Anthony, thank you all for being here. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_02:  Ha ha ha! \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  You're on manager and he calls the president. \nSPEAKER_02:  So, all of my colleagues introduced themselves in just one second. The co-existent factor of the organization so that you know, overseas are veterans commission, our racial and Catholic New York. We also oversee our federal and administrative planning and the act to division. One is the Community Incaptivation Administration, which houses the Office of Education Development, all of the city's vital prevention efforts. And then our second division is the act. \nSPEAKER_02:  there's our connection maybe off of the Sunshe<|he|> \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you all for having us stand over. \nSPEAKER_13:  So, to see you all a few months ago, so we're really glad to see you here with you today. My name is Christina Zobre. I am the Mapper Boys and Mapper Social Research within the whole department and the resource connections to the health officer, I'm Erica and I'm so excited. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, my name is Anthony Carcolbo, I am the Program Manager for the Community Crisis Funds Program. I am happy to be here to present to you all the best. \nSPEAKER_02:  Alright, so with that we'll go ahead and get started. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we're going to start with just after this day with a couple of times, which it wouldn't be a little hard to just walk the team. And what do we do? \nSPEAKER_02:  And so... \nSPEAKER_02:  There's been some confusion. So when we first started this program, it's called that Shredded Cranked. The upfinity was a cracked response to it. Here we go. \nSPEAKER_02:  Since they have community crisis response gains, the community crisis response gains are formed by alternative crisis response. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so this is a specialized. \nSPEAKER_02:  Narron, Horcuit. \nSPEAKER_02:  that responds to eligible nonviolent calls for service. We focus on the overall health and quality of life issues. And as I mentioned, it is a brilliant team and it's going to be focused on the nation's future. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  The team moves require ganska significant plus the change in blood\u3063 \nSPEAKER_02:  a medical professional and a peer-nail, a peer-nail, a peer-nail, and a peer-nail. We later talk about the entire structure of the team. \nSPEAKER_02:  And to create this team, we really looked at best practices we just went out. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is one of your favorite places. We looked at this, got this in the cross the country to formulate what our team would look like and what kind of call we would use that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks for having me. \nSPEAKER_02:  So before we go into the particular sort of a train structure, we wanted to just kind of found ourselves in the work and why we were here and why were we doing all these things about what we were setting out to do. And so this was really, \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And the result of the framework for reconciliation is making you hear no after the murder of George Floyd. The city was really thinking about how systemic racism impact their community. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so one of the recommendations that came out of the framework of reconciliation was the creation of an alternative practice response team. And so this team has been in the works now for two years of really building, growing, getting some funding allocated, and figuring out what it is that we're going to look like. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's right. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. And so what we've learned is that \nSPEAKER_02:  Based on our research and best practices across the country, we know that CCR can have the following impact. So when we are responding to low priority calls for service, \nSPEAKER_02:  How specialized teams are on the ground, will people with limited experience and best routines that can address mental health concerns and our community? \nSPEAKER_02:  So we have trained staff that will be able to improve outcomes for our college. So we will be directly dispatched to finding one, one, one, one dispatched to the train. It will have a call to move this function. We're going to talk a little bit more about that later. So they call us, at least that our non-part our civilian team. \nSPEAKER_02:  We also know that alternative pressure response gains for our community rescue response team will need to implement in connection to services and interventions for our community numbers. And we know that the CCR team will diversify and increase to execute resources. So what we say now, what we mean is that now as we are responding to the old primary health service, PDV is then being dispatched to more serious, serious and bad calls for service. \nSPEAKER_02:  also hope to be there. \nSPEAKER_02:  So as many of us here know, sometimes having a police response, you need to be very active with your committee members. And so the hope is to have a peer that can connect to someone, one-on-one, and that would help hopefully help them to access services and will more comfortable accessing those services and reduce the stigma around mental health and behavioral health. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we'd also like to see one of the most early series out that we're excited about is being able to see. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So these are the outputs that we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  I'm gonna hear the other teachers. Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  So everything's going to be a little bit about nationally, with ocean and prices just lost things. But if I can also a little bit about how we got to where we are today. \nSPEAKER_13:  So as you might have seen, I'm trying to give you a seat door and you just stay within the racial association. So what? \nSPEAKER_13:  From that, a advisor group of those first-year department heads, because in the six-system, they have to stop with their department heads first. They come all the same day and they can't come to us. And I think it's a very exciting time to talk about a little bit of what that's looked like. And what that continues to look like, we can go with our advisor group. \nSPEAKER_13:  From that point, you have joined into participating in a national cohort of other cities who are in different phases of the limitation. \nSPEAKER_13:  This is down through the Harvard Government's Reclang talk and I think it's so intramural and the work that we're doing and really wouldn't be where we are today without their support. \nSPEAKER_13:  was really great about this work group, and that, like I mentioned, we are in different stages of implementation. So some groups, some cities have been doing this for years. \nSPEAKER_13:  that have tons of lessons learned than massive teens. \nSPEAKER_13:  They also the building lots of how to get those teams from one pilot. \nSPEAKER_13:  to the citywide 24 hours, 7-day away cooperation, and running from never long away. \nSPEAKER_13:  There's also those who are just a little bit have us. \nSPEAKER_13:  who have lost the last two years, so they have experienced watching for the mix of a panda. \nSPEAKER_13:  And that's also been really interesting to learn their lessons learned because the word did shift. And so we have to be cognizant about how, you know, invocations to the work and how we can, you know, support our community. And then we have you both joining the cohort. \nSPEAKER_13:  about your rock hangers. So they are now learning from us. So not to be afraid of anything wrong with what's in. They're helping leave some work and also help bring those along with us. \nSPEAKER_13:  So that's what I'm really excited about. We're still continuing your work. They are currently working to help us develop a data strategy. But also something that we are really in touch about is keeping the security. So we can show how we are going to have to be in a positive way. How we can learn to be better. And we better work in only way to do that. It's to have a really clear idea around that. \nSPEAKER_13:  So that's what we're helping with our skin. We're very excited about it. \nSPEAKER_13:  over the last here. So about this time, last year through \nSPEAKER_13:  I would say this summer, we hosted listening sessions, but virtually again a percent of, and that's actually when I joined this one. \nSPEAKER_13:  So they work so well here, this program is available to that one for a minute. I think based on some of my work, as an offer for social workers, we have a whole series of seven ones. \nSPEAKER_13:  gave me the program and very excited to be suffering for the last year. So the ambulance has been first and after taking the people in the same session. \nSPEAKER_13:  In last summer, when we were chasing more than everything we were doing, we were still doing all of those. It was really exciting about that. It's not only did we learn that we are all the rights of our community. It was really mindful and we're seeing some of these things in place. Whatever the biggest changes came with the name. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  And that would have been the whole morning in the morning. \nSPEAKER_13:  You don't like it, I'll turn it over again and you're like, that's okay. The one who gets so keen to crisis your thoughts will be gone. That has been Well received so. \nSPEAKER_13:  What is also exciting, I got to talk about takeaway from Anthony's presentation part, is that our crisis intervention specialist attended one of the most successful sessions. They gave input, learned about this program, and stayed in touch. And so, when those jobs were posted, they were the first to get the first one to stand. And I was really excited to have someone from the community to sit along with her in this time. And then we are now at our pilot program. So, from all of the learning that have happened over the last few years, we've developed these things that they will be viable. \nSPEAKER_13:  aware of just how we work through some of the hiring processes. As a last Friday, the entire team is on board during the training. \nSPEAKER_13:  And I am so excited. I'm going to the next slide. \nSPEAKER_13:  As I mentioned, we have a work first that has been continuously meeting for the last two years. Along the spring right now, or in the example of the data development set has been important to work. And the partnerships are very real enough. We couldn't do this without the support of our government and the disbushes that have made it. They really are advocating the needs of this program so very much that they're trying very hard to figure out all the in-the-nouth technology that is needed. What trends do you mean? And what kind of ways are we shaking support us? And they're just to cut all our partners. Library services, employees, or libraries, or whatever they're in government, because they've received the community and can reflect what the team would make out of it and what kind of ways are we able to support. \nSPEAKER_13:  One more and one more please? \nSPEAKER_13:  But brings us to our theme and title. \nSPEAKER_13:  So I've mentioned the team and the addition of data and analysis. Enjoying the 2022 working of JPL or government support class. \nSPEAKER_13:  But you have what Paul would be a little more Japanese talk about and whether those calls happening was often \nSPEAKER_13:  And what part of the scenario happened to yourself? \nSPEAKER_13:  because we knew that we were limited to one team of three responders and our city is just big enough that we knew we could get across town reasonably in the middle of traffic. If you're not traveling with life in sirens, to be as \nSPEAKER_13:  Green of the Service to the community. So you think one highway area, which we play in on West Division, that will our data show us, that West Division have the highest number of calls concentrated within their boundaries during the hours of ten and a half. \nSPEAKER_13:  So that is what I'm going to be providing for kind of bias as well as this team of the parliament. Again, based in data, we are also very open to you, re-visiting what the calls for centers are showing. \nSPEAKER_13:  We're also going to be great about discussion and partnership because I think that calls are coming in outside of those hours those days enough division they will be marking with a different system. \nSPEAKER_13:  call that could be eligible. So when we are ready to stay up, we'll know what division and what time you extend to because they've been tracking it all along. \nSPEAKER_13:  Lastly, I'm going to show you a grand map. Additionally, the team will be refining the team that's available. We'll be not late to the sentence because they will not be high on their call. And again, we can have a direct speech with that. Please don't touch. \nSPEAKER_13:  Lastly, the team will be really cognizant of the possible activation of Sarah's dimension, or Team Genoform will look nothing like 3-4 fires, and will look very different from some kind of our other thought-rich teams so that it's very clear that this is the compete crisis of all. \nSPEAKER_13:  Not to be confused with the new year, I'll be showing you how. Very bright colors, but if you've seen that, it's posted right goodbye. \nSPEAKER_13:  So that's how you want me to get this picture. \nSPEAKER_13:  Mobile Center \nSPEAKER_05:  you need this bachelor's partner, we'll be sending call to CCR team to respond for multiple services. Call that are eligible for diversion, we'll be called that are under the Code of Mental Health crisis, talking about non-violent mental health crisis considering folks who may be experiencing panic, maybe some going to the next one, some suicidal like Haitian, and various different crises that folks may experience based on different factors that happen in life or in other ways. We'll also be responding to public and constant huge inculcations which is to look like somebody just during the day, potentially having any number of substance or be someone after a party, someone calls in, hey I see someone, that goes to be the EDG out of the chat, that's what happens to us. I'll welcome a person, somebody who's maybe in the area, potentially you may consider this something like voidering, this president, maybe somebody called them. \nSPEAKER_05:  AJ \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  All fair check. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  somebody pulls it and says hey I heard my grandmother talking to me. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm not able to go there. We may be able to, instead of the least, to be able to make up little fairs, I can see what's going on, people to connect services, as well as general disturbances. On this one, we've faced the two parts, but really we're looking at times where individuals may call them because they heard a lot of noise. They heard kids in the street, and they were concerned about safety, about quality, about things like that, and they went out and made that connection talk with folks and potentially the escalated situation. That wasn't actually violent to be human. However, we do have some exclusionary factors. So dispatch will not send us calls at the person that's being violent behavior. So direct aggressive behavior, something that could potentially cause fall to be longer talking about. Person's possession of a weapon, be that any type of weapon, if somebody calls in and says, hey, calling about one of the top items, but I know that person has possession of them. Whether that be a good or a bad thing, they just have it. They will send us without LB send out to PD, it's a high arrest situation. The person that's being in medical emergency, our team will have a public health nurse on its staff. We've hired them a day, on more than just like we see I mentioned, but we're not necessarily the team to respond to medical emergency that will be escalated to a human that's response. If someone's threatening our human and risk of self hurting others, that's also a high arrest situation. Or if anybody is a victim, we're not a law enforcement unit. We will not be carrying handcuffs, on anything at all that would help into law enforcement aspect. You're there to provide credit. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, and I'll see you next time. \nSPEAKER_05:  So this image here is very simplistic design of what 911 dispatch would have looked like, maybe looks like in this moment right now. And when we flip the switch and see CR being dispatched to the community, we're a little bit in the future. As you can see, there's a two branch approach. Someone called 911, something's going on, dispatch picks up, they have to question. And these are good dispatched to the needs of fire. Oh, that's R team of being dispatched by PV. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll be adding one more round. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  We're in category fits within our eligibility, exclusionary characters, and within our time in, service area will be sent out in our band with us. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  So this is a brief structure of what people look like. I have a program manager of this team. I have overseed the development of the CCR team. Both working with the CCR R2 work group. I'm working with some of those data challenges, data conversations that Chris and I have mentioned. Really trying to look at the data to improve and iterate the program to those gaps that we may not have noticed at the beginning. But with the data you can see, but we're not necessarily meeting the specific area. We want to make sure that folks \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm going to say Daniel is amazing. He oversees the daily operations of the team. So we're working directly with the CCR staff, working on creating guidelines. He's also the process of being cleared for LPS designation, which allows him to do 51 and 50 holes. If that were to be necessary, so we have another tool box. It's not necessarily what we're trying to do as our first step. It's one of those things that he wants to make sure everything has in case of an emergency. On top of that, he's also just an employer, 10.5. He said, and we have three field response folks. Allison is a crisis intervention specialist. She was the one who was involved in inter-healing listening sessions. She is our mental health clinician and crisis intervention specialist, who will be there to provide mental health support, mental education, de-escalation support. We have our health responder or public health nurse Jeff. They'll be there to provide support on the kind of work. Medical, light triage, light wound care, health education, some medication management conversations, really making sure that we'll be able to camp a full person, not just walking away from the crisis, but asking the additional questions about how the person is doing. Sometimes a crisis on a medical bench, a little very similar. I know that sometimes we did a training in panic, you can feel the car. And you may not know that. So we asked questions on multiple fronts to make sure that we're actually addressing the person as a whole person, not just the student that we know the answer based on our mental health experience. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Additionally, a care navigator, Val, who is there to provide resource support in that peer connection. They have lived experience and they are able to really talk to the person as a person, not come out of the lens, and really being the center of our team. \nSPEAKER_05:  If that's the next one, we have a lot of training. Some of these have completed, some of these are scheduled, some of these are literally being talked about pasted today. It's a long before bucket, we look at general training, mental health trainings, health training, and kind of scene training. All of these are necessary professionally to help work that, to make sure they have the expertise they need in the field. We did higher practice for these, so we know we have it. \nSPEAKER_05:  We also want to reach that further. \nSPEAKER_05:  So how that works, how the same language. Everyone on the team is being trained on a PVC and situational awareness to make sure that both are seen out there, that they're able to identify one thing to get in unsafe, so that we can potentially ask for support for things to get in situ. But at the end of the day, this is not an all-inclusive list. There's actually more being added to this. And so the change is, depending on what our needs are and conversations we have, but it isn't to give it a type of training that we're trying to intentionally bring into our space, it makes better to have. \nSPEAKER_05:  go ahead and pass them outside. For some of you who had mentioned the data, this is a little bit of a data we're collecting. It's also not the whole list. We're probably the list that's flying show, being much longer. But some of the pieces of data that we're looking to capture include the number of people serve, really breaking them down into different kind of demographic areas, are response time. How long does it take for us to get out there? We're in one division, but traffic, various things happen. And we want to make sure we're getting to a crisis within a reasonable time period called closure. How long does it take us when we arrive on the scene? So work with an individual and close the scene to a one's stability, care, leave it just if it happened to me and you can say to be active at the scene, or potentially transport support the person at a different level. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're graphic information, collaboration with first responders. That one's key. We're not designed to be working in co-responsive first responders on their recall. This guy is calling us and I'm calling us Anne Police calling us Anne Fire. They're calling us directly. But there may be times where we unintentionally or unintentionally will be on scene with fire, with police because this is extremely tough and sancers. So understanding what that looks like, as well as just the type of resources or referrals that we commonly make, if you resource your role for not making, and staff attention. What is our skin look like? How is it grown? What demographics do we have? And our team, what experiences, culture, expertise do we have? And where do we have potential to bring? \nSPEAKER_05:  of the next slide. And this is kind of getting to the end here. We are on a countdown to launch. So this is a quick story. This house in last Friday, we had our last new hires come in. We completed their onboarding. They are in the office. They are getting ready for work. We are finalizing our policies and procedures or guidelines just to make sure that we have a case of correct knowledge, the correct wording, the correct instruction for folks that we're not putting anyone in harm. And we have the right conversation before we actually go out into the work. We actually purchase all our supplies, our most of our supplies, our emergency vehicle, but finishing that up, having the conversation, we shouldn't miss anything to do for a while with them the last two photos. We want to make sure we have there. But we're completing all the trainings. We prioritize many of the trainings before the launch date. But there will be a few that happen. After the fact that the learning and education isn't at one time thing you don't learn, and you're done, it's a lifelong process. And we understand that we'll continually need to refresh and make sure that folks have updated information. So we'll complete the priority training and continue training as we go to work. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then we'll launch. So we have a tentative launch, soft launch coming. End of April, we're going to start doing outreach in the community. Because we're going to go to the community partners and talk. We're looking at a main screen launch time to actually get dispatch calls. PV dispatch calls us and we go out to the community. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's exciting for us. \nSPEAKER_05:  I will protect real-time. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Welcome, good evening, welcome back in, so we can move to public comment. So very much here. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I want Mexico to receive theosition that \nSPEAKER_01:  Move his motions! Down, second! \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I'm going to move to public comment and then we'll move to a commissioner question \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  I feel okay. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_12:  And now you can ask, we can ask questions after. And we'll all work. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would recommend sharing your questions at the part of your comments and we'll try to note them down so we can ask your questions. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  So, um, some involve the listen to the very beginning, um, before I think you guys are very dispecating. A lot of us still register students, uh, you know, right hand girl, right? Um, we were talking about this for so long, and it seems that it's a city. This is all nice and good, but it's, it's, um, a lot of the things that I do, uh, are like, I'm not gonna \nSPEAKER_12:  My experience from working with the food, where we start, area response, data centers. I mean, it's kind of seems like it's set for failure. I'm sorry to buzz you guys, but there's a couple things. Number one, I have to start about who did the 901 training, who trained the operator on which call the data decide, oh, we're going to send those over there. I want to know if you guys try to get your own number so that people can call you directly. And if you did try to do that, what's stopped that? I also want to know who was a part of that community, as far as who made these decisions. Because I was aware that it was also the police association or the police were involved as well. And what we should be need, which is exactly what we did and what we talked about in the framework for reconciliation. \nSPEAKER_12:  The tie ring. \nSPEAKER_12: \u5361\u4f4f\u4e86 \nSPEAKER_12:  10 to 5. \nSPEAKER_12:  20,000 to 5,000. \nSPEAKER_12:  When people are at school, when people are at work, when most crisis, I mean, sure, there's some things going on, and stuff like that, but you just didn't see my time frame that's gonna be when it actually needs those community. Let's see. \nSPEAKER_12:  I know about the cohort you guys are with and stuff like that, but that cohort actually, before it started, went to the Whitsky level program so they could learn how to have that cohort, how to implement that program you guys with. So it's kind of backwards because you guys are on top with the loose. Before you guys came on, sorry, I'm talking from the beginning of all the structure of the program. The city is already in, they talked with the loose, they talked with all these other people before they disinterprete, we're so long and a lot of these things that I heard you guys have implemented are exactly what these successful models. Ten years, one year, thirty years, that game of success, I have said it's not going to work. I also have decided about the next, the most practice learning where you have is able to get medications because that's one thing that is done. I think it's a lot of time that I've got on the street, I've got a house, I can still, and I need COVID and just basic things. \nSPEAKER_12:  Is there a facility for the program? I hear about like, earlier the van, something that happened to where they didn't feed, where they didn't even stay. And it's very disheartening that the city couldn't even put a yellow light on top of the hood today. I mean, the water company, the gas company, and other people who don't park wherever they want and put their yellows on the yellow light. I'll be saying, warning, something's happening, kind of give us a courtesy. Doesn't mean move about the way, but we pay them a courtesy. We can't even get a courtesy light. Your response time isn't going to be, we're talking about, you know, well, actually between 10 and 5 years, I've never been distracted from the city. Also, it just seems bad. \nSPEAKER_12:  The program is the same structure. \nSPEAKER_12:  All right. Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Can you remind me your name? \nSPEAKER_12:  Can you remind me your name? I don't see you. I can't really believe it. It's not a short job. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  This is the go-off couple years now. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we sure \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, we would love that. Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  other public comment. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you for the presentation. It's a sample website. It's a form of a title site. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm going to put it all for this presentation on the website. And if I email you, can you come to me, my social justice groups, or my family groups, and be the same presentation for educational purposes? Educational purposes. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Any other Apple comments? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, ding nun, we'll go ahead and close out public comment and move to Commissioner questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can I get some picture? \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  for \nSPEAKER_03:  uh... when the public comment \nSPEAKER_03:  It's okay for staff and the commission to respond. It's not a case to engage in a discussion about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  All the public, right? Oh. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_03:  That way you guys don't have to capture other questions. I know that can be a lot. So it's okay if you acknowledge and respond to the questions. It's the discussion that we don't want happening. \nSPEAKER_03:  The discussion risks violating the Brown Act because there's a lot of potential to get away from what the agenda item is. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Very, very quickly and very simple. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that is very always been taught to just not. Yeah, but it's better to know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, but it's better to not. But staff seem to be acknowledging like some of the questions that they have answered to the community. So you can give them that opportunity if you'd like. But again, no discussion. It's a direct response or no response. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Perfect and I did capture all of your questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  You \nSPEAKER_04:  I got some of them. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have some of this. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you want to answer Bill's question, I think, is the last question that was on the floor if you can present at other community. \nSPEAKER_13:  That's the result of a presentation that's not a visible result yet, so we absolutely can present it any other way. \nSPEAKER_13:  and just regardless. \nSPEAKER_01:  Ha ha ha! \nSPEAKER_01:  Great, thank you. I'm going to move to Commissioner questions. And if some of those questions you had to get answered, I'll mark them up, but I did note them down. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Ah! \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, so I wrote them down to you. So I do have a couple of similar questions. And then we can go back to those other questions. So. \nSPEAKER_07:  The 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. piece I am sure is because of staff staffing. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, you only start in small group of people. \nSPEAKER_07:  But when you are going through data, were you finding that that time, 10 to 5 time, had more of these kinds of calls? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_13:  So I get the all-homes, pull that the all-in-disclash, and through those, looking at the whole tights. And then if there is a exclusionary, it's that those calls for happening, those free-wording are in that type. \nSPEAKER_07:  and will your team be going out in groups of just 1-1 or groups of 2 or 3 together? \nSPEAKER_13:  and we'll be going on in the next three. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. My other question about this and it's a little off that other topic is. \nSPEAKER_07:  I know that PD has a new division in core and they're doing similar work. \nSPEAKER_07:  in a very different way. So, will there be connections between those teams? Will there be, I mean trainings and or? \nSPEAKER_07:  Because I would love to see a lot of the trains you had here go over in that direction too. Will that kind of work of data collecting also be put together? \nSPEAKER_13:  I'll take your phone and bring the phone. Sorry. So, would you tell me the training? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  So we have been working with the technical overseas event teams. They're helping us with our scenes at the ESU Universes. And all of the trainings that we have had, they are also tested in and we're providing that information, either having them join us or provide enough for them. So there is definitely what happened, we've read a public health list of the work that we do, right? And so we wanted to share that whenever possible. \nSPEAKER_13:  And I'm stuck in these kind of things around here, and I think I've also looked at it. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, so will you be sharing data between the calls about these things so you can see more closely if there are other times or dates that you should be available and those kinds of things? \nSPEAKER_13:  So that is going to be a long-loving process of primary data strategy. It's not worth, this is not a, this is it. This is a done deal. There's a living, growing, iterative process. And I did a strategy of a little stuff all types. Where are they coming from? Are we getting the right calls? \nSPEAKER_13:  In service, the right time. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  As of right now, the assumption is yes, the theory is yes, right? That is what we see. \nSPEAKER_13:  And then the next three months of the launch, if that's not it, the team is already so aware of their care to adjust their service. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Now we want to do a soccer. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that the hope is that as we're out in the community and we're sharing more of all this resource, that people will go more comfortable calling 911, and so that we want in it, you know, a lot of people are exhibiting behavioral health issues, but we hope that people can... \nSPEAKER_02:  feel more comfortable just trusting that it's working. And so we hope to see that some different types of data collection points. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would just be honest as a community member, I would really love you guys to have your own phone number because as a person is driving around during the day and I see someone exhibiting signs of, you know, taking out their clothes in the middle of the street. And they, I've called and asked for the care team and the care team has never shown up first. It's always been other teams. So I just, I would love it if you guys could have a number that people could call. But is that in the works? \nSPEAKER_13:  I wanted to do a discussion, but you want to have a question about the fashion. So you can talk for that. Oh, yeah, yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  So you can... \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh! \nSPEAKER_09:  I know. Did you answer your question? I did say that. I did. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Merci. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ha ha! \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Just a Health pessimist. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's a camera too! \nSPEAKER_03:  So scary. Ralph Brown is all gonna come to you. \nSPEAKER_08:  \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544, \uc544 \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ha ha! \nSPEAKER_04:  Ha ha ha! \nSPEAKER_04: \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0627\u0646\u3057\u3087 \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  But that's the one again. So for those ainda musnas \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  So that is something I would love to scale to, but we want you to really, really listen, and then we have one man, we have one to use, and we want to make sure that the color that we're coming out of still address, because if we only time to us the real of the reality with it, they'd be stuck. \nSPEAKER_13:  all they want and by the time that the youth 20 falls back. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_13:  And then what happens to the 19th of August? You want to make sure you don't wear a additional arm to this response? \nSPEAKER_13:  that we are still responding to our communities and there isn't that stacking of houses. \nSPEAKER_13:  That's something we work with to discuss. So we have our discussion around here. You're sharing this. Our day's failed. We're learning from students and from youth. \nSPEAKER_13:  The drama is my last\u611f \nSPEAKER_13:  We're learning how to treat our new goals so that they can get here as often as they need. \nSPEAKER_13:  Everybody Einstein \nSPEAKER_13:  In the cold, tight, is the literal procedure and we're like, we'll have enough of waiting to go. \nSPEAKER_13:  So that's what I change it because we know these things can change for themselves. \nSPEAKER_13:  Give out changes and now become fairers. \nSPEAKER_13:  Here in the yard. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  You're gonna change your clothes, huh? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  We want to make sure some of you there are some hidden guide paths, all of you know, lighten the cycle, get to where they need to keep up for us and safe. \nSPEAKER_13:  That's about 800, you just don't have to say it. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Our hope is. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  This is what they're doing with triple contact, is that we can scale so that we can get our numbers of countable teams. \nSPEAKER_13:  about stacking a pole. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Any other questions? Can I share in a couple? \nSPEAKER_09:  on migrant advocates. \nSPEAKER_09:  Chili and papaya, \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm going to go to the corner of Manhattan and not be further away. \nSPEAKER_09:  There are many, many, many people who want to reach you. \nSPEAKER_09:  And wouldn't even doubt it, well, because I have to go through that tree. \nSPEAKER_09:  They don't want to call 911, they don't want to call where they could get through all the people there. So I would like to... \nSPEAKER_09:  George, will you request then? \nSPEAKER_09:  You have your own dispatch number whenever it takes. \nSPEAKER_09:  and we can put it up in our building. \nSPEAKER_09:  that this call this for mental health non-violent would just be fantastic. And I'm so cursed and so happy to hear it. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Make sure to\u7d30\u7bc0aws well together! \nSPEAKER_09: applause that all right \nSPEAKER_04:  I want to echo that comment as well and I think of in the times that I've had to call them in one before, right? The first question is, please are fire. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so I'm wondering as an initial question, how within the service area are, is 911 going to be trained to say police fire or crisis response? \nSPEAKER_04:  I obviously are taking call all across the city, so I mean, I guess there's a technical challenge, but how even from the start are we Identifying if this is a third option for general public \nSPEAKER_13: \u8a5e\u66f2 \nSPEAKER_04:  And then, again, in that kind of follow-up of quality control, is there, and obviously, data is most critical in the very, very beginning, and making sure that we're anchored in the right places at the right time. So, to some of the questions of concern of even how 9-1-1 call centers are, \nSPEAKER_04:  routing calls. Is there a quality control or is there an oversight of even reviewing calls that may have gone to PD that they say, oh, this could have gone here. We missed it or so that we're looking across that that spectrum of \nSPEAKER_00:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  Hey, you know, maybe there's another problem here. We have to go back and retrain people to kind of the concern of the community that that may not be the best clearing house. I know it's maybe the only one, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  like how are we? Is there a process for that or how we're... \nSPEAKER_13:  there are \nSPEAKER_04:  how things are thinking through that. \nSPEAKER_13:  very question and that's absolutely part of the strategy in which we're playing in place. Just back to very well thinking about the process. \nSPEAKER_13:  and is very willing to participate in all of those conversations. That's about the progress we've learned from the more much better life I've done. \nSPEAKER_13:  Because that's what you think is going to happen, because that's really what's going to happen and revisiting that continuously. And that's whether it's working, meaning to train, all the way to the intake to discuss the assessments, all of that, they're very open to absolutely want us to work. And we want to make it the right to fall. \nSPEAKER_04:  And my last question was, what happens if there is more than one call that comes in? That is meant for your team. How is there a prioritization? \nSPEAKER_04:  in the response or like once you're on a call you're there until that call is completed and then it's... \nSPEAKER_04:  hopefully you can still get to the next one or how is that? \nSPEAKER_04:  process laid out. \nSPEAKER_13:  Again, great question. So it would be the latter kind of one you could describe. \nSPEAKER_13:  One of the things that are special about the alternate practice of all teams across the country is they're able to provide more high-spin for the person who works. They don't have to be pulled off by the way to go to the next one of the things. And so we want to make sure that that person will leave our seats. \nSPEAKER_13:  or save overhead to the resource. But we're getting that you'll place where you can save us. That may take some time. \nSPEAKER_13:  So that's something we're working with Ms. Sach to have constant communication with her in the radio. And then this time so that they know where we are going to get that process. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  That's why I also brought that word, T-M3. \nSPEAKER_13:  So there's no one person left with someone in crisis. And someone can leave, make those communication updates so we can see okay, do you have a call back? \nSPEAKER_13:  We are still like 40 minutes out. \nSPEAKER_13:  What is the detail of this class? And if it's something that is a global level of work, so it's not something that's been and dangerous for some of our mothers, perhaps it's been a check-aloud making him. \nSPEAKER_13: \u200b\u200b \u200bGood youngmi buat some.. Essa and my baby, it's a go-and- Tamb- Hello \nSPEAKER_13: \u6bce\u5e74\u63a8\u3057\u5408\u308f\u305b\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059 \nSPEAKER_13:  Okay, so try to figure out what that practice is. You're like, I'm going to put your own front footers. \nSPEAKER_13:  County of San Victoria. And 35. I had taught. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Commissioner Fores? Commissioner Fores? Good question. I think you've got a sub-academy which is very exciting. Regarding domestic violence, I know that you will not go anywhere where there's violence, but in the latter parts of that, when maybe there's a disturbance by an unlawful person or disturbance, period is that something you will be reacting to or 911 will smash you guys or will that still be a police? \nSPEAKER_13:  That's not part of our first phase. It's like, we should be happy to feel the challenge. Looking back up for that. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  We have five hospitals right now. There are three significant around these areas. Mental health crisis, and we'll be present. And we feel that because of our team, we need to grow into something we call. That one is going to take a little bit more of our justice and training because those calls \nSPEAKER_13:  can have you watch more of a military story. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  And we want to make sure that we are not hushed with God to get lower level of need of God before we get such a breath of God's power. \nSPEAKER_01:  En hier Ohem? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this is a lot of. First of all, thank you for the presentation. I appreciate the visuals and everything that you presented. This is in line with the reconciliation of framework. My opening comment really is to uplift. \nSPEAKER_00:  prior comments, I think the more of us that chime in here in concert with the community of having a different number, the better. \nSPEAKER_00:  Is there, and I do have to say, I think it's better if I just ask questions than a record worth it, because it's a ton of questions here. \nSPEAKER_00:  Is there money allocated from public campaigns? \nSPEAKER_00:  for community folks at large to be knowledgeable that this is happening, and this is what they need to do because to be transparent, even as a commissioner sitting on the human rights equity commission here, and I read papers and I read the post and I read everything, I, this is new information for me, so I can imagine folks who may not do what some of us do in a capacity probably are not even as aware, so is there budget in a public campaign for folks to be heard of this? \nSPEAKER_12:  That was an hammer for sand, out into that. That was a long, you tamper sand. Or a jubil, you know, about a million towards that. I'll put this out there. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  So also we question so as I mentioned because we just got our last two staff last Friday. This is kind of our first way of our awareness game. This is actually the first time out Anthony. He's also here to the team. So this is something you're working on. And also we didn't want to go too early because we didn't have staff. We didn't want to say we don't have staff yet. So we've been really intentional about. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  not say too much. So now that we have our team here ready to go. So would you have a word and say, now we have press conference in May that we are working out with City folks, several articles have been referring to come out. So it is starting to come out. And this is just the first part. \nSPEAKER_13:  Now that we're all talking about your \u015furow, Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  All that awareness is what we focused on at this point. Anthony's already focused really on doing a lot of one committee connection. So we acknowledge that the people who are doing industry source the most need to average to directly and to know the team they need to know the way because that's the team they need to do the job. And so that's something that we're talking about. And so I think it's a good thing to be able to implement these people to that. \nSPEAKER_00:  So \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. And then just one other question, then I'll have some recommendations here. \nSPEAKER_00:  The question is, am I correct in saying that regardless of what the data made you? \nSPEAKER_00:  that we are moving forward with the pilot and this will be expanded or is it contingent? \nSPEAKER_00:  on what the data is going to say. \nSPEAKER_02:  Our hope is to expand to new life. We can't say that with certainty. We are exploring other avenues for funding like counting. And the counting, of course. So we are exploring other funding routes going to rely on things for our company. But we can't say those are the two that are coming for second and expanding to new life. I'm not a model, but that is certainly irrelevant. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. It's a very well-weir of hoots and the success of the hoots. So align with that. To what degree is this pilot face? You mentioned this practice is earlier. So to what degree is this pilot face aligned with? \nSPEAKER_00:  some potential piloting that has happened to the other codes, a different model. And then I'll just do the recommendation also that's a fairly good question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Data always has lenses. Always have frameworks that inform us. Sometimes it's explicit. \nSPEAKER_01:  always have \nSPEAKER_00:  sometimes we're not aware of what is our embedded ideologies that go into data. So as we work through data, it's part of the human genitive, right? So it will be changing, right? So I think \nSPEAKER_00:  and that pretty obviously, that pretty framework in that data. \nSPEAKER_00:  to ensure that we're capturing the most sailing data possible with an effort to expand, because sometimes nothing is the case here because I haven't seen the data. But sometimes when we create survey instruments, we sometimes will lean it in a different direction. How we ask the question. What type of questions are being passed? \nSPEAKER_01:  Qu\u1ed1c, \nSPEAKER_00:  the type of words that are being selected and that will yield certain data that can then be even manipulated in the particular way. So I think the idea of having a framework and saying this is the framework that we're using to create instruments. And this is the rationale, we're going to go back to the equation framework, everybody is all over that framework. \nSPEAKER_00:  And we can then start to move forward with... \nSPEAKER_00:  The end goal, I would like to say, I will put my ideology front and center in this space and beyond, is that we need this program citywide. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  And on that note, on that note, and I understand what you've got to private and you do have your needs in that area. But one of the most unfortunate calls that sometimes happen \nSPEAKER_00:  Sometimes people call night witnesses myself in my own city, though, I've seen it. \nSPEAKER_00:  people call. \nSPEAKER_00:  on the east side of the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  when it's a person of color that I've seen it with my own eyes. And I've seen police come and I stay there to make sure that nothing extreme happens. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so even though I understand there's a private phase, some of those data is like how many people are calling another on white sides of the city just because you have a black person, a Latino, a Cambodian or someone else coming in. And that's not necessarily going to be captured in that area because that area is a people-colored area. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  So just want to kind of uplift that because you did mention that other data is going to be trapped, even though it's not following there. So on those type of incidents it's going to be trapped. \nSPEAKER_00:  When people call and people show up and go like, oh, this is a nonsense. You're just calling because someone's as black and as a neighborhood. And they probably live in the neighborhood too. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, also looking at time, we have one other item which should be a pretty short discussion, but I just want to be honest with you because it's time, but I do have just a few other questions that I didn't click at address, so I'll be quick. \nSPEAKER_01:  I did. I had a question, similarly about the work group. I know Tia had some questions about who was on the work group, but my question was around \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  expanding the worker. Is that the first is the two part? Is the worker going to continue on to help inform the implementation of the project or the initiative? And then if so, is there an opportunity to expand those members or look at \nSPEAKER_01:  at that body. \nSPEAKER_13:  So, great question. So, yes, they will be continuing to me to provide advice and advice who can have a lot of data because we'd be wanting to make sure that we power on both of mine. When's that we're coming on? We're very fortunate that we have the help that we've been using within our hero. So we do work very closely with them and we'll also have a little bit of help in general. And so, \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes, that's something that we want us to continue to do. But look at this, it's hoping that we can process it. We thought about the expansion, and I was waiting for the gasoline to come up on it, because it's in my decision that it's not something I'll be able to take on as well. But it's also part of our, it's our reason for charity. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, yeah, and I don't remember the full list, but I do remember it's feeling a little like institution heavy. And so I would recommend that that's expanded to include more community groups. I also noticed Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission had a seat at the table. But I don't think anyone from our commission does, so it's just something to think about as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm really sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  So thank you on the work group members. The other question I had as well is around the vehicle and the lights. I know there's specifically a call that there wouldn't be lights and sirens. Can you just share a little bit more about the thinking behind that? \nSPEAKER_13: \u518d\u898b \nSPEAKER_13:  I think it's actually well associated with the decision made before I joined the team. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, yeah, I would just be curious to hear if there's like a bus practice around that and like is it better or worse or because that person I thought it was like oh maybe that makes sense because you don't want people to think this is a police response. But then again, you know, there's some type of other light or whatever, the people know like this is important out of the way. So okay, and then the other question was about the nurse practitioner that would be responding is is that professional allowed to deal with medication and that kind of a response. \nSPEAKER_13:  Now, so the first one is actually public health care. A public health care. So it doesn't have anything to do with the stuff like this. Then we do, we'll have a market. On board, so we can't throw a big hand to the stuff like this. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good ball\u05dd! \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, and is there any thought into changing that model or \nSPEAKER_01:  maybe assessing if that's the right path, just before thinking about \nSPEAKER_01:  Mhm. \nSPEAKER_01:  I should say yes, is there any thought into assessing that thing? How about working within the second? If someone is in need of some type of medication, that kind of response, is that then elevated to back to paramedics or how does that work? Or how does that work? \nSPEAKER_13:  So the first question of assessing whether or not the risk of difficulty is in a street by 16. So not quite as well as showing the discrimination of the off-through for the local workers or around health education health maintenance. I have a second question. The difference is that you're on the top right now. \nSPEAKER_08: \u5750\u5427 \nSPEAKER_13:  versus the health crisis that can present as a level of solidarity. \nSPEAKER_13:  And the second factor was the first factor. \nSPEAKER_13:  does any of those crime medications and what would the process be? \nSPEAKER_13:  If they are single and it's not a burden for them, you might not have the ongoing service of your child, so we're working with finance and providers in the community. In the transiled, the medication is light dependent, but we can transport them off. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_13:  It's now. \nSPEAKER_13:  with the caveat, if they are currently in a health care ward in Z, then it exceeds the strength of the law, if you have the ability to allow it by the health partners, we would want to welcome them. \nSPEAKER_13:  If they can go to the NTS, they'll have to have that answer. Right, treat it as us. OK. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so that's why you're connected to each of those entities through your calls system. Okay, perfect. And then my last question is, what is the cost of this program? And I know you might not know it off top of your head, maybe you're truthfully not. But I'm curious, what is it cost to administer this pilot? \nSPEAKER_02:  So we currently talk about what we can't only $1, before this pilot program that should get us through about eight to a month. \nSPEAKER_01:  in just the pilot area. Is that right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the system ready for an elderly response. It'd be great if we could come up with a three-digit message. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's if ways to create new effects like this. Our pipeline allows you to export data that won't survive until you reach out to any native conservatives and communities. Moreover, it leads you to the most serious long mankind. Now to make the most June-or- Wooo Union project, as it exists in millions of years. It's rej Ninja Bet\u7df4, Settler. That requires flavor. Announcement leading \u03bd\u03b1 en ticks for the ability to promoting snows in unison to other actively beyond Japanese parts there. By stopping fear of leaps of people pushing off their territory, the U.N.E. becomes safer than it takes to punishment the close to qu Bla-op. So like every lestleness goes too far in front of us. \nSPEAKER_06:  that's easy. \nSPEAKER_06:  a park with this half of the \nSPEAKER_06:  the thoughts around 9-1-1 might have for some questions. You're starting with 1, 1, 3, 4. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  supports Facebook. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we have, we're not wrapping up of the 17 of those. Good to know. And then where do you dispatch from? \nSPEAKER_06:  So, I'll be at the cover. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  So actually our team is housed currently at the housing authority in Long Beach, mostly logistically because of the space that we can close and we can housing vehicles safely. We have actually received the vehicle get where the temporary vehicle at the moment, but our vehicle is clean and summer, and we need to help that. And we also have a little bit of a space. \nSPEAKER_02:  issue with the health department, not a lot of space in our facilities at the moment. And so that's where we are at the moment. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_07:  I, uh, this is my share of Erickson. I just wanted to say, um, that I know there's a couple more questions from that came from our public comment. I would just offer that anybody can go to this email and send some questions to you, I assume, Anthony, and, um, and go to other opportunities to see you guys are connected. Thank you for coming and doing public comment. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Hey, come on, we got a roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner false. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye, Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can have a little session today. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we do have one more item. It should be a quick one in this item number four."
