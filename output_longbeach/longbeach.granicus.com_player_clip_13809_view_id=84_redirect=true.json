        "transcript": "SPEAKER_06:  agenda item here as we move forward so can I have the clerk read the next agenda item? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, item two is a recommendation to discuss city attorney's draft of equity and human relations commission by laws. \nSPEAKER_06:  Alright, so as I mentioned in my opening comments, my hunch is that this is going to \nSPEAKER_06:  provide probably be the bulk of our discussion for today. It's hard to predict what's certainly the entire future, but I think there's a reason why this is a agenda item number one. So I kind of wanted it up for general comments. And first, I'll do for anyone who haven't been to pop up online. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  So if there's no one online, then we can go straight to discussion. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can I ask the attorney, Taylor Anderson, if there's anything else that you want to add in addition to the process in addition to perhaps what I said at the beginning? \nSPEAKER_01:  So thank you chair. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've had robust discussions in the time that I've spent with you over a period of time. During that time, I've taken notes on the feedback that you've given me. I am hopeful that I have captured what you're doing here and what the intent is of this commission and the way that you operate. \nSPEAKER_01:  So, overtime. \nSPEAKER_01:  All of those little notes should be captured here. If they're not, please let me know. Editions that we may be haven't discussed yet in great detail. Were the community agreements? The community agreements were proposed by the equity office staff. The things that would be a good fit for this commission. It was something that we had talked about last time. The other thing of note in this document is it's uniquely drafted with the opportunity at each officer election for there to be either a co-chair structure or a chair vice chair structure to be determined at each election, which will happen on an annual basis. So I'm available for questions. I know we had issues with the agenda today. Tony is grabbing hard copies for you to make this discussion a little bit easier. It is also available online if you have laptops on you today. Just let me know what you need and how I can support you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think it also would be helpful for knowledge base fellow commissioners is any recommendations or just comments that are made for our own FYI tailor. How will this be captured? Like what is the note taking process so we know that? But the next meaning, what to expect? \nSPEAKER_01:  So this isn't a draft today that you could adopt if you decide that this document reflects the rules that you want to apply to this commission. If not, I just need consensus from the entire body that you're in agreement to the changes that need to be made to this document. So we can have a discussion. You can take a motion at the end once there's been a discussion, identifying the things that either need to be changed about this document or, yeah, they need to be changed. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think. \nSPEAKER_01:  what we need from the commission is feedback. If you need more time to really digest what this document says, that's okay too. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that there's a lot of information here, but yeah, so it would be consensus building at this point and then I would just ask that someone makes a motion to capture what the will of the body is that you can vote on. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think would also be helpful and I shared it in brief in my opening comments but now that we're at this agenda item I can go a little bit further detail if it's helpful so Vice chair coming to an eye Red and earlier draft And then both of us combed through it to ensure that feedback that you all gave Well, we are that one I would have just been recommendation since there was no draft at that point to be technical here and Make sure that comments were made a lot based on like I made a comment on co-chair Point and another recommendations and then tailored a next and job of taking our feedback and then providing us with another draft We revise that again and then Send us back this particular version. So there's been a twice comb over just between vice chair and myself And now this is one so excited bring it up to the entire body so that we can actually do a more thorough job to ensure That this is either the document we want as bylaws or Have comments just like by share Covington and I did earlier this month to ensure that that's captured up here So and I know that it probably takes a few minutes for us to digest such a bulky document But I will turn it over to the body And or and I know you're part of what is the advice check on me too. There's anything you want to add in terms of framing that I may have omitted \nSPEAKER_06:  from there. \nSPEAKER_01:  So something that I can add, the other commissions do, as a way to provide feedback. \nSPEAKER_01:  is what we can do in the alternative is send you all a word version of this document and then you can redline it. And what we would do is we would create one PDF, lay the item over to the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then we basically would create \nSPEAKER_01:  a giant packet of red lines so that you could see what everybody's feedback is and then make a decision on the changes at that time too. Sometimes that's more helpful of actually being able to edit the document. You don't have to do it that way, but that is an option. If we do that, that means that we're likely having a short discussion today and deferring the discussion to the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want to point out that \nSPEAKER_02:  printed copy is missing pages. Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, Tony's printing you off. I'm happy. OK, that's what you're referencing. Yes, we had printing issues today. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's what you're saying. Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  technology is not always on our side, but it is being resolved. It would be best maybe to table this item and come back to it once we have a full copy would that be better? \nSPEAKER_06:  So do we have a rough estimate? I mean, we're going to table it towards the end if... \nSPEAKER_06:  We would love to at least start the process today. \nSPEAKER_06:  die Frau k specifyway. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think if we can table this item for right now and continue with the other agenda items, hopefully Tony will be back in time to pick this back up. And then we can \nSPEAKER_01:  the commission can decide how it wants to move forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, so we'll just wait for Tony and then we'll move forward with some of the other items. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. Do I need to have a motion on that for procedures sake or we can just move forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  If there's no objection, we can move forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, come and share your bets. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just have a question. You mentioned the red lining. If we were to move forward with reviewing the document and then tabling for the next meeting, is it possible to house it in a Google doc so then as we make our changes you see all the commissioners edits and then it's just one life document instead of you having a \nSPEAKER_04:  put it all together. I don't know if that's possible. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would love to be able to do that for you. However, Ralph Brown has very strong opinions about all of you sharing one document together. So we can't do that as much as I would, it's so much more work to do it this way, but the public can't participate in that process. So we have to take the long way if we decide to do a community red line. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Bats, I appreciate the recommendation because I had also recommended that in between meetings and of course it's a brown, as we're learning more and more about the brown, especially for new commissioners here, there are certain things that we wouldn't be able to do. So I think the suggestion to have a bunch of redlining documents correct, that's what it was when the suggestions. I'm very much open to that if this is what this body would like to proceed once we get the full copy of the bylaws in these chambers. I will say, just from my own experience in this past month that would just the two of us and the staff, the back and forth was, it's time sensitive. So just kind of keep that under consideration when we navigate this discussion. Sometimes it might be best to have that discussion live, and then have the recommendations ready to go but in the meeting so that \nSPEAKER_06:  Taylor Anderson can move those recommendations into the next iteration of the bylaws. And speaking of bylaws, I see Tony just to enter the chambers here. Tony, do we have who copies of those bylaws now? We do. Do you mind sharing them? Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I also want to know Commissioner Schultz welcome. Thank you. He just joined us so well for the record. He's in attendance here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  and please join us up here. \nSPEAKER_06:  Da hat er schon sieht. \nSPEAKER_07:  out there. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think so. \nSPEAKER_06:  So a recommendation. We'll share it, but let me... Let's do it. \nSPEAKER_06:  There must be some gremlins in the copy machine here because I think with some of us still not printing out the entire copy. So we have a recommendation here. I'm going to see if the commissioners would be open to this recommendation. If we were to take five minutes, five minutes to ensure that everyone has a copy and those that do have a copy, maybe take time to review, make some notes. Is that an acceptable recommendation? \nSPEAKER_06:  everyone. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, and is that something we can do procedurally? \nSPEAKER_06:  Right, okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I have, I'm at the 30, well, what can you see here? It's almost seven, so why don't we do 705? 705 and that should give us enough time for those of us who need copies to bring them right back and those of us who have maybe can share and, you know, entertain what recommendations we want to provide, right? And think that's fair, right? Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Who has a full copy? \nSPEAKER_06:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  It's australianian. So, \nSPEAKER_06:  You \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to run up to my office. It seems to be the printer on their floor, so I will be back shortly. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Want all of these to be out on text faster? \nSPEAKER_07:  9 \nSPEAKER_06:  Another recommendation I can provide is we're waiting for those of us who have access to laptops and you might be able to access them there But I want or your phones that that works to while we wait for the part copies. I know that's Not necessarily always Accessible for everyone and I'm very aware of that But I just want to make you the recommendation just to cut corners here on time \nSPEAKER_00:  here. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair, are you asking for an official five-minute recess or are you going to continue the meeting and just wait for the copies? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Let's do 5. \nSPEAKER_06:  five minute recess I think would probably be the best better course of action just make official thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so you're gonna break for a five minute recess. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  and this back on if I can refer to our clerk tonight if we can get out of recess for the general public. \nSPEAKER_00:  You are back live, Chair. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right. So the copy, Gremlins, have been out of the copy machine. We finally have copies. All the commissioners have one in front. Okay. And I know those of us who had either copy online or happen to have a full copy earlier have had a moment to hopefully take a look. But for those commissioners who are just putting their eyes on this for the first time, please, please take the time you need during this discussion to review. And then whenever you're ready to engage us in the discussion with recommendations or questions \nSPEAKER_06:  for Taylor Anderson, let us know because my hope, right? My hope is that if this is ready the day, great. My hunch is that we all have our input as we should, but only by the next meeting have a draft that is ready to go based on recommendations that come out of this meeting. Does that sound like a plan? All right. So I'm going to go ahead and open up the... \nSPEAKER_06:  speaking time for any commissioners that have questions, recommendations, or need guidance on how to make a recommendation because I will admit, since this is the first time we're creating bylaws, it's a process into itself. So I do want to create a, I don't like calling it a safe space, I call it a brave space, right? Which is a little bit of safety, right? But also risk taking to say, hey, this is an idea, but I don't know how to word it. That's okay, right? That's why we have an expert here that can help us with the big ideas and making sure that it buys by Brown Act requirements, legalies, and anything else that goes into this process. And I really appreciate Taylor Anderson for being here. So I'm going to refer to Commissioner Bats who I have on cue here. Commissioner Bats. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not quite sure how to make this recommendation, but I believe it would go under Article number five, which is meetings. One of the things that I'm noticing is the lack of attendance. But I think we have a lack of attendance because these meetings are not being promoted to my knowledge, like where I see them either on social media or on our Councilman's newsletters that go out weekly. And so my recommendation, under meetings, \nSPEAKER_04:  if there would be a section of advertisement or advocacy or promotion of the meeting. And it should go out when we receive our information from Tony. I think it should be going out to the public because I think we're, you know, remiss at this point. Whereas I don't think everyone is \nSPEAKER_04:  getting the information that we're hosting these meetings. And so the recommendation would be to add some sort of \nSPEAKER_04:  Advertisement or advocacy under the meeting section. And I don't know if that's us partnering with our council people and they're adding it to their newsletter. \nSPEAKER_04:  or if it's something that staff would put out and we could then further promote it on social media. But the recommendation is to add some form of advertisement of these monthly meetings for the public to join. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, Commissioner Bats. Based on that recommendation, is there any comment from Taylor regarding if that's possible? And if so, how would that be built into by-laws? And is that a space for, or is that a recommendation of space for by-laws? Can you guide us on that? \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  The most attorney answer I can give you is it depends. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? So... \nSPEAKER_01:  If what you're saying is that you want commissioners to promote the meetings. \nSPEAKER_01:  then that makes sense for it to be in the bylaws, right? This is a document that regulates your conduct. We have a couple things that regulate what staff is going to do. Staff has agreed to it. If that's what you're saying, then we can make space for it. If what you're asking is for city staff to do it, that's a different ask and a different discussion. And then the only thing that I would ask you to be mindful of is if we're engaging in social media stuff, which is totally fine. Being mindful of the Brown Act when you're doing it. And then... \nSPEAKER_01:  The other big issue is when you start using your personal social media for public business, you can incidentally create public account and then the rules that apply to saving posts and archiving them and now it's a public record. Now you can't just block people, you have to have a valid reason under the social media policy to block people. So there's a little bit more involved with you promoting yourselves on social media, not that you can't do it. We just need to move forward in a very thoughtful way of it's not as easy as just promoting it on social media. You all would have to be aware of the other rules and implications that come along with it. \nSPEAKER_06:  So let me ask this, is it possible within the confines of whatever parameters we need to follow, mostly legal, to create a new system? \nSPEAKER_06:  a social media account that is the office of equity and human relations commissions is that possible. \nSPEAKER_01:  So my understanding and I don't treat so please chime in here. My understanding and my experience to other commissions is the city generally prefers for anything \nSPEAKER_01:  City related to go out of its social media accounts just because the public \nSPEAKER_01:  It's kind of like a legistar, right? The public knows that legistar is the place to go if you want to see an agenda for a meeting, same with the specific social media handles for the city. So generally, if something is to be promoted, it goes out through those accounts. That way, the public doesn't have to, you know, between the departments and all the commissions, we have, it's a lot of people to follow. So it would need to get approval through that mechanism, which is outside of my purview. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for clarifying. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_06:  other recommendations for the mission either on what was just said or something completely separate and impending in terms of feedback when they look I see Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Excuse me. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Bats, did you have a second comment? Okay, so Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_08:  Awesome. So I have a digital version, so I was making a bunch of notes. So is there a preferred way to kind of walk through some of these questions that I have? \nSPEAKER_08:  Just go pay to buy pigs. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, maybe we should go one by one talk through just \nSPEAKER_08:  We should go. \nSPEAKER_01:  My brain, my brain tends to not remember things past a certain point. I want to make sure we get to everything. \nSPEAKER_08:  My brain. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, it's one of the richest questions and then others are our potential changes. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  So looking at page two, article two. \nSPEAKER_08:  Blit 4. \nSPEAKER_01:  Presiding Officer. \nSPEAKER_08:  correct. So there's a reference to a chair pro-10 in the absence of the aforementioned officers. It's also a reference later in the leadership section. \nSPEAKER_08:  Currently what we've done and the commission of the others are helping with this. We've typically just been like the longest serving person that just jumps in automatically. So with this designation, is that something we elect with the chair and the coach here's up the same time and that's a standing like third and line type of person or is that a \nSPEAKER_08:  something different, like a meeting by meeting type, because I saw kind of reference to know there was a little bit of both in each so I wasn't sure what that process looked like. \nSPEAKER_01:  So Chair Pro Tem is in the event the Chair Vice Chair, both co-chairs, whatever is elected aren't available in that meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  person is appointed. \nSPEAKER_01:  to be the chair to run the meeting in the commission appoints. \nSPEAKER_01:  by vote that person. If what you're saying is that you automatically want it to default to the longest serving member, we could make that change. But typically how it's handled \nSPEAKER_01:  You vote in that meeting based off of who's present, of who would be the best person to run the meeting. \nSPEAKER_08:  got it. And just for the I don't have a particular preference, I was just curious because that that was a new \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  a new edition. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  So now page three. \nSPEAKER_08:  bullet 4 which is advocacy. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then this will correlate to what I receive as a conflict, but I'm not sure on page 13. So when we're talking about advocacy here, it's very explicit in saying that all members of the commission are authorized to advocate on behalf of the commission once we've adopted a position, but then moving over to page 13. \nSPEAKER_08:  Where? \nSPEAKER_08:  Now I lost my spot. So we're talking about recommendations to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_08:  that very last paragraph gets into a conversation of just the chair and the co-chairs being able to advocate in that interim period. \nSPEAKER_08:  The way that I read the advocacy section at the beginning of the document was that once we've approved it, we as commissioners have full authority to go start advocating, but the way that I read what's on page 13 feels as though there is some interim step where only the chair or the co-chairs are eligible to be that advocate. \nSPEAKER_01:  which paragraph on page 13? \nSPEAKER_08:  So I am on... \nSPEAKER_08:  the second to last paragraph. \nSPEAKER_01:  So, G, the commission requests that any staff report? \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  correct that the last paragraph in that G section. \nSPEAKER_08:  So before providing a recommendation, a city council that is different from the commission, the commission liaison has to inform the co-chair. So maybe it's the one right before. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this is specific. \nSPEAKER_01:  to your request during the facial technology. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  issue in discussion that we had. So this is in the event that a paper recommendation is being made to the City Council. So staff would inform the chair or co-chairs in that instance. Hey. \nSPEAKER_01:  There are changes here, right? So. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  What this is saying is if you asked for a recommendation and something is going to happen that you have not agreed to or that you did not ask for, the chair and the co-chairs will be notified. It doesn't change the right for anyone to advocate. What I was hoping to do in this section is reflect your intent that one \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendations that are sent to the city council are done one in a timely manner and two \nSPEAKER_01:  at your request to the city manager without any additional input from the city manager in that document. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  And this last paragraph was basically saying, if any of those things are not going to happen that the commission asked for that the chair and the co-chairs are notified. \nSPEAKER_08:  got it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I can improve on this language if it's confusing for you and talk around this idea a little bit more and bring it back. \nSPEAKER_01:  because we don't want that. If I'm not here and someone else is in my seat, we wanna be able to capture. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right. What your intent was. \nSPEAKER_08:  What? \nSPEAKER_08:  because this is clear to just the written documents that we're talking about then, so not just the general recommendation we would make on something, but a physical written letter that we're sending, or in that case of the facial recognition technology, a whole memo with a bunch of recommendations, so very maybe narrowly tailored to what we would do in the written form. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so I can... \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, so what I can do is add the words written where it reflects recommendation to clarify that if you're all okay with it. \nSPEAKER_01:  right so that \nSPEAKER_01:  The intent is to capture the written recommendations that are being transmitted in a memo. And I can change some of the language in this to reflect memo written document, right, so that it's more clear. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we're building on a larger, I guess, wreck overall recommendation amongst all of us that would be one I'd like to put forward that we clarified that type of advocacy and what that entails. The second piece while we're on this page 13 section of recommendation is the city council. If we could also add some clarity that \nSPEAKER_08:  that what I guess what I'm trying to say is \nSPEAKER_08:  ensuring that what we present maintains in its original form. And that there is no edit to what we're presenting. So if there's dissent from other folks in the city that don't agree with our position and create their own documentation to say that, I think that's fine. But making sure if in and I don't know if it fits here if it needs to go somewhere else or at all for really ensuring that it's enshrined in our bylaws that once we've approved a document, it's not editable. \nSPEAKER_01:  So you don't have the discretion to stop the city manager. \nSPEAKER_08:  from editing our own document. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, so... \nSPEAKER_01:  But what we can do \nSPEAKER_01:  is what we've done here. So if... \nSPEAKER_01:  We can ask the city manager. The city manager can take that into consideration and ultimately it's their choice whether to agree to or not agree to. \nSPEAKER_01:  What this does is it automatically requests staff to one ask for your recommendations to be sent within 30 days of you making the recommendation and the it. \nSPEAKER_01:  If the city manager has a recommendation different than what you're asking, than what you've recommended, there's a request on the TransMiddle that says, please send it separate, preserve this document. Right? So the request is automatic with anything that you're going to be sending to City Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not sure how else to manage that, but I'm open to other ideas. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't want to speak for other departments. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that your \nSPEAKER_01:  your sentiments about the way that the facial recognition technology recommendation, transmitted have been heard. I don't know how that will manifest itself in the future though. So as an advisory body, and this is true, not just of you, but at any advisory body in the city, the city manager maintains that discretion to do their job as well. If they disagree with a recommendation that any of the bodies are making, regardless of who they are. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not specific to you. I think this is a way for there to be a written record that you're asking for your recommendation to be preserved. If you want me to clean up or clarify that language in the bullet point I.I. I can definitely do that too. \nSPEAKER_01:  if that's the will of the body. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, I think that might get us closer. Because I think, again, the concern I want to express, and I think that we're all, I think we've all talked about trying to solve is, even, again, if there's disagreement and there's full documentation of other people saying, absolutely not, we have a fully, completely different opinion that what we created at least maintains itself to as much of its true integrity as possible. \nSPEAKER_08:  as it moves forward, right? That, yeah, maybe there is a dissenting document, but that dissenting document stays intact as a five-page or a one-page or three sentences, and that even if there's other places to what that document says for, I think, any of our commissions, as this maybe becomes a living document for other commissions as well, I think is important to, again, why we're all here and trying to do that. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that was the only other thing I had there. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  Article 5 under bullet line regular meetings. \nSPEAKER_08:  I wanted to see if we could add something about the conversations we've been having around location requirements and technology requirements for our meetings. \nSPEAKER_08:  specific to us wanting to have phone and options for the general public and making sure that we are putting our best foot forward as a commission to try to have as Open of a meeting as possible Knowing that the city has limited facilities that accommodate that and making sure that that's that's kind of memorialized into the work of the commission \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think as we're doing this, maybe. \nSPEAKER_01:  what I can do. \nSPEAKER_01:  Just not commenting on what you just said is I can capture what all of the things are that you've said and then we can have a discussion about the things that you would like to have included in a motion. Does that work for the body? \nSPEAKER_01:  If everyone's going to have feedback similar to this, does that help? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, that we've maybe captured all Thursdays. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, we've been captured all first. \nSPEAKER_08:  perfect. And the last thing I had that I flagged as a question \nSPEAKER_08:  Sorry, really sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sorry, real sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you object. \nSPEAKER_01:  to anything that another commissioner is saying. Please queue up so that we can have that discussion and not travel down the paths together without \nSPEAKER_01:  thinking that you might be an agreement of some of these things. Okay, sorry, please continue. \nSPEAKER_08:  No, thank you. The last piece was page seven on the difference between standing committees and ad hoc committees, which I know we talked about quite a bit, but I'm just trying to clarify for myself. \nSPEAKER_08:  Because since we have declared a standing committee as being a brown act meeting, that obviously then has a huge impact on staff availability, city clerk availability, which quite frankly I think might render it ineffective. \nSPEAKER_08:  So as we're balancing this out, as we've kind of talked about these greater visions around what a standing committee could be versus the Adhoc committee, are we stuck with this definition of what some of that extended committee work would look like or is there another way to achieve that without going into this brown act space, which would ultimately probably prevent us from doing a lot of that work. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the definitions that are here. \nSPEAKER_01:  are the definitions of what these things are. \nSPEAKER_01:  I included it in here because I've sent a couple of memos to this commission. I know it's an ongoing sticking point for you. So to have it codified in your bylaws of what we're saying when we say these words, and that you don't always need a person like me to be in the seat, I think it's important. \nSPEAKER_01:  It does not obligate you to having standing committees, but if there's an opportunity in the future where there is capacity staff resources to do those things, these are the rules that the standing committee or the ad hoc committees would operate under. So you're not beholden to creating standing committees, but when you do, these are the rules that would apply to them. Does that help? \nSPEAKER_08:  That does, so I guess maybe my question is, or maybe this is a better framing of the question, is there some sort of third option in between those two that exists that could be built out in definition that is closer to it? Like, because again, I'm thinking that we do have some longstanding things, like things that are gonna take longer in turn to work through, which based on the definition would automatically advance them into the standing committee positioning. \nSPEAKER_01:  No. \nSPEAKER_08:  No, so. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  If you create an ad hoc to solve racism, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  That's probably not an ad hoc, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not going to be a short-term project. It's something that's going to be a long-term solution building recommendation, right? Were we automatically know, like, I know some of you smiled, right? Because you know in your hearts, that's not a short term. \nSPEAKER_01:  project. Writing a letter to the City Council, like the other agenda item, because you disagree with the Supreme Court decisions and you want the City to hold the Supreme Court accountable to the best of their ability. That's a shorter term project, right? So what we're hoping to do with some of your ideas is to break them into chunks that are actually adhawks, right? And not, we're not couching these ideas into adhawks to get around the Brown Act rules, the public deserves to participate in the process, right? So, \nSPEAKER_01:  The third option is that I can think of right now in this moment as the one that we're participating in right now. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think another avenue, but it would be a full meeting, would be more of like a study session type format. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  which study sessions are built with the intent of information gathering. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  collecting information not only from staff but from the public. \nSPEAKER_01:  and where the commission doesn't necessarily have to come to a decision, but it requires all of you to be here. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  In my time on this commission, I've tried and dug into the Brown Act to find creative solutions. Unfortunately, and unfortunately, right, the process is public on purpose. \nSPEAKER_06:  Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that creates \nSPEAKER_01:  challenges right to get business done especially with the commission of your size. So as long as your ad hoc are actually for a temporary purpose like for example my friends on the ethics commission they've been working on a recommendation regarding lobbying. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we're going on over a year. \nSPEAKER_01:  And they're actively working. They meet a couple times a month. It is a short-term project. Time isn't always, and we're almost done. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're rounding third, right? But so once they're done, they add hawk wool dissolve, right? Time is not necessarily a factor that prevents you like, oh, this has been going on too long. But if it's going on too long because the subject matters to broad, that's a different problem, right? Got it. And so being thoughtful about \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  and so \nSPEAKER_01:  what we're creating an ad hoc for and the specific mission of the ad hoc to get business done to bring it back to the full body. \nSPEAKER_08:  and not that fair. She's applauding. I'm not going to call my son-in-law. \nSPEAKER_08:  So then I think the only thing I would add then is maybe rather than try to create something else in here maybe just clarifying that because I think that explanation was great Understanding that like time is not the determinant of those two things Because that's that's where certainly where my mind was where like oh if we meet over a certain number of months Obviously that kicks it up. So maybe just that clarification would would satisfy that \nSPEAKER_08:  And all I had. Sorry, that was a lot. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Allen, thank you very much. Before I move on to Commissioner Luciares, I do have a clarifying question based on your recommendation. For study sessions, \nSPEAKER_06:  As written right now, it's not clear for us and maybe this is part of the recommendation. Could we turn any meeting on a monthly meeting into a study session, or do we have 30 sessions in between the official meetings, or is it both? Or do we decide? \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Again, it depends. So... \nSPEAKER_01:  You have partners with the Office of Equity. \nSPEAKER_01:  that have to be available for an additional meeting. There is coordination with the space of doing that. So, and by space, I mean facilitating a meeting that's accessible to the public. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  A couple things. Number one, you don't have to have a study session as a standalone item. It could be an item within your regular agenda. I just would recommend that if you are anticipating robust public comment, that you may be keep a light agenda. \nSPEAKER_01:  So you're not put in a position to lay items over and just being thoughtful about what that agenda looks like. If for some reason. \nSPEAKER_01:  You need to have a separate meeting that would require coordination of the clerk's office, TID, and your commission liaison and staff. It can be a separate meeting. There is some logistics that are involved with doing that. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as long as it is possible under the logistics confines you can have a separate meeting. There are additional considerations that go along with that if you're asking for that. And then if you are asking for that, I would just not a legal issue, but give staff space and time to get back to you on the possibility of what's possible. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for clarifying. Commissioner Lutaires. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great, thank you. Okay, my first question is on page two. Our article three under Quorum. \nSPEAKER_03:  Taylor, you've answered this for us before. So there's not a new question, but since it's here in our bylaws, I have to... \nSPEAKER_03:  Try again. \nSPEAKER_03:  So Quorum, as we know, it is based on the total number of members in our commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is that something that is codified in the city? \nSPEAKER_03:  charter or, you know, in the municipal code, or is that something that we can? \nSPEAKER_03:  have discretion over in our bylaws. \nSPEAKER_01:  two things. \nSPEAKER_01:  Not yet. \nSPEAKER_01:  but coming to a municode near you. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then the official position of Don McIntosh City Attorney is this is how Cora was measured. And other bodies have been prevented from holding meetings that are \nSPEAKER_01:  very time-sensitive and important. \nSPEAKER_01:  employment-related issues because they didn't have all the seats filled. So this is not even though it's here, it's not something that my office is open for debating about and something that's left up to the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this is another one that I put here so that \nSPEAKER_01:  We know we've had this discussion, but we're looking to have all the commissions held to the same standard. It's a different project that I'm working on. So we're looking to have things be more consistent across all of the bodies, but that is a lot of work to do it. So it's taking a little bit of time. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for answering my question again and good to know that this is something that is going to be hopefully standard across all the commissions. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, my next question, actually before I get to that, I wanted to make a comment about Commissioner Bats' recommendation around meetings, you know, like advertisement promotions. I did want to call to our Commission's attention that the Office of Equity does send out a newsletter that promotes our meetings. I'm not sure how often that goes out. So maybe you can clarify. Staff, how often does that go out? \nSPEAKER_03:  We tried it. \nSPEAKER_00:  the newsletter out at the beginning of each month, so prior to the meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so that's one place where, you know, the public can find us. Though I do know sometimes there's a lot of different promotional, you know, pieces in there. So sometimes our meeting could get buried. So it would be good. I know this might not be for our bylaws per se, but for us to figure out how we do do more outreach to community. And then on that same note, the Vets Commission actually does have their own Facebook page. It's a, like, a group page. That's the way that they've structured it. So I'm curious if anyone here knows how they were able to get that in place. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Veterans Commission. I will talk to their attorney and find out how they were able to do that. \nSPEAKER_03:  the Veterans Commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, because they've had it for quite a while. I think since when I was first implemented back when I was in... \nSPEAKER_03:  Cancel member Richardson's office. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so that commission doesn't have a full-time attorney on it also, so sometimes things like that happen because \nSPEAKER_01:  people don't ask, but I will look into it. \nSPEAKER_01:  and get back to you. Okay, well I hope they don't have to take it down. Ha ha ha. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  You \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  lol \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, well social media and promotions, I'll reach all of that. I think it's something we definitely need to maybe revisit as a commission, but I'm understanding it's probably not appropriate for our bylaws. Is that right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I think that that would be something. If what you're saying is \nSPEAKER_01:  You want the city to have more promotion of your meetings? That's a different ask than what we're trying to accomplish here. Got it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so then my and I have two more questions. Commissioner Allen, thankfully, he had the same questions as me. So on page five under article four, number four, term of officers. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  It says here that the officers are for one year, but I'm not clear if this limits how many terms the officers \nSPEAKER_01:  can be elected. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is a limit in the municode. I can add it here too. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  And can you clarify what is that limit? You cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. OK. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so that answers that. Well, I guess actually one question. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we can't serve more than two consecutive terms. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there flexibility though in the duration of that term? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  because it's codified in the municode. \nSPEAKER_03:  So they're all one year. So basically, it's two terms one year. Yes. OK. \nSPEAKER_03:  I thought that backwards. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. And then. \nSPEAKER_03:  The last question. Let me find it here. Apologies. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, you know what? \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, it was on the recommendations of City Council. So that actually concludes my questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, Commissioner Gutiores. Before I move on to Commissioner Bats, there is a question that had related to your prior, as well as love kind of hearing. I'm going to bring some new questions. I thought Vice Chair Cometin and I had all these questions covered in the month of the month. This is why we need these conversations. The bylaws currently has written say that the elections are in July. And maybe my memory is off, but I thought we were elected in June. So, \nSPEAKER_06:  I guess that's up for us to decide whether it's June or July. I'm wondering what if we have to go to the Russian Alpha or July versus June. \nSPEAKER_06:  because I think we were elected in June and I know it's the Bila Screenless HLI. \nSPEAKER_01:  So... \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Terms start in July. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so that's why it's July. If you so in theory. \nSPEAKER_01:  any new commissioners would be added in July. We're a little bit out of cycle with that. \nSPEAKER_01:  as of late just trying to fill vacant seats, but we're hoping to get, and by we, I mean, the Mayor's Office. \nSPEAKER_01:  as a backup dancer for the mayor's office. We're hoping to streamline this, right, so that we're not doing a ton of off-cycle appointments, but it is something that happens people are human and have things that come up. So if you wanna have it in June instead, that's fine too, that, that, \nSPEAKER_01:  change can be made. But my understanding is most of the commissions do July because it aligns with when new commissioners are being added to the body. \nSPEAKER_06:  understood so I think I would just ask commissioners now that we have that answer to think about that and within as these comments emerge chiming on that especially those commissioners who've been here a couple years whether the June has been working versus July now that we have that context. I move on to commissioner bets. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just wanted some clarification. You said the Office of Equity sends out a newsletter. Who does that go to? Because I actually don't even recall seeing that. \nSPEAKER_00:  and goes to any member who is subscribed to our newsletter. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Gillette. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. My question is on page three, number four advocacy. \nSPEAKER_05:  The very last line there or less sentence where it talks about identifying or stuff and what capacity you're speaking before city officials. What I think sample listed is I am here to discuss this issues, these issues as a resident of the city comment not as a commissioner of the EHRC. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm wondering if that second part after the comment is necessary for those who may not know your commissioner or may not care that your commissioner, depending on what subject matters being discussed. \nSPEAKER_01:  I see what you're saying. Would it help if it was clarifying? \nSPEAKER_01:  if you're advocating to city officials. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm just thinking if we're at a city council meeting and the subject is like last night the budget budget agenda item. So if we're talking if we're advocating for certain budgeting item on our own behalf as an individual, is it necessary for us to say I'm here not as a commissioner of the EHRC or could just say I'm so and so and I am you know speaking as the resident of the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, that's an option. It's an example. It's not you're not beholden to this. Okay. It was more provided as a means to \nSPEAKER_01:  clarify what's intended so you can refer to yourself as a resident. However, however you want to self identify, I know \nSPEAKER_01:  Council members. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm if you're talking to them and advocating all the time and you come before the Dias to give public comment They're going to know who you are It helps if you say I'm here, you know as a resident that works too. Yeah \nSPEAKER_05:  Q \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. And then I just have minor non-substantive. \nSPEAKER_05:  Aquamatical edits. I don't know how you want to receive those. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's not that many, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  I didn't know if you'd like me to go with those or just wait until we have the revised draft. \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, no, because I don't want to change more when we're done. Okay. You can lay it on me. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, they're really minor. Page three, number five, Commission liaison. Second line, commission is responsible for preparing the agenda. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then page four. \nSPEAKER_05:  under article 4, number 1. First line. \nSPEAKER_05:  Election of officers, two officers must be elected. Oh, boy. \nSPEAKER_05:  Very minor, very minor. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  And then page 7, section 6, ad hoc committee under subsection B appointment. Last line, members may not serve on more than I'm assuming one ad hoc committee at a time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mm-hmm. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  Page 9 actually it's a question number 6. No written documentation submitted to the commission after 12 p.m. on the scheduled meeting date may be considered. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm wondering, I know this is for us rather than the public. \nSPEAKER_05:  Where do we need to specify where those submissions are to go and who? \nSPEAKER_05:  if we need more detail from that line. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's handled through the agenda. Okay. And it's the clerk's office. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't see those things changing but in the event they do, it leaves it fluid so it would be public comment either submitted to the clerk's office or to Tony. \nSPEAKER_01:  further commission liaison. So we can make that clear for Kay. \nSPEAKER_05:  so we can make it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and then page 11. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  second paragraph, second full paragraph, first line. \nSPEAKER_05:  One, sorry. One page. Page 11, second full paragraph. First line. Once before the Commission discussion is limited to again, SuperMiner, the last motion on the floor. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then page 15. \nSPEAKER_05:  in the chart, third chart, third row from the bottom. \nSPEAKER_05:  Equity means all and to achieve this so we move A. \nSPEAKER_05:  See you then again. And removing A where it says equity means all into achieve this with center. \nSPEAKER_07:  See you then again. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  center. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. Thank you. That's it all. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Apologies. When you read a document too many times, your brain is that information exactly thing. So, I appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_05:  come on out and Monday, \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you commissioner Gillette. I have only seen that one typo so I appreciate you combing through these with your expertise and going through all that. So thank you. Thank you so much. It saves Taylor a bunch of time and saves a lot of us and Commissioner coming to my time so appreciate that. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a formal one, Commissioner Allen. I was thinking about onboarding. Is are the bylaws a space for procedures on onboarding for consistency, or is that better left for our policy handbook? \nSPEAKER_01:  What? \nSPEAKER_01:  What related to onboarding? Because onboarding's typically handled through the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what? \nSPEAKER_01:  outside of the city's process, would you like to have done by commission staff or by this commission? \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I understand the question. Okay, so what I'm thinking. \nSPEAKER_06:  And this could easily be a whole other conversation. So I don't want to kind of open up a kind of words here. But in terms of consistency, stake and standardization, and ensuring that commissioners go through a process where, I mean, I'm trying to, I mean, there was so much that I got to remember everything. But, you know, one thing that comes to mind, like for example, I know next month, we're going to get a training on Robert's Rules of Order. Right, so I would really appreciate that training coming in during the onboarding process for commissioners. I know it's so difficult to retain all that information. I'm still trying to learn everything. But I think it would really help with commissioners navigating the discussions and space because there are rules to follow. And I know a lot of us have amazing ideas to contribute, but sometimes because of the Robert's Rules of Order, it becomes difficult and navigating how to best present ideas without having on it. So that's just one example, just to kind of figure out, is this something that we codify when our bylaws or just kind of leave it in another space to ensure that folks are onboarded to the best of our rules abilities? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Funny that you should say something. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm actually working with the mayor's office and the clerk's office and HR. I am on the team to help improve the onboarding of commissioners. One of those things is Robert's Rules of Order. The other is motions and then a presentation on the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the Public Records Act. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm a one person machine. \nSPEAKER_01:  trying to crank out these presentations. They will be added to learn, which is a digital platform that you will all get access to. The goal is for you to be able to access those presentations at any time. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then I have also volunteered to do an in-person meeting for all commissioners at least once a year so that we could have a forum and presentation and in-person discussion. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that we're in pencil talking about. \nSPEAKER_01:  maybe September, maybe August, right after everybody in theory gets on boarded to catch all of the new and incoming commissioners at once until I was more seasoned commissioners if they have questions to ask them. The goal from that space will to be to create an FAQ of the questions that arise out of it that will be accessible to all of you. So these are the types of things that we're looking at building. You will also be required to do additional trainings from the clerk's office like on the city strategic plan. Strategic vision, the 2020, 2020, 2030 strategic vision. I believe a lot as office is also working on a fantastic presentation about equity. It's going to be amazing. So we're all contributing to streamline this process for commissioners so that it should over time improve. It's going to be transparent, quite a heavy lift to get this off the ground. We just finished the effort to allow for commissioners to volunteer on commissions to the extent possible to ensure that our undocumented residents are able to access service as well. So now that that effort is finished, we're turning towards education. So those things are coming. I'm hoping. \nSPEAKER_01:  Before the end of the year, at least the legal parts will be done. That may be highly optimistic. At least the Robert's rules and the motions presentation will be uploaded before the end of the year. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. So if I were to synthesize, I'm hearing, well, first of all, much appreciation for that work. Thank you, because I know it's a lot and long overdue. But to synthesize, I think for the purposes of the bylaws, and it probably wouldn't necessarily be a space to cut a fire. Yeah, so it's being handled. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so it's being handled. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  I very long-winded answer to your question. It's being handled outside of the bylaws. And I think it's something that's out of your control. It's another space where you can request it to happen, but there are other factors that play to making it happen. If in the future, for some reason, there's a problem where I'm hoping this doesn't happen, but I'm hoping this doesn't happen. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  You need an in person Robert's rules or brown act presentation. You can always ask me to do that and come back and give you an in person refresher. Or if we need to talk through the brown act, like I can I can always come and provide that to you as your attorney. You have that option to request that of of me. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  for some reason the online platform. \nSPEAKER_01:  is in providing what you need. I'm hoping that it will. But I can always come in. I know in person has different benefits, so I can always do that. I know that we just did a refresher, so that's always an option as well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Commissioner Gillette, do you have any remaining comments? Just want to touch base here. Okay. Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'll explain that in a later bit so I say follow the question now. So there's another admission to the patient. Yeah, that works out properly. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, are there any other commissioners with feedback on any of these agenda items before commissioner Allen provides follow-ups? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, I love it. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm just checking. \nSPEAKER_06:  As an educator, I always intentionally go slow. It feels like an eternity, but I just want to always check and that's going to be me consistently, always go slow. All right, so Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_08:  Awesome, thanks, Chair. \nSPEAKER_08:  So a couple of questions came up in the same thing in the conversation as things were happening. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  Actually a question for the city clerk on the topic of promotion. I know when we sign up for the city newsletters and things, like I sign up for the city council agendas to get set to me when they get published, is our commission agendas are those part of that like selection process where a member of the public could actually select our commission and get noticed when our agendas are published or is that like restricted to just the council meetings? \nSPEAKER_08:  Or maybe that's over here, I don't know where that goes. \nSPEAKER_00:  So what happens is the public can sign up and what we do is we send them. \nSPEAKER_00:  A notification. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Telling them. \nSPEAKER_00:  that the agendas are available to view online. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  It's not the actual agenda because the agenda is posted on a website or they can access but if they do sign up There's a means for them to sign up. There's something called LB link \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  and they receive an notification when we publish a genders. \nSPEAKER_08:  And it is our commission on that because I do that and I don't recall seeing it, but I certainly could have missed it. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know what I would have to check with the person that's responsible because this is fairly new. I'll definitely follow up to make sure that you're there. \nSPEAKER_08:  just for the body just thinking as we talk about promotion like that's a great way. Someone only has a sign up once they could sign up for everything and get notifications. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  in terms of the two term leadership question for the city attorney. \nSPEAKER_08:  As we move to a co-chair and chair slash vice chair role, so in this case we have a chair and a vice chair. Does that two term leadership, term limit exist? \nSPEAKER_08:  Like in both or they compatible. I think like we go from a vice chair and then the vice chair becomes a co-chair with a new person. Does that vice chair subject to the same? That's now their second term because they're in the second term of leadership or. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the way that the Muni Code is written is it's a broad term of officer. So however, officer takes shape. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  In this body, it doesn't necessarily make sense because we have support staff, but let's say you could have a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right. So those are all terms for officers, just as co-chair is. So if for one term, \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Let's say \nSPEAKER_01:  There's more of a collaborative approach of the commission in that term. First term is co-chairs. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Second term is \nSPEAKER_01:  Why is it president vice president? I'm on a board. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  putting it together or retreat my brain is in sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair and vice chair. That first term is co-chair is one. \nSPEAKER_01:  If there are vice chair in the second term, two terms, and you're done. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay \nSPEAKER_01:  Where you need to take a break for a term. You're not done forever. \nSPEAKER_08:  got it. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then in that. \nSPEAKER_08:  I guess co-chair structure. \nSPEAKER_08:  not that this is reflective of our team, but in the future, if there were co-chairs that disagreed on how to lead this commission. \nSPEAKER_08:  Do we have... \nSPEAKER_08:  It's some sort of conflict resolution process where \nSPEAKER_08:  If I get in a post-coach, here's where not an agreement on things or \nSPEAKER_08:  one was overtaking the other and running thing. Like, I'm just wondering if we have to build out that in here or is that another commission and another city attorney's problem? \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's up to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  That can be a future EHRC problem to address it when it happens. We can take a pause here with the bylaws and \nSPEAKER_01:  I would need some help on what you would want for conflict resolution. That's, like I have ideas, but it's a little bit outside my legal expertise and I don't want to speak for you on how you expect your members per se to perform and behave. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you have ID, I know the chair had mentioned something like that. When we were going back and forth about this, so you can also adapt these. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, for now, and then have a discussion at a later date, and we can amend and restate your bylaws to include conflict resolution. You have a little bit of time because we're currently in a chair vice chair structure. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  It's something that can be addressed at a future meeting if you would like. It's really up to your what the body wants to do on that one. And if you have concerns about \nSPEAKER_01:  who's surfing each other in a co-chair structure, you know. It's something that definitely can be added to the Bible. \nSPEAKER_08:  that certainly not a recommendation that I want to make tonight I think definitely that open and have that conversation when that happens. That my last one was on the ad hoc committee of being limited to just one ad hoc committee. Is that in and of itself a requirement under the Brown Act or is that something that we have flexibility on? \nSPEAKER_01:  So we generally don't recommend Commissioner serving on multiple ad hawks because it starts to create problems under the brown act because now you have to keep track of how many people that you're not supposed to be talking to. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you're only working on one thing at a time \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  It prevents that issue from moving forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's not what I'm interested in. It prevents the Brown Act from being a problem, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  And I know that that is generally the position of my office as we don't recommend. I know council has a lot of standing committee in \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  It creates a lot of problems about. There's a lot of emails behind the scenes about who they can talk to about what. \nSPEAKER_01:  And it's a lot of times it shakes out to not a lot of people. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Got it. And so I guess my comment on that would be under this structure that would limit us to only three subcommittees Essentially, right because of the there's 15 of us if there can't be more than like four I think is what I read I'm not great at math, so don't quote me out there. Yeah \nSPEAKER_01:  No, yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  But I mean that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm gonna turn it for that exact reason, sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I, I, I, I, and again, I guess it's, it might be a future problem, but thinking through \nSPEAKER_08:  as we're restructuring this committee and the kind of the vision that we've set forward. \nSPEAKER_08:  There's the potential to have a decent number of ad hoc committee work that may be necessary. And so is there a functional way within the bylaws to maybe take that to two or not put that limitation on but put more of a suggestion so that we're not. \nSPEAKER_08:  like limited in terms of the words on the piece of paper, but you know it's more of a judgment call or consultation with the attorney or something to that effect that doesn't quite limit us so specifically. \nSPEAKER_01:  So it doesn't have, I think, I'm trying to find the page. \nSPEAKER_08:  Oh, sorry. That's OK. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay page seven \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's four or fewer. \nSPEAKER_01:  Which means you could have ad hocs of three or two people if you wanted to. And I think you're at 15. So in theory, you could have seven ad hocs. \nSPEAKER_01:  If you drop down to two people on an ad hoc, so if you increase it to four, I think we get closer to two and a half ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  or maybe right because for me. \nSPEAKER_08:  So then maybe one of those numbers needs to come out so that we don't have both. Because I'm looking specifically at page 7 sub B that is the appointment portion. \nSPEAKER_08:  so that the commission may appoint four or fewer and then to the edit that was made earlier of adding and making sure it's clear that members may not serve on more than one at Hock at a time. \nSPEAKER_08:  because I think we've typically gone with four. \nSPEAKER_08:  that's the way you're for we've typically taken the max. \nSPEAKER_01: \u00f6tti U \nSPEAKER_01:  So what you're asking for. \nSPEAKER_01:  is an exception. \nSPEAKER_01:  unless after consultation basically with my office that you can move forward with another one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  something that that effect yeah so I guess my yeah the one I would say that maybe to pull out is the explicit set of section that says members may not serve on more than one and maybe turn that into a \nSPEAKER_08:  recommendation but consultation type of thing. \nSPEAKER_08:  Not to create more work for you either, but... \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. This document is for you. It's not for me. \nSPEAKER_08:  That will help. And thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  That gives us that flexibility to \nSPEAKER_08:  You know, again, if we do end up with a lot of work and it is necessary for somebody to be on to, that we have that ability. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that's all I had, Chair. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you Commissioner Allen gave us a lot to think about here too. I'll work in a move on the Commissioner with the address and unless there are other commissioners I'm going to go ahead and give closing comment for this. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Thank you, Dennis. Chair, I just want to revisit the onboarding conversation quickly. So the onboarding that was referenced was the type of training that the City Attorney's Office would provide like Robert's Rules and Brown Act, etc. There's actually I think a different kind of onboarding that I was thinking about and it was something that Vice Chair Erickson and I used to do informally that I think could be codified in the bylaws is actually more of an onboarding to this commission in particular like including like the history of the commission sharing our roadmap, presenting our bylaws, sharing what advocacy looks like in our commission, you know, going over maybe the racial reconciliation report since that's codified in our ordinance amendment and our roadmap, things like that. So I think if there is an onboarding conversation to be had in the bylaws, I would recognize and recommend that it's specific to those kinds of things that our, you know, to orient them to our commission rather than being a commissioner in general. So just wanted to draw that distinction because it is something that's been missing and like I said, Vice Chair Erickson, I would do it informally as new commissioners would come onboard but it wasn't always universal, right? We didn't have this like standardized way. We would do it, we would usually go to coffee and kind of, you know, download all the things on the new commissioner. So just a suggestion. \nSPEAKER_06:  uh... terny anderson any comment on that i mean it could be that's a big \nSPEAKER_01:  That's something that you could add. I just need clarification. So number one. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm assuming that that responsibility would be automatically put on the chair vice chair slash co-chairs. \nSPEAKER_01:  right? Or would there... \nSPEAKER_03:  a commissioner has story in. \nSPEAKER_01:  In theory, you could have the commission could agree on the like. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner welcome committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner if it's not the chair and vice chair or co-chairs so I think that's something to think about and then \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I captured the idea. It sounds like the history of the commission, the bylaws. I feel like there was a third thing that I may have missed. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  The way we advocate for things, I mean I know that part of that is in the viola as mentioned advocacy but just more like the history of the context setting. \nSPEAKER_03:  that making them familiar with the roadmap. \nSPEAKER_03:  like it's a more of an orientation to the AHRC in particular. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's something that you can add to your bylaws if that's what you want to do. I think you have to think about and agree on who is the person that bears that responsibility on this commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, and I think historically it's always been the chair or the chair and vice chair as a partnership. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. I think what we can do with that recommendation is once we get the draft between now and the next meeting, Vice Chair coming to and I can take a look and recommend some language that captures. Welcome Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez recommended. So I appreciate that to round out this discussion. I'm trying to do my best to predict and it's hard to predict the future here, but a month from now and an ideal situation once we have the new draft with all these fantastic recommendations is review of one last time and hopefully any any if any changes. There would be minor type of instances instead of substantive changes. However, since I cannot and no one can predict the future in the event that there are substantive changes in terms of content. My last remaining questions. So we're all aware from Taylor Anderson here. In the event a commissioner does make another substantive change. Would we be able to in that same meeting create that language and then vote type of that we vote in that that pilots is supposed to wait waiting yet another month for that. \nSPEAKER_01:  For a substantive change, no. If I you catch more of my embarrassing typos, those can be made on the floor, but substantive changes typically cannot be adopted on the floor. It requires the draft to come back. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I appreciate that clarification as we try to plan and navigate the final approval of the bylaws. I thank you for this robust discussion. That prediction I did get correct. It did lead to a very robust discussion. I'm actually very excited about this because I think government works best when we codify the flow, what we do. So the public knows what we do, so we know what we do. And we can rely on the language in this document here when there are moments of clarity. And there have been many in the past and there will probably be moments in the future. And we now have this document hopefully by next month to help guide us forward. So thank you, thank you very much. And with that said, I'm going to refer now to do we need a proper proper vote for. Yes. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what I'm going to do is we're going to all you this one. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will throw the ball up. I just need someone to put in the basket for us. So the motion would be to request the city attorney to make \nSPEAKER_01:  The changes as agreed upon by the commission to the bylaws and return at the next meeting for the sake of your understanding of what you're voting on. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to read to you the things that I have captured to make sure that we are all in agreement about the changes that I am coming back with. The typos that were read into the record will be corrected. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  to clarify on page 13 when we're talking about sending recommendations to the council, clarify that it's written documents and memorandums that we're talking about in that section. \nSPEAKER_01:  on page 8. \nSPEAKER_01:  Adding the importance of the accessibility both from a technological standpoint and a physical location standpoint of the meetings for the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  on page 7. \nSPEAKER_01:  Two changes, number one, time is not determinative of how long an ad hoc can be in place. And then, \nSPEAKER_01:  changing the language to allow consultation with the city attorney and removing language where it's limited to one ad hoc at a time. \nSPEAKER_01:  Adding on page five, the commissioners cannot serve more than two terms as officers and that is in the municipal code. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then we're adding a section about onboarding. \nSPEAKER_01:  that is the will of the commission to have the history, context, bylaws, and road map downloaded onto new commissioners when they're onboarded. The only thing that I'm not clear on is how we're moving forward with the social media aspect. Are we putting a pin in that idea and coming back to it? It's something that needs to be explored separately. I'm seeing knots here. So then that would not be something that you're voting on this evening. \nSPEAKER_07:  Alright so my name is \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, so I'm going to move over to Commissioner Allen who's making the motion. Did you capture all that I'm getting? So I have Commissioner Allen making the motion and I have a second from Commissioner Lisette. Flores. So I'm going to refer now to the clerk for the vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  Did you want to call for public commenters? \nSPEAKER_06:  do we have any members of the public in person? \nSPEAKER_06:  Do you have any members online? \nSPEAKER_00:  No public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. So now we can move over to the vote. Thank you."

Can we have the next agenda item? \nSPEAKER_01:  Item 3 is a recommendation to discuss the chair and vice chair draft letter from the equity and human relations commission to the City Council on Students for Fair Admissions Inc. Versus President and Fellows of Harvard College. \nSPEAKER_03:  Given our time constraints, I think this may work out. I actually came here with a recommendation on this one too. Actually move, I guess the correct bourbage if you correct me, the attorney could have me in here with me too. We're seeing this particular agenda item given that we're having a discussion on the on the bylaws. We're having a process now in place for future recommendations. And given that this occurred back in June, I think it's best to move forward without this particular agenda. I don't know if that is something we can, unless there's a difference of thought here. We go in. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I'm gonna show you a couple. \nSPEAKER_00:  I do agree that we should rest in that, but I was wondering. And again, my first meeting, so forgive the way I might broke it. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  But \nSPEAKER_00:  the issue doesn't go away. So are we empowered to \nSPEAKER_00:  two \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  give guidance or best practices. \nSPEAKER_00:  The ruling is about admissions, but \nSPEAKER_00:  people in other cities and different universities are doing different things to support. \nSPEAKER_00:  recruiting. \nSPEAKER_00:  which is perfectly legal. \nSPEAKER_00:  and other doing things like going to high schools and going to churches and having summer enrichment programs to help increase the pool of applicants that are being affected. So I don't know if that's something that. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's a big idea for you know, but how? \nSPEAKER_00:  that would work with this group or if that's something we could consider in the future. \nSPEAKER_03:  I like how you think commissioner. So you definitely, I see why you're part of this commission and you're speaking my language and the educational world. We as a body definitely make recommendations in general. The spirit of this, originally the intent behind this commission was given the decisions back in June. Much of the country was very upset and we were trying to mobilize. But when we meet once a month, it became difficult to kind of figure it out. So I, you know, it was my first month and I was trying to figure out how to use this particular space to create some advocacy behind it. Now that I'm two, three months in, two, three months in, seeing how this actually works in practice. I'm like, well, now it's in the bylaws. And then we can maybe create out how committees and maybe have some advocacy work like that. And so that's where it comes in. But thank you for your not only recommendation but the spirit of his commission. The trends in your comments, I appreciate that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, any other? Once we move forward, any public comment? \nSPEAKER_01:  No public comment here. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  So do we need a proper motion to then move forward or we're okay? \nSPEAKER_02:  You can take a motion to \nSPEAKER_02:  You don't need a motion to move forward, but if you'd like to take a motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want to be clear. Are we tabling meaning we're not going to talk about this again or are we laying it over to the next meeting? \nSPEAKER_03:  and the former. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so if we're tabling it, I think that the commission should vote on it. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, we're not table. I'm sorry. Let me pause. Is there so I think meaning that we're striking it from the issue doesn't go away. I want to recognize but the actual recommendation. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that's the part that we're not going to necessarily. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  You can table it and pick it up at any time. It doesn't mean that you have to pick it up next time. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Are you saying that you want this to come back in a different format? \nSPEAKER_03:  I think removal will be fine and then we can kind of figure out how to best frame it in a way. If we want to bring it up in some way in terms of the content behind it, but I think removal is probably the best course of action. \nSPEAKER_03:  because of the specificity of it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  I understand. Okay, so then we're not going to hear this item. It will come back in a different form at another time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's vote on that to make sure the commission's an agreement that that's how they want to handle it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So you'll need a motion in a second. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can get a motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Flores and Commissioner Coveington seconds it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can have a clerk move forward with the vote. \nSPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. We have two other agenda."

So we agreed in May that we would create an ad hoc around reentry. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we made that promise publicly. We voted on it. Our partners have been asking about it. So I did, they were listening in at the last meeting and reminded me that at our last meeting, we did say that at this meeting, we would \nSPEAKER_05:  develop that ad hoc, like actually choose the members for that ad hoc. We decided not to do it at the last meeting because it was a special meeting and we were missing quite a few members. So just wanted to add that clarity in that context. If we do need to push it back another month, of course, we can communicate that to our partners. But I did want to make sure that that was said here for everyone. So we're on the same page. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the only thing I would say is that you... \nSPEAKER_04:  It's fine if you move forward on it and that's what you agree on. \nSPEAKER_04:  You also voted on what your priorities are, I think the last meeting. And so I would just ask you to check in with your own plan that you've created and how reentry fits into the priorities that you've adopted. So if you make the ad hoc now, it doesn't mean that you can't make other ad hocs, but it means that reentry gets prioritized either \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not sure where reentry fits into the plan that you adopted in the last meeting. I just would ask you to think about that because you may be adding an additional \nSPEAKER_04:  task on top of what you agreed to last time. Does that make sense? I believe it fits under the recognition and fund not mistaken. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  If I'm not mistaken. \nSPEAKER_04:  So just something to be thoughtful on, like you all agreed on the plan that you've adopted. And so checking in with that idea as you move forward and creating ad hoc. It's not to say that you can't do it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just putting that reminder out there for you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Goethe RSA appreciate the context from the reminder and that actually allowed me to remember two things. One that it did fit with the racial reconciliation framework point from the two-year roadmap. And two, if memory serves correctly, one of the other reasons we'd be able to do for this meeting is I think the Commissioner who made the motion was Commissioner Allen if I'm mistaken. And so we wanted to wait in the event, no pressure in the event, that Commissioner Allen wanted to be part of that ad hoc committee because that memory, thanks to your comment, the criteria just came back. So I mean, I know we're pretty much the world-renowned one here. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, if we can maybe take these last two minutes and just table the last agenda item. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. So we have a first from the Eddas and a second from Commissioner Holland to make this ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can we? \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we take public comment for the record, chair? Who are the members? \nSPEAKER_01:  So... \nSPEAKER_01:  point of clarification. Before when we make that, I committee, we need to have all of the members already decided or could we have that hot? It's already established and then add members. \nSPEAKER_01:  for procedure safety so we're clear. And I'm also asking because I want to be very mindful of the clock care. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  In theory, you can create the ad hoc, but it's not created until you put people on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I would encourage you to at least put a couple members on it and if you need to add more members in the future. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then I think, I think \nSPEAKER_04:  What would be better? \nSPEAKER_04:  You can create that hug here, but there needs to be more of a purpose about. \nSPEAKER_04:  what the ad hoc is making a recommendation about. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right? So if you can clarify that in the motion, that's fine. But what is the work of the ad hoc? Because if we just say reentry, then we're talking about a standing committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  to mention it with the address. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, so we actually made... \nSPEAKER_05:  We voted on a recommendation in May and specified the purpose. So I don't have that in front of me, but that's already been done. So is that... \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, like can we reference following what we have already voted on and specified in the main meeting? \nSPEAKER_05:  because there were three main... \nSPEAKER_05:  points around like three elements to the reentry conversation, which is why we wanted to make it an ad hoc instead of just write a letter because it was a little robust, but there were three main elements. I just don't have those off the top of my head. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, so for the record. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do you receive and file the presentation from Sharin? \nSPEAKER_04:  and then \nSPEAKER_04:  Create an ad hoc committee with the limited purpose of creating recommendation to the City Council related to reducing recidivism in the City of Long Beach. And as part of the ad hoc committee duties create a letter with those recommendations that will return to the Equity and Human Relations Commission for approval. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so in those three elements I'm referring to, we're in where the recommendations and shurines presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  So does that still stand? That's great. \nSPEAKER_05:  So does that still stand? That's great. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's what we needed to create. So today we're just adding members then. \nSPEAKER_05:  So today we're just \nSPEAKER_04:  Today you're creating it and adding members to it. \nSPEAKER_01:  And since it's so clear in terms of the purpose of that ad hoc, we can just, I think the best thing to do is if there are immediate members, we can just have this done. And if they're not, then we're going to have to table it. Are there any interested members of the Commissioner for the Sad Hoc Committee? \nSPEAKER_01:  So I have Commissioner Allen, Commissioner of the address, looking to my right. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  and could we add members we can start with two and maybe add some if there's interest at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, we'll just need to create. \nSPEAKER_04:  It can be addressed in this item in the next agenda. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and I think it goes without saying but just in case for the record the sense of urgency is because we did this back in May We want to make sure that we follow through on what the public asked of us and I appreciate You know it's the extra time just to make this happen for for the public So we have the motion on the floor. We have two members and On mess there's other another procedure to take take let me know but I've been referred to the clerk for the vote \nSPEAKER_03:  You have one more person, cute it. \nSPEAKER_01:  one more person, Q&A. \nSPEAKER_03: arlion deux \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. Commissioner Covington. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. I had a clarifying question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Today we're only speaking on the anti-racidivism at Hawk and then we're going to table this agenda item. \nSPEAKER_00:  to next week so we can talk about the other four priorities in our roadmap. \nSPEAKER_00:  to create adhongs for those as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, we're just doing this at Hocka Midi as opposed to the list. It's on there. \nSPEAKER_04:  So not tabling, this will just be a recurring item on your agenda. Table means like, we're going to take a pause and we're going to come back to it at another time. \nSPEAKER_04:  What we're doing today, or what you're doing today, is voting to form the ad hoc for reentry with the limited purpose that we read into the record. And then it sounds like for the sake of time. \nSPEAKER_04:  at the next meeting, you can talk about how you want to move forward. I think that we should maybe have an agenda item to talk through that, just so that the public is aware. \nSPEAKER_04:  of exactly what the scope is of what we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Clinton. Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much. And on the subject of time, I just wanted to remind us that it is now 833. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you.
