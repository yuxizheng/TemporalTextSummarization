        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  Ocean Carries. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Item number two. \nSPEAKER_03:  Item number two is a recommendation to receive and file an overview of the measure US funded proposals in the proposed budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  Turn this over to staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Great, thank you. Today we have Theresa Chandler, WD City Manager, and Kelly Collapy, our Director of Health and Human Services that will provide this presentation on Measure US. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_00:  Honorable members of the Budget Oursite Committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  Kelly, Calipian I are here to provide a brief presentation of the city team's proposed spending priorities for the measure US oil barrel production tax. This proposal is consistent with the spending priorities resolution approved by the city council last September 15, 2020. \nSPEAKER_00:  First we'd like to set some context for measure US. It was a ballot initiative that was approved by a majority of Long Beach voters on November 3, 2020. It increased the rate of the city's general purpose, oil barrel production tax from $0.15 per barrel to a maximum of $0.30 per barrel. These funds are subject to annual adjustments for inflation or deflation depending on the tax revenue amounts that are coming in. \nSPEAKER_00:  fiscal year 22 projected revenues from the measure US tax are estimated at 1.33 million and are expected to decline 8 to 10 percent per year. \nSPEAKER_00:  Although Measure US is a general purpose tax to fund service city services on September 15th, City Council adopted a resolution expressing its intent to prioritize spending of the funds. Consistent with City Council's policy direction, this budget proposes the allocation and support of children and new services and programs. \nSPEAKER_00:  Community Health and Wellbeing and Climate Change and Environment Initiatives. The ballot language listed the intent to invest in these areas. The Council called on City staff to create and expand early childhood education, youth programming and youth equity opportunities, implement youth-focused strategic plans and fund youth job training opportunities. \nSPEAKER_00:  to provide funding for community health and well-being programs and services, trauma-based approaches to community needs, violence prevention services, address health equity and health disparities in promised populations, and implement health-focused strategic plans. \nSPEAKER_00:  And finally, to provide funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, educate and inform the public of the consequences of climate change, implement the city's climate action and adaptation plan, and other environmental strategic plans and promote air and water quality. \nSPEAKER_00:  Looking back briefly to where this all began, the Invest in Youth Campaign was led by youth through Commi Girls Inaction and other community partners. They conducted a survey of over 750 Long Beach residents in partnership with the Advancement Project and Cal State Long Beach, and found that seven out of 10 residents support an increase of public funds for youth programs and 80% of those surveyed believe that the best way to make our community's safer is to invest in community-based youth development programming. \nSPEAKER_00:  They continue to seek in partnership with the city, enhanced sustainable funding focused on opportunities to help youth have successful lives. The Council directed City staff to create a youth fund as part of Measure US to ensure increased opportunity for youth in our city. \nSPEAKER_00:  The departments who were most aligned with the areas outlined in the measure US focused areas, health, parks, libraries, office of sustainability and equity, met together to discuss how we could collaborate to address core needs in the community. Existing strategic plans that have been informed by significant community feedback were used as the guiding post for the discussions. These plans include the youth and emerging adults, excuse me, youth and emerging adults strategic plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  racial equity and reconciliation. \nSPEAKER_00:  Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  Health and Human Services Strategic Plan, Early Childhood Education Strategic Plan, Older Adult Strategic Plan, \nSPEAKER_00:  and the Park Racken Marine Strategic Plan that was in draft form at that time. \nSPEAKER_00:  The conversations focused on new development and opportunity, youth workforce development, climate and sustainability and public health. \nSPEAKER_00:  They also focused on how youth development, workforce, equity and sustainability could be integrated into a number of the different options. You'll see youth development and workforce woven into many of the proposed programs. So Kelly is going to provide some more detail about what we are proposing. \nSPEAKER_02:  the day. \nSPEAKER_05:  So diving a bit deeper into the category, the budget includes a total of 917,636 for youth fund. This provides a variety of youth services and programs. Youth fund is a designation of Measure US funding as opposed to a standalone financial fund but creates significant investment in youth informed by the earlier mentioned strategic plans. \nSPEAKER_05:  We propose approximately 216,000 one-time funding into health department for direct grants to community-based organizations for youth development. \nSPEAKER_05:  337,000 to fund the Youth Ambassador Program and Parks Recreation and Marine. \nSPEAKER_05:  125,000 to support STEAM, which is science technology, engineering arts and mathematics in the library. And 49,000 for staff to support a library department in mental health program and services to youth between the ages of 13 and 18. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's 25,000 for one time funding in the health department to support an annual Long Beach Youth Summit and 165,000 to fund communication efforts, data management and youth grant support in the Health and Human Services Department. \nSPEAKER_05:  These next slides tell you a little bit more about it. The 216,000 one-time funding in the health department is the community-based organizations for youth development opportunities. We'd like to focus on peer navigators to support linkages to services for our youth, violence prevention programming, and other priorities. The youth ambassador program is a parks recreation and marine that would support up to 20 part-time positions for local youth and training them in best practice for landscape, park maintenance, and customer service. There will be new youth identified every year through the city's workforce development to attract interest and recruit new youth into the final quarter of each fiscal year. LW Youth would be identified through the team program. \nSPEAKER_05:  The Steam Program and the Library will allow the Library to build a hub or a lead organization to assemble local Steam experts together to do Steam workshops and summer Steam institutes for middle and high school students. The short term goal of the Steam ecosystem is to develop communities capacity to create and sustain high quality, engaging communities. \nSPEAKER_05:  The libraries are seeing an increase in mental health challenges and trauma among youth. They seek to implement mental health programming and services to youth between the ages of 13 to 18. The use for teacher plan also calls for a youth summit and per city council ordinance. The commission on youth families in youth is required to host an annual forum. So the Office of Youth Development will partner with the commission to host an annual Long Beach Youth Festival. This event will bring together youth service networks, city departments, the school district, and residents to learn about youth programming and youth engagement efforts undertaken throughout the city. These funds will be utilized to support this effort. \nSPEAKER_05:  Finally, the US Development Office, the Office of Youth Development requires certain roles to be successful that we're not funded under the Racial Equity and Reconciliation Funding and will not likely be supported by grants. These roles would enhance communication around the impact of measure U.S. funding in the community, write grants and work to increase funding for youth development and develop data collection and reporting tools to ensure we measure and report progress. The data manager role is outlined in the youth and emergency youth and emerging adult strategic plan, which calls for the development of data sharing and reporting infrastructure to capture the plan's impact as well as the development of the youth data dashboard. \nSPEAKER_05:  In community health, the budget is about $154,000. 95,000 of this would be for the Healthy Aging Center coordinator. It would be for that one half FTE of that position. The other half is funded through the homeless services funding. And approximately 59,000 for staff support in the Office of Equity to support racial equity. \nSPEAKER_05:  Health Department is committed to ongoing planning and support for older adults in our city and supporting intergenerational approaches for learning and growing. Your older adult's strategic plan calls for healthy aging center and for increased focus and sustainability for older adults in the city. The youth and emerging adult's strategic plan also calls for intergenerational approaches. Currently, the health department is funding for one-half FTE, as mentioned before. Through measure of US funds, we would be able to align funding to sustain a full-time coordinator, which would increase alignment and strengthen the opportunities for older adults in our city. \nSPEAKER_05:  The racial equity and reconciliation report calls for exploring and increasing investments and community-based violence prevention, intervention efforts, and strengthening these systems in Long Beach. We have a unique opportunity with measure U.S. investments in the youth fund to attach to the focus on utilizing an equity lens as a foundation for investments. \nSPEAKER_05:  And finally, we have climate change in the environment. The budget calls for a total of about 243,000 to support the Climate Action Adaptation Plan, Implementation Program, and other efforts around climate change. You'll see here that the youth workforce opportunities are integrated into this area through the fieldwork program and community-based opportunities. Proposed funding includes 80,000 to implement and lead the Green Jobs Field Program, 120,000 for one time to support youth worker trainees, 18,000 to fund community-based organization microgrants, and finally 25,000 one-time funding to support the development of an electric law and equipment program. \nSPEAKER_05:  Climate adaptation plan called for expanded neighborhood tree planting, urban agriculture program, and urban native stewardship training throughout the city. The funding aligned with this program provides for a field supervisor for this program. \nSPEAKER_05:  The Green Jobs Fieldwork Program supports youth worker trainees to perform fieldwork for expanded neighborhood tree planting, urban agriculture support, and urban nature stewardship training led by a program specialist and its inability coordinator. \nSPEAKER_05:  Funding will also support micro grants to community-based organizations to find community gardens, farms and teaching gardens. Funding can be used for tools as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the funding for the electronic law and the electric law and equipment program will cover one time support for a management assistant rotation to design the program. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the proposed measure US programs are tightly connected to goals already established in the city that were unfunded or underfunded. Measure US allows us to more deeply invest in youth development and workforce opportunity, begin to invest in sustainability programming, and provide funding for the unfunded portion of the Health Aging Center Program Coordinator to support older adults in our city. \nSPEAKER_00:  If we can emphasize anything from this presentation, it is that we are excited about the possibility to establish an infrastructure that allows growth and opportunity. \nSPEAKER_00:  to launch us into the future. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this concludes our presentation and we thank you for your time and consideration. Representation from the Health Department, Parks, Library, the Office of Sustainability are here to respond to questions if needed. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And thank you so much for that report. I'd like to first give my colleague the first opportunity to ask questions, Council Member Price. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you chair. So thank you for that presentation. I do have a couple of questions. For the proposals here that include Operation Add a City Facility, have we determined what city facilities will be used? \nSPEAKER_05:  We have not said there so there would be at various libraries if libraries here. I don't know if they have determined which facilities. They would be located out but so there would be steam program and then there would also be at various parks, the parks and besserts but I don't have a list of where they would be at this time. \nSPEAKER_09:  and mental health, correct? \nSPEAKER_05:  Now I have the libraries as well, yes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, okay, so are we providing transportation? Because I know that when we were talking about the Belmont pool, for example, there was a concern about how we get people to the pool. Are we going to be able to transport youth throughout the city of Long Beach to these facilities for the programs? \nSPEAKER_05:  At this time, it's not written into the budget. The transportation really is much more staffing at those locations. The divide is something that we could look at in terms of some of our other funding to be able to align those supports. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think an alternative to that if we don't have money for transportation might be spreading the facilities out throughout the city so that we're offering for example mental health throughout the city as opposed to just one area. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  because I'm not sure how you take a pull for where the need is on that. \nSPEAKER_09:  but I think that might be a good way to. \nSPEAKER_09:  In terms of the electric lawn program, can you tell me a little bit more about what's envisioned for that? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  You went from right here. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hi, I'm Kristen Payne, I'm the Sustainability and Lists for the Office of Sustainability. The Electric Law and More Equipment Program would \nSPEAKER_01:  be for the one time support of a management assistant to do the research around developing a program in which we would take small emitters like your \nSPEAKER_01:  your blue, head trimmer type, things, air blowers, and turn those gas powered appliances into an electric alternative, that is. \nSPEAKER_01:  both quieter and have less emissions. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, so this money would be to develop to hire somebody to help develop. \nSPEAKER_09:  a future program. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, correct with the management assistant rotation. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  All right, that's really good because leaf blowers are a major issue in my district because of the pollution and the noise and the trash. And so that's an item that I brought to council several years ago and the discussion was that from an equity standpoint we wouldn't be able to impose any sort of. \nSPEAKER_09:  Regulations requiring electric operated leafflowers because it might cost some people out of their profession and we don't want to do that. So is it envisioned that a program would involve some sort of grant funding? \nSPEAKER_09:  to individual land scapers to be able to switch out their equipment. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, the management assistant will be directed to look at the issue from multiple lenses. So equity is definitely going to be a big piece of that and making sure that business owners are able to afford the program is going to be an important consideration. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, all right. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then the final question I had, and I guess I think it goes back to Teresa and Kelly, unless there's someone here from Parks, what's the difference between the youth ambassador program and the green jobs field work program? Because looking at the descriptions, they seem like they might be some overlap. \nSPEAKER_05:  These ambassador programs are really specific to parks and parks, the work there. Similar to previous programs that we've had in terms of these ambassadors. And then if you'd like to speak about the green, the green jobs program, that would be helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so the Green Jobs program will actually be similar to a program that the Office of the Sustainability runs currently. So it will be youth workers, it is just expanding it. Youth workers focusing mostly on tree planting throughout the city. And the added piece with this with other full-time equivalent fell be added. The program specialist, these youth workers will also be focusing on urban agriculture initiatives in the city. So providing capacity to community gardens and those sort of programs. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, so do we envision that the Green Jobs field program will be run out of the sustainability department and the youth ambassador will be through parks and rats. \nSPEAKER_09:  That is correct. That is correct. That is correct. Perfect. Okay. Thank you for that. The only other thing that a comment that I would make is, you know, I know when there was initial polling done on Measure US, at least it was reported in the paper, what came back was that voters really wanted to see some money put towards climate action and that was far more of a priority. I think than some of the other priorities that were put forth in the polling. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so I realized that this is the first year of the budget, but I think to be true to the intent and the wish of the voters, we should really be \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  focused a lot on climate change and what we can do in that area since that that seemed to \nSPEAKER_09:  the indicated at least in the news articles that I read as a priority for the community and so things like climate change, very expensive to make a dent in clearly. But as we move forward, things like infrastructure projects that might help with some of the sea level rise issues and the climate change issues that we're saying I think would be very much supported by me and of course the residents that I represent for whom that was a major priority in voting in favor of this particular measure. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you for those comments. I'll just add a couple of questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  It's great to see so much new funding going toward youth programming and services specific to our youth. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  When I look at the children and youth services fund, \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a couple of questions just related to \nSPEAKER_04:  And what went into developing the... \nSPEAKER_04:  The proposed allocation, or was there a methodology, what was the consideration? \nSPEAKER_06:  be talking to the youth fund overall or more so to each of the categories. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm well looking at the children and youth services. And fine. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I guess my question is, within that category or overall the fact that it has $900,000 attached to it. \nSPEAKER_04:  But we understand $917,000. But so. \nSPEAKER_05:  How did we decide inside? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, how did you decide how much goes to which category? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So essentially we sat down with our partners and looked at all of the different spaces in the youth plan and other plans as well that were earlier discussed. And we started to pull from each, like, what are key programs that can be offered to our youth that align within those different plans? And so while we didn't start out with the conversation about parks you get that much and libraries that much, it was more about what are the key things that we're trying to accomplish that align. And these were the numbers to actually be able to run those programs, to be able to reduce some of these, you would either reduce the number of people or other things, but really it was, what's our best ability to fund and support these programs? And that's how those numbers aligned. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, so let's look at line item one under community-based grants. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do we have a specific... \nSPEAKER_04:  goal in terms of what we want to achieve or we're just setting this side of pot. \nSPEAKER_04:  and um \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll part of funds. I mean, because I did hear a comment from Council during a budget hearing that they'd like to see. \nSPEAKER_04:  more money allocated toward that particular area. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that we started with some of the other programs and then started to narrow in on an amount to be committed to Funding going into the community one of the things we were looking at is this Conversation of sort of peer mentors and peer peer advocates that we would And so the the number there is actually based on what some of those services would be or you know What some of the staff would be but they would be community-based organizations that receive that funding to do that work So that's that's where that number came from \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, I'll just say it doesn't seem like a, I mean, there was a lot that went into getting this \nSPEAKER_04:  This measure passed and I know there was a lot of community-based organizations that \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, we're working on this and engaged in this. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would \nSPEAKER_04:  think, hope, and think that we are open to. \nSPEAKER_04:  doing a little bit more in that category. I'm curious also about the youth in emerging the JOTS adult strategic plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that for a specific plan or is that to hire consultant to help develop a plan? \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you help? \nSPEAKER_04:  So that's how that's going to work. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that plan exists, that's the plan that we passed earlier this year. But what we really wanted to do is there are certain pieces within that plan that are not funded that are more administrative. So the work that we were looking for there was for a person to do more communications, so bringing communication support, bringing in a half-time fund developer, it takes resources to write grants. And the Health Department right now has one dedicated grant writer for the entire department. And so we are looking to help support the ability to write additional fund, additional grants for youth and youth specific programs. So there's a half-time person for that space. And then a youth strategic plan calls for data and reporting out on its impacts and dashboards and those kinds of things. And we don't have the capacity currently in the Health Department through other mechanisms. We have very few data-focused folks because that's not what grants pay for. And so those are the kinds of administrative, they see them as sort of administrative positions that grants don't normally cover. So we were turning to this space to be able to hire a half-time person, to be able to do the data work that is necessary to show outcome of both measure US, as well as outcomes around the youth development plan, the youth strategic plan. So that was, it adds up to be slightly over an FTE and some additional supports around communication is what that sets. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  stabilize managed housing \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate the clarification. I will just say that I know that there's a lot of interest from the council. \nSPEAKER_04:  on this particular item and I do expect some \nSPEAKER_04:  some augmentation moving forward. My final question is related to MeasureUS, specifically kind of branded as a youth fund or an end for sustainability, youth and sustainability. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  You'll probably come. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, so there are three key categories. So youth, child and youth programs, public health, and then public and community health, and then climate change and sustainability. So those are the three categories, and we tried to align them as much as possible. So even in the climate areas, we're doing workforce for youth, and then we did, you know, we are supporting our older adults and a little bit of extra work in the public health and the public health space. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And how will the older adult program be supported with these funds? \nSPEAKER_05:  So this is in this right now is a halftime. So right now we have an older adult coordinator who was unfunded, was originally, and so we built in halftime funding for that person in homeless services to help focus on older adult housing. And then this fund would pay for the other half of that person's time so that we have a full time healthy Asian coordinator within the health department. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, thank you. I have no other questions on this. Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_02:  Anna Christensen, I think on this speaking as an individual, although the Long Beach area piece network \nSPEAKER_02:  and um \nSPEAKER_02:  the Pueblo, Grenouette, Lens, Protectors, and others have been involved in both climate change and community issues like swimming for everybody. First of all, \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't think personally I can begin to out strategize our health department. \nSPEAKER_02:  I really want to say \nSPEAKER_02:  that I believe our health department in general needs a bigger chunk of the budget and \nSPEAKER_02:  and I trust that you know all of these \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh \nSPEAKER_02:  for the most part have, you know, are trying to just make a lot of it, just catch up with the immense needs of our community. I would have one comment on the climate. \nSPEAKER_02:  I couldn't write fast enough to see exactly how much of that money is to support. And I don't know if that's an outreach, but our strategic community action plan comes out of development services. I think it's been well publicized. I don't think it needs a lot of help from this measure. I do think that it's interesting and kind of part of why I'm here today as a resolution that was just passed unanimously by the City Council to look at building a community pool in the ninth district and where are we going to get that funding. And I do think that it and it was brought up by Councilmember Richardson as a climate change issue. As things get hotter and hotter and hotter, we need cooling centers and people need to know how to swim. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I would hope that there might be some place in this budget to put some funding aside in that direction. \nSPEAKER_02:  towards, you know, and not only just the new facility, but just figuring out how we can get our kids swimming and water safe. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then the other thing I point out is Ambassador. Youth Ambassador sounds pretty fancy, but it looks like for the most part, you're training gardeners. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I know that we have a lot of... \nSPEAKER_02:  uh \nSPEAKER_02:  services, youth core and other course, you know, all the way since the depression and training people, you know, how to do the things that we need in our community.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Make up the largest piece of the city's budget. And one component of that are the pension costs incurred. \nSPEAKER_02:  Historically, Pinch and Coss have been one of the largest deficit drivers for the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  While it is not the highest deficit driving expense currently, it is still an increasing cost factor as the city continues to pay down the unfunded pension liability. \nSPEAKER_02:  This presentation will take you through various changes implemented by CalPERS over the past several years. \nSPEAKER_02:  the projected contribution rates and the status of current costs, the impact of investment returns and the potential next steps as we work to address the city's significant fiscal challenges ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Over the past few years, CalPERS has implemented several changes designed to ensure its long-term fiscal sustainability. \nSPEAKER_02:  First, CalPERS adopted changes to its amortization in rate-smoothing policy, which began to impact our FY16 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  The previous amortization and smoothing policies helped local governments better plan their budgets by avoiding large rate volatility. \nSPEAKER_02:  but it contributed to the underfunding of the city's pension plans. \nSPEAKER_02:  The new rates-moving approach is intended to eliminate the city's unfunded liability. \nSPEAKER_02:  but also exposes the city to a higher volatility in annual costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  second. \nSPEAKER_02:  CalPERS also changed the demographic assumptions, which began to impact our FY17 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  Assumptions such as mortality reflected a population that is living longer. \nSPEAKER_02:  and thus collecting pension benefits over a longer periods of time. \nSPEAKER_02:  This resulted in increased cost to more accurately reflect pensions paid to retirees for a longer period of time. \nSPEAKER_02:  Third, the board adopted a new risk mitigation strategy. \nSPEAKER_02:  which was originally slated to impact the FY18 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  The board felt that their current investment strategy was too volatile with too much risk and so the risk mitigation strategy was implemented to slowly over time make the city's investment mix more conservative. \nSPEAKER_02:  The idea to move to a more conservative mix \nSPEAKER_02:  Only when the investment returns were better than expected, and essentially used some of the investment gains to pay for the cost increases. \nSPEAKER_02:  And in December of 2016, CalPERS voted to lower the actuarially assumed investment rate. \nSPEAKER_02:  also known as the disc gallery, from the previous 7.5% to 7% over three years. \nSPEAKER_02:  with the first year impacting our FY19 rates. \nSPEAKER_02:  This was done to reflect the expectation of the lower rate of returns over time predicted by CalPERS investment advisors. \nSPEAKER_02:  The full impact of this change was realized in FY21. \nSPEAKER_02:  when the discount rate dropped to 7%. \nSPEAKER_02:  proposed FY22 budget assumes a 7% discount rate. \nSPEAKER_02:  Finally. \nSPEAKER_02:  Most recently in 2018, CalPERS adopted changes to their amortization policy. \nSPEAKER_02:  Previously, investment gains or losses were amortized over 30 years, but this new change shortened that period to 20 years. \nSPEAKER_02:  Generally, longer amortization periods provide \nSPEAKER_02:  Lower annual contribution rates the city has to pay. \nSPEAKER_02:  but higher overall costs due to interest. \nSPEAKER_02:  The shorter amortization period will reduce the total interest paid over time. \nSPEAKER_02:  but will likely increase the employer contribution rates as a result. This change impacted our FY22 rates. \nSPEAKER_02:  The projections you see in this presentation factor in all of these changes. \nSPEAKER_02:  To address rising pension costs, several pension reform initiatives have been implemented by the city and the state. \nSPEAKER_02:  Without these proactive initiatives, the city situation would have been much worse. \nSPEAKER_02:  through negotiations and with the partnership of our bargaining group. \nSPEAKER_02:  By FY 14, all employees began paying their full employee contribution rate, which had previously been partly subsidized by the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  Then, Pepper was passed by the state, which implemented new benefit formulas and new contribution requirements for employees hired \nSPEAKER_02:  on or after January 1, 2013. \nSPEAKER_02:  Then in FY 14, the city created and funded the CalPERS Stabilization Fund. \nSPEAKER_02:  This fund was an innovative approach to address potential significant cost fluctuations year over year. \nSPEAKER_02:  which made it a challenge for budget planning. \nSPEAKER_02:  This fund, however, has been discontinued as the risk mitigation approach adopted by CalPERS made it unlikely that the fund would be able to be replenished the way it was originally envisioned. \nSPEAKER_02:  In 2017, the city made the decision to make an early payment towards the unfunded liability portion for FY18. \nSPEAKER_02:  This was done again for the FY19 and the FY20 budgets. \nSPEAKER_02:  The lump sum payment was discontinued in 21 over concerns on cash flow, but was reinstated this year for 22. \nSPEAKER_02:  Generating the savings of 2.1 million in the General Fund and 3.8 million in all funds. \nSPEAKER_02:  Lastly, as part of the most recent round of labor negotiation, \nSPEAKER_02:  Additional PERS pickups beyond the required employee contribution rate were agreed to with some safety groups. \nSPEAKER_02:  The classic police management and classic sworn managers are picking up an additional 3% to pay, beginning \nSPEAKER_02:  October 2019. \nSPEAKER_02:  Classic lifeguards and marine safety picked up an additional 2% to pay beginning in 2021. \nSPEAKER_02:  These additional pickups help reduce the city's cost paid out for pensions. \nSPEAKER_02:  In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the city's pension plan was actually super funded. \nSPEAKER_02:  This means that there was sufficient money in CalPERS fund to cover all the benefits for current employees and retirees. \nSPEAKER_02:  However, a couple changes happened around that time. \nSPEAKER_02:  One, the enhanced benefit formulas were outed for miscellaneous and safety plans. \nSPEAKER_02:  And second, CalPERS estimated future earnings in the fund of 8.25% were too high. \nSPEAKER_02:  Then with the 2009 market crash, where assets earned a negative 5% in 2008 and a negative 24% in 2009, the city experienced significant losses in our pension assets and our funded status declined sharply. \nSPEAKER_02:  Additionally, the asset's moving method used at the time kept our cost low, which on one hand was helpful from a budget perspective. \nSPEAKER_02:  But ultimately meant we were not contributing enough into the fund to repay the losses. \nSPEAKER_02:  Now, however, \nSPEAKER_02:  With all the recent changes from CalPERS, including changes to the Assets Mooting Method, \nSPEAKER_02:  We are on a path towards paying down our unfunded liability and building up our funded status. \nSPEAKER_02:  with the trade-off being significantly higher costs for the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  The current unfinded liability for the city is $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2019. \nSPEAKER_02:  with $665 million for the Vizelania's plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  and $546 million for the safety plan with our funded percentage at 76% and 79.6 respectively. \nSPEAKER_02:  The cities, the investment returns along with the employer and employee contributions are how our pension plans are funded. \nSPEAKER_02:  In terms of timing, the city's contribution rates are partially determined. \nSPEAKER_02:  Investment earnings three years prior. \nSPEAKER_02:  For example, the investment returns ending June 30, 2021 will primarily impact the city's FY24 rates with some impact in 23. \nSPEAKER_02:  The expected discount rate is 7% for FY22. \nSPEAKER_02:  Meaning, the actuarial analysis conducted by CalPERS to determine our rates assume that we will earn at least 7% in the market. \nSPEAKER_02:  Anything below 7% will be a loss and negatively impact our rates. \nSPEAKER_02:  The risk mitigation approach also lessens the benefit we get from good investment returns. Because in the years where there are significant gains, some of the benefit will be used to lower the investment mix to be less risky. \nSPEAKER_02:  by lowering the assumed rate of return. \nSPEAKER_02:  rather than reflecting those lower costs to the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  However, with large enough investment returns, there can be significant positive gains for the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  Recently, CalPERS had excellent investment returns as of June 30, 2021, which came in at 21.3%. \nSPEAKER_02:  This has not been factored into our projections. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  but will be included in our next analysis scheduled for early 2022. \nSPEAKER_02:  These returns will impact the city starting in 24. \nSPEAKER_02:  and may have major positive but temporary impacts. \nSPEAKER_02:  It is also possible that the board will lower the discount rate. \nSPEAKER_02:  significantly. \nSPEAKER_02:  adversely impacting the savings from the high investment return this fall. \nSPEAKER_02:  This slide shows us the potential impact that investment returns can have on our contribution rates, as a result of CalPERS changes that makes the city's contribution more sensitive to investment earnings. \nSPEAKER_02:  The table on the left presents three hypothetical scenarios with moderate, good, or bad investment returns. \nSPEAKER_02:  Based on these assumptions, the line graph chart shows the potential contribution payments that the city would have to make to CalPERS to continue paying the normal cost and the unfunded liability portions. \nSPEAKER_02:  This provides a visual illustration of the significant impact of good year or bad year of investment returns can have on the trajectory of costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  These are hypothetical projections, and in reality, we will need to monitor closely the investment returns and its impacts on our costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  The projection tool being used is designed to focus on the first 5 to 10 years or so. \nSPEAKER_02:  So looking at the long term is not overly representative. \nSPEAKER_02:  as all the curves assume a constant 7% return in the long run. Something that will not happen. \nSPEAKER_02:  This table reflects the employer contribution rates as a percentage of payroll for miscellaneous and safety groups, which are broken out into different categories, as they have different contribution rates per the latest negotiations. \nSPEAKER_02:  As you can see, rates are anticipated to increase until they peak in FY30. \nSPEAKER_02:  While these rates are high and present serious funding issues, \nSPEAKER_02:  They are putting us on track to pay down our large unfunded liabilities and be in a better fiscal position. \nSPEAKER_02:  Again. \nSPEAKER_02:  These figures do not reflect the excellent investment returns as of June 30, 2021. \nSPEAKER_02:  nor any actions that may be taken by the CalPERS Board in November of 2021. \nSPEAKER_02:  The impact of these returns and any board action will be incorporated into our next projection and will start to impact our rates beginning in FY24. \nSPEAKER_02:  Employees also have a required contribution rate, and the slide provides information on their contribution percentages. \nSPEAKER_02:  How hers allows the cities to prepay the employer's unfunded accrued liability amount. \nSPEAKER_02:  In making this lump sum prepayment, there is a substantial savings to the pension cost paid out by the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  The city's first lump sum prepayment in FY 18. \nSPEAKER_02:  was in FY18 and subsequently \nSPEAKER_02:  made prepayments for the 19 and 20 budgets. \nSPEAKER_02:  However, enough for 21. \nSPEAKER_02:  A prepayment was not made due to the concerns about the overall impact on cash exasperated by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_02:  For FY22, with better cash flow projections, \nSPEAKER_02:  The city has opted to make the pre-payment again. \nSPEAKER_02:  This project. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is projected to save the city 3.8 million across all funds and 2.1 million in the general fund and has already been incorporated into the proposed 22 budget figures. \nSPEAKER_02:  As a result, the cost increases in FY22 from pension costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  due to contribution rate changes are minimal. \nSPEAKER_02:  In terms of out-your-projections, pension costs in the journal fund are projected to increase \nSPEAKER_02:  4.3 million in FY23 and another 3.8 million in FY24. \nSPEAKER_02:  These projections are evaluated every year based on the gains and losses, including market returns. \nSPEAKER_02:  which can have a significant impact as we discuss. \nSPEAKER_02:  In conclusion, increased pension costs will continue to be a deficit driver for future projections. \nSPEAKER_02:  and can potentially impact the city's ability to provide services. \nSPEAKER_02:  These increased costs while painful are putting the city on a fiscally prudent path of paying down the unfunded accrued liability. \nSPEAKER_02:  My projections have cost, Pete. \nSPEAKER_02:  Speaking in FY30. \nSPEAKER_02:  After which the costs should start declining. \nSPEAKER_02:  In any given year, rates may fluctuate significantly. \nSPEAKER_02:  impacted by market rate returns. \nSPEAKER_02:  and excellent and recent excellent market rate returns may provide significant good news for the next update. \nSPEAKER_02:  Additionally, we will continue to look for ways to manage costs and will find innovative solutions to be a fiscally sound city. \nSPEAKER_02:  To this end, we will be exploring the feasibility of potential cost saving measures such as \nSPEAKER_02:  issuing pension obligation bonds. \nSPEAKER_02:  in reestablishing a pension rate stabilization fund beginning as early as FY 23. \nSPEAKER_02:  and should obligation bonds can significantly reduce costs. \nSPEAKER_02:  but they also carry the risk and can in some cases. \nSPEAKER_02:  increased cost. \nSPEAKER_02:  Particularly if there is a market decline after the bonds are issued. \nSPEAKER_02:  Stabilization fund. Similar to the one the city established. \nSPEAKER_02:  A few years ago, could take the potential city cost savings from high investment returns. \nSPEAKER_02:  and put them into a stabilization fund to be used to moderate. \nSPEAKER_02:  cost fluctuations in the future years. \nSPEAKER_02:  These are things we will look at and report back to City Council as applicable in the future. \nSPEAKER_02:  This concludes my presentation and we are available for any questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. Council member press. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. I don't really have any questions. This was an excellent presentation. Thank you. It was a really good historical overview. And I think we should try to do this every year. And I also really enjoy when we bring this to the full council because this is a major live unfunded liability that we have that is constantly looming in our budget space. And so I think we should probably have more regular CalPERS obligation reminders when we're thinking about spending money. But I thought the presentation was really good. And I appreciate kind of the history where we've been and how we got to this point. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you and I do appreciate the \nSPEAKER_03:  The report as well, it was very well done. I think there was a... \nSPEAKER_03:  some encouraging news here, particularly the \nSPEAKER_03:  the rate of return at 21% being three times what was protected, which is significant. And that's not every year, I know that. \nSPEAKER_03:  but um \nSPEAKER_03:  Do we have a... \nSPEAKER_03:  I got three to five year. \nSPEAKER_03:  of what the return rate has been in previous years. \nSPEAKER_03:  Because I know that this can't rate just change what two years ago. \nSPEAKER_03:  7% \nSPEAKER_03:  from 7.5%. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, so our, as Routou mentioned, the year ending 630 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's 21.3% that is the positive return that she was mentioning just one comment chair \nSPEAKER_01:  The assumed investment earning is 7%. So anything above that would be the benefit to the city in terms of calculating the rates. Last year for 630-2020, which affects our FY23 rates, it's projected to be around 4.7% the return. And the year ending 630-2019 was 6.7% that affected our FY22 rates. And lastly, 630-2018 that affected our 21 rates was 8.6%. \nSPEAKER_01:  And each of those years, as Rutu mentioned, had different assumed rate of return by CalPERS. So we were at 7.5% assumption and for the year affecting FY21, it has finally dropped down to 7%. \nSPEAKER_01:  So even if, for example, in a year where we have 4.7% return, which is a positive, because we're assuming 7%, it would be factored in as a loss. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the calculation of our rates for that particular year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Understood, understood. So, so that I'm clear, 21.3% return is good. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, it is good. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I want to be clear on that. That's good news and I'll accept that. I know some of our employee groups are looking at that closely as well. And CalPERS is a whole. That's a major. Do we have any idea what? \nSPEAKER_03:  what caused the significant shift or rate of return. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that's just dependent on the market. It also has to do, it is also impacted by the type of investment mix that CalPERS chooses to invest into. That's part of the strategy or some of the changes that they are implementing is a few years back, CalPERS felt that their investment mix was too risky. So they are trying to shift their investment mix into a portfolio that is little less risky, but then the flip side of that is you have less, it's more stable but less chance of very significant returns. But it's the market, it's hard to predict and it really depends and a lot of it is sometimes chance. But also in terms of what we can control, it's the type of mix that we're investing into. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I want to follow Cal FERS and their investments right now. That looks pretty good. \nSPEAKER_03:  The other question I have regarding the pinch and obligation bond, \nSPEAKER_03:  and looking into doing that and \nSPEAKER_03:  as early as FY 23. Is there any reason why we're not doing that now? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, Chair Austin, that's a great question. Historically, there have been a lot of reservations about pension obligation funds. \nSPEAKER_01:  because while they do offer \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  you know \nSPEAKER_01:  Like very tempting options in terms of being able to invest quite a bit of cash into our assets or and to give a lot of cash to CalPERS. It does have risk and it doesn't often work out because you may issue the bonds and then the market could crash. That is something that we've actually experienced as a city. \nSPEAKER_01:  where we were one of the highest entities funded in CalPERS and we were hurt the most in 09 or one of the agencies that were hurt the most. So there's a lot of risk, there's a lot of analysis that needs to be done. \nSPEAKER_01:  That being said, it is something we want to look into and look at to see what the market's looking like. \nSPEAKER_01:  way out the different risks, do some scenarios. So that is something we still have to do, but one of the things we have on our plates to look into as we look into all options of generating savings for the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right. \nSPEAKER_03:  Again, I think this is an excellent report. It shows that our pensions are... \nSPEAKER_03:  76% funded and almost 80% funded respectively. I think that is pretty good when you look at other public agencies. I'd like to open this up for public comment, if any. \nSPEAKER_03:  Seeing no public comment on this excellent report, I would like to take it back to Council Member Price. \nSPEAKER_00:  Just on that last note, Chair Austin, what are there any cities that are in the 80 or 90% range? \nSPEAKER_01:  There may be some cities with smaller assets or benefit packages. I'm not aware of them. So we would have to look into that and provide you with that list if interested. But I think in terms of many agencies struggling with their unfunded liability percentage is very common. And long beach is definitely not out of the norm in that sense. And so I think all agencies are collectively working to build back many of the losses that they've experienced. That's great. Thank you. That's really helpful information. Appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Alright, let's take a moment. Let's move the second."

Good evening, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  This presentation will provide an overview of the measure A uses that are included as part of the proposed FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_05:  We also have the Public Works Department here. \nSPEAKER_05:  who will provide details on the infrastructure projects funded by Measure A. \nSPEAKER_05:  Since 2017, revenues generated from measure A have allowed the city to fund infrastructure and other one-time projects. \nSPEAKER_05:  as well as maintain and restore public safety services which would have otherwise been reduced. \nSPEAKER_05:  This funding has been vital to maintaining the health and safety of the community. \nSPEAKER_05:  through not only the maintenance and restoration of police and fire services. \nSPEAKER_05:  but also through funding for infrastructure investments, homelessness outreach, mobility projects. \nSPEAKER_05:  such as Allie Streets, Kerb Ram, sidewalks, bike lanes, and signage, parks and library improvements. \nSPEAKER_05:  Restoration of City Own Facility and support for Community Hospital. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mejure has truly been a vital and transformative funding source for the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  In FY22, Measurery Revenues are anticipated to generate approximately 69 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is about 6 million higher than the adopted FY21 budget, which, as a reminder, was developed at the beginning of the pandemic when little was known about the pandemic impact to this revenue source. \nSPEAKER_05:  In addition to 69 million in revenues, in FY22, about 6 million will be released from reserves. \nSPEAKER_05:  to fund previously planned projects with cash needs occurring in different years. \nSPEAKER_05:  Some of these projects include the rebuilding of the police and fire academy buildings and the funding of public safety radio replacement lease costs. \nSPEAKER_05:  the total use of measure A and FY22. \nSPEAKER_05:  amount to 75 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  This includes 34 million of structural uses. \nSPEAKER_05:  to maintain and restore police and fire services. \nSPEAKER_05:  administrative support for the Mejore program and set aside for the Mejore B. Stabilization Fund. \nSPEAKER_05:  This also includes about 41 million in one-time uses for public safety, infrastructure projects, and support of the community hospital. \nSPEAKER_05:  All of these uses are in line with the resolution of tent. \nSPEAKER_05:  of measure A spending. \nSPEAKER_05:  This slide provides more detail on these uses. There is about 53 or 52.5 million allocated to support public safety and health, operations, and one-time investments. \nSPEAKER_05:  A total of 26.4 million is for maintaining police and fire services. \nSPEAKER_05:  or the equivalent of 143 sworn positions retained over the years. \nSPEAKER_05:  that may have otherwise been reduced but for measure a funding. \nSPEAKER_05:  It also includes 6.73 million for public safety restorations made over the years. \nSPEAKER_05:  for police South Division, Fire Engine 8, paramedic rescue 12. \nSPEAKER_05:  police academy staffing and quality of life officers. \nSPEAKER_05:  The restorations added a total of 39 public safety related FTEs. \nSPEAKER_05:  One-time funds of about 19 million have been allocated for a community hospital, the least cost of replacing public safety radios. \nSPEAKER_05:  the Neighborhood Safety Program and the Police Department at NGN 17. \nSPEAKER_05:  As a reminder, Engine 17 was originally only funded in the Measuray Plan for two years. So FY20 and FY21. \nSPEAKER_05:  However, funds to maintain Engine 17 for an additional year \nSPEAKER_05:  has been included in FY22, consistent with the overall city-wide general fund approach of avoiding service reductions in FY22, made possible by federal funds covering the general fund shortfall for one year. \nSPEAKER_05:  The total measure I set aside for infrastructure in FY22 is 21.6 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  This includes 6.3 million from ability 1.2 million for parks and recreation. \nSPEAKER_05:  14.1 million for public facilities. \nSPEAKER_05:  and additional details and updates on these and other infrastructure projects will be provided by public works in their portion of the presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Lastly. \nSPEAKER_05:  In addition to public safety, health, and infrastructure uses, \nSPEAKER_05:  The FY22 Measuray budget includes approximately 208,000 for administrative support. \nSPEAKER_05:  and a 690,000 set assigned for the Measure B Stabilization Fund. \nSPEAKER_05:  Measure B was a companion ballot initiative to measure A, which established a budget stabilization fund. And this fund receives automatic deposits or transfers of 1% of any new general tax revenues generated each year, starting in FY17. \nSPEAKER_05:  Then set someception through FY19 about 1.7 million has been set aside from measure A revenue. \nSPEAKER_05:  into the Measure B Stabilization Fund. \nSPEAKER_05:  No funds were set aside in FY20 as the city ended the year in a shortfall situation in the general fund. \nSPEAKER_05:  is part of the solution to mitigate the shortfall half of the measure be reserved was withdrawn. \nSPEAKER_05:  For FY21 and FY22, while shortfalls are being projected again, it is anticipated that the Long Beach Recovery Act will cover these shortfalls. And as a result, the current assumption is that the deposits for measure B will occur in FY21 and FY22. \nSPEAKER_05:  Finally, before turning it over to public works, I'd like to recap the measure a tax history and what to expect looking forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  Beginning in January 2017, Measure A increased sales tax by 1% for the first six years and then was slated to decrease to 0.5% for four years before sun setting. \nSPEAKER_05:  With the 2020 voter approved change, the 10-year sunset was eliminated. \nSPEAKER_05:  and the 1% stays in effect until voters decide to end it at a later election. \nSPEAKER_05:  The new dollars approved by voters do not begin to be realized until 2023, so these funds are not part of this FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_05:  In FY23, measure A will drop from 1% to 0.75%. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is in order to stay within the tax rate limit due to Pounty Measure H. \nSPEAKER_05:  which levies a quarter percent rate and was approved prior to the 2020 voter change for measure A. \nSPEAKER_05:  Measure A will return to the full 1% rate in 2028 when measure H sunsets. \nSPEAKER_05:  So this creates an interesting dynamic where the 2020 change results and significantly more revenue than was expected beginning in 2023, which will be the 0.75% versus what we were expecting the 0.5%. \nSPEAKER_05:  But also, total measure A revenues being collected will be significantly less than it is currently today, which is the 1 percent compared to the 0.75 percent. \nSPEAKER_05:  As we look to the future, staff will begin to work on a new out-year measure and infrastructure plan to begin in 2023 when the voter approved change. \nSPEAKER_05:  in measuring revenues take effect. \nSPEAKER_05:  This will be evaluated and brought to council as part of the proposed FY23 budget process. \nSPEAKER_05:  And now I will turn it over to Eric Lopez, director of Public Works for the second half of the presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Actually, we will turn it over to Jonathan Bowen, our business services officer in public works. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Grace. Good afternoon, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. My name's Jonathan Bolin, and I am the Budget Services Officer for the Department of Public Works. \nSPEAKER_01:  Today we will be reviewing a few Measure A highlights. They look at some recently completed Measure A projects and review the FY22 proposed Measure A infrastructure budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Everyone should be familiar with the Measurer Investment Plan, which was first presented back in 2016. \nSPEAKER_01:  to date over 73% of the measure commitments in the original plan presented to City Council in 2016 have been completed with many more nearing completion within the next year. \nSPEAKER_01:  Overall, measuring dollars have contributed greatly to our city's infrastructure. To date, 31 parts projects have been completed, including multiple playgrounds, improvements at community centers, and part facilities. \nSPEAKER_01:  with measuring. \nSPEAKER_01:  Public Works has been able to rehabilitate approximately 440 lane miles of city streets and pave nearly six miles of formerly dirt alleys. \nSPEAKER_01:  Additionally, public works has completed 20 projects related to public facilities. This includes four fire station projects and eight library projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  pictured on this slide is the Misery Funded Jenny Rivera Park playground. \nSPEAKER_01:  From inception to date, over $138 million of Measure A has been allocated towards improving the city's infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_01:  We track this funding in five categorical programs as indicated on the slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  Beaches, mobility, parks and recreation, public facilities and utilities. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll now review a few recently completed Missouri funded projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  To date, over 72 million has been allocated towards mobility projects. These projects include rehabilitating major and residential streets, paving dirt alleys, updating city street signage, street light upgrades, bridge improvements, and curb and sidewalk improvements. \nSPEAKER_01:  The paved alley, shown on this slide, was not too long ago. \nSPEAKER_01:  impassable due to the brief. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here's a picture of what the alley looked like prior to being paid. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is an Allie near 21st Street and Hill Street. \nSPEAKER_01:  Shown here is a paving project on Cedar Avenue between Seventh Street and Anheim. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here is another Paving project on sternly avenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  between a P-body street and Cone it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here's another Paving Project on Golden Avenue between 6th and 7th Street. \nSPEAKER_01:  And here's a recently completed Paving Project on a Bisbo. \nSPEAKER_01:  avenue between Tenth Street and PCH. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'd like to highlight the work of our curb and sidewalk team and what they've been doing with Measure A's investment. \nSPEAKER_01:  shown here is a recently completed ADA Curbraum improvement at Olive Avenue and Sunrise Boulevard. \nSPEAKER_01:  Before this improvement, there was no easy way for someone on the sidewalk to get across sunrise Boulevard, but as you can see, this improvement makes a big difference to the path of travel. \nSPEAKER_01:  Lastly, I'd like to highlight some recently completed alley work, shown here is a former dirt alley east of Louis Avenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  And here's a recently paved alley east of Gale Avenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  Moving on to parks and recreation projects, as I previously stated, 31 parks projects have been completed with Measure A funding to date totaling a near $20 million investment of completed parks projects. Completed projects are listed on this slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  The most recently completed Measure A Funded Parks Project. \nSPEAKER_01:  is the new Cherry Park playground. \nSPEAKER_01:  A grand opening ceremony for the new playground was held on July 24th. \nSPEAKER_01:  As you can see, \nSPEAKER_01:  the kids are enjoying the improvement. \nSPEAKER_01:  The new playground consists of two age appropriate play structures. \nSPEAKER_01:  improvements include \nSPEAKER_01:  new play equipment resurfacing in EBA and safety enhancements. \nSPEAKER_01:  Moving on to public facility projects, public works has completed 21 projects to date listed on this slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  these 21 projects total in near 8.5 million dollar measuring investment. \nSPEAKER_01:  At this time, I would like to highlight the citywide facility condition assessment that is funded by Measure A. \nSPEAKER_01:  This assessment. \nSPEAKER_01:  has been completed with approximately 270 city-owned structures evaluated with an over $647 million dollar. \nSPEAKER_01:  of potential need identified. \nSPEAKER_01:  Nearly eight and a half million dollars of measure A has been allocated to the facility condition assessment and improvement program. \nSPEAKER_01:  After reviewing the results of the facility condition assessment report, staff has outlined eight projects to fund with a portion. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the FCA dollars. \nSPEAKER_01:  Listed here are the next eight projects identified in the FCA to receive measure eight dollars. \nSPEAKER_01:  listed here. \nSPEAKER_01:  The eight projects with budget and scope. Central Health Building, Veterans Park Community Center, Coolidge Park, \nSPEAKER_01:  Joe Rogers Field. \nSPEAKER_01:  main health. \nSPEAKER_01:  Drake Park Community Center, Sheriff Park Community Center, and Wardlow Park Community Center, restroom. \nSPEAKER_01:  In addition to the projects completed with Measure A funding. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we have just reviewed. 10 additional projects, five in parks and recreation and five public facility projects, are anticipated to be completed by summer 2022. \nSPEAKER_01:  These projects are listed here in total nearly $9 million of Measure A investment into the city's infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_01:  Switching focus to the FY22 proposed measure A infrastructure budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  In FY22, over 21.5 million dollars of measure A is planned to be allocated to infrastructure improvements. \nSPEAKER_01:  This includes 6.3 million from mobility projects, which breaks down to $400,000 for additional Allian improvements, 1.1 million for arterial street improvements, and 4.8 million for curb and sidewalk ADA path of travel improvements. \nSPEAKER_01:  Pictured here is the recently rehabilitated channel drive, next to the S.U.L.B. and the Veterans Hospital. \nSPEAKER_01:  The FY $22 also include 1.2 million for Parks and Recreations projects included. \nSPEAKER_01:  including $700,000 for citywide playground in park metany maintenance as well as $500,000 for the Drake Park Restroom replacement project. \nSPEAKER_01:  The chart here is the Golden Grove Event Center, which was recently completed. \nSPEAKER_01:  And lastly, public facilities is planned to receive $14.1 million in FY22 measure a funding. This includes $10.5 million for the PD Academy building, $1.6 million for critical infrastructure reserves, $800,000 for the Fire Department Academy, an additional $700,000 for the facility condition assessment and improvement. \nSPEAKER_01:  program. \nSPEAKER_01:  and $532,000 for Fire Station 9. \nSPEAKER_01:  Overall, including the FY22 proposed investment, Measure A has contributed nearly $160 million to the city's infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_01:  It is hard to imagine the city's infrastructure today without the investment of measure A. \nSPEAKER_01:  That concludes my presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you and I imagine we have a few questions. Council Member Price. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know we're going to be having a study session later as well with the full council. So I want to make sure that I don't take too much time asking questions that I know I'm going to be asking about tonight. But I think for me, the biggest part of the discussion is that we're going to be asking \nSPEAKER_04:  thing that pops out is you know a lot of times at council I think all of the council members like to celebrate new playgrounds they're always such a positive addition in every community. \nSPEAKER_04:  and um \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm seeing from this that the budget for most of the playgrounds is somewhere around a million dollars for each. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that about right for the signature playgrounds? \nSPEAKER_06:  Council member, that was the number from a year or two ago. We're now looking at an increase due to just cost escalation. We're looking at about on average for a signature playground between a million to a million and a half. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, that sounds good. And then also I noticed that we have coming up to community centers. They're at about 1.3. Is that the, is that just the measure a portion or the total cost of those projects? \nSPEAKER_06:  That's just to measure a portion. The facilities conditions assessments that were recently completed recommend a higher volume, a higher level of work. We are looking to do some of the higher priority improvements, like roof or age fat, those that conspire or out of control if we don't make those repairs immediately. But those facilities do have more need than just that budgeted amount. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. And so I know that's the other thing that I think all council members would love to see is more community centers, at least one in each district that can be a hub for \nSPEAKER_04:  Park's Reckon Marine Programming, but as well as meeting space and you know other public serving facilities that we may not have access through our joint use agreements with the school district or \nSPEAKER_04:  because some libraries are just not large enough to accommodate that public serving need. Like I'll speak for the third district, you know, Bayshore just does not really have a meeting space. And so a community center would be a really great thing to have. \nSPEAKER_04:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  And just kind of looking at that, is that at all on the priority list to upgrade community centers? Because I know \nSPEAKER_04:  We go out in park one. I don't know what the total budget on that one was. Was it somewhere around 10 million total? \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I have to look at a look up the specific number, but it will somewhere between 5 and 10. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, so maybe it's possible to maybe not do something because I know for me we'd love to be able to have playgrounds and a community center and I know it's it's really kind of unfair to want both because since they need us so high throughout the city. So is there like an option for helping \nSPEAKER_04:  Each district created community center doesn't have to be a full rebuild and it doesn't have to be a 10 million dollar project but \nSPEAKER_04:  something that provides a hub in each district that's kind of associated with that district as a meeting location. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, Council Member, I would just add that the priorities do differ sometimes between council districts, you know, and in some council districts are multiple community centers, and sometimes the needs outlined in our facilities, conditions, assessments and the recommendations may not always be aligned. So I think at the study session later today, we're going to talk about the different needs and the level of needs because as we talk about future investment and how we're going to make those investments, it's important that we outline all of those needs and for really point out that we don't have enough money to meet them at least to this point. So that's a discussion that we haven't had that I think we need to have. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, I agree. I mean, I think when we're envisioning what what the plan is for the city knowing how limited our resources is. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think all of us, you know, kind of like a family does, have to be realistic about how much money is there. And maybe we don't, maybe what we're seeking is not a full remodel or a full rebuild, but maybe there are some opportunities to enhance and modernize, kind of like we're doing with Bayshore Library. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, yeah, they sure library. Just enhance at a much lower price point so that we can have a playground and a community center and \nSPEAKER_04:  not take away from the rest of the family so to speak because it's such limited resources to share but I just would like us to be thinking that way moving forward that the projects if the building is there and it structurally sound. \nSPEAKER_04:  What can we do with the existing structure to make it inviting and make it seem fresh and accessible without a much more expensive rebuild? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Council Member. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So yeah, thank you for the report. I'm noticing here at about 45% of our proposed FY22 measure a allocation to structural. \nSPEAKER_02:  and 55% is about 55% is one time. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  And I think, you know, \nSPEAKER_02:  As we're out in the community, we hear a lot and we talk about this just about every week that you've been for us, so Mr. Lopez. \nSPEAKER_02:  about residential streets. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't see a line item in this year's allocation for residential streets. Um, my, my, my, my corrector. \nSPEAKER_06:  You are a current corrector Austin, you know, this year we had some items on the measure a Improcession investment plan on the spending plan that we are committed to that were recommended to be funded and those are big ticket items like the police academy The $10 million set aside We also have the additional ADA Settlement agreement dollars that we had a set aside as more than we anticipated So that's a big one. So as we as we look at the different needs and the different priorities and programs It becomes very difficult to fund everything. So I think your observation is correct Last year and the year before we were able to make a bigger investment of measure a into streets, specifically residential streets I Think we're we're we're overall we're pretty close to the allocations we did yesterday We just use different sources not measure a to get us to fund the residential street program But if I recall the CIP presentation and Jonathan can correct me. I think for residential streets were pretty aligned to last year \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so in terms of... \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'll just say congratulations. I know we're \nSPEAKER_02:  about 75 or 173% of our \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a plan has been complete. Where are we at in terms of the \nSPEAKER_02:  the goal there. I mean are we on goal or \nSPEAKER_06:  So lucky for me when I took over the director positions last year, you know, I was told here's the last 25, 30% of the measure A plan go finish it. As I look to all the remaining projects, there's some pretty complex projects in there, including the four arterios trees we've been talking about for the past few years, market, artisia, anaheim, surabaker, that have a very high dollar number and that we depend on other state and federal funding sources to fully fund. We've made progress on some of those, but we still need to make progress on more. That's a big chunk of what's remaining. You know, we have some local streets that we got to finish. Yes, we have some facilities that we have to finish, but a big chunk of the remaining, at least from a dollar standpoint, that we have remaining to complete is the major streets program. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I want to get back to that, but before I do, I wanted to... \nSPEAKER_02:  just tackle the reserves, the critical infrastructure reserve. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there a reserve in measure $8 right now? Have we spent everything or are we building that reserve back? \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair Osmond, are you referring to the measure B reserve or in the infrastructure allocation, they also have a critical infrastructure reserve? \nSPEAKER_02:  That's what I'm looking at the infrastructure allocation. \nSPEAKER_02:  And what do we do? I mean, why is that a reserve? And... \nSPEAKER_02:  Why aren't we spending that? \nSPEAKER_06:  Tristan, we do spend that. So the critical facilities set aside. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we have, we use those as needs come up for, say, say, the HBAC system went out on a sooner than we expected, or say we have a plumbing leak on a rooftop and we have emergency unanticipated roof repairs that we need to make. This is the fund, the account that we use to be able to address immediately and tackle those problems instead of spending months and months trying to figure out how we're going to do the funding source. So we like to keep a specific amount in this account as we, as we, as we, expanded and, and draw it down, then we come back and we ask for more as part of the budgeting process. So this time around, we're asking for an additional allocation. I would say that this has been a lifesaver, literally as lifesaver in the past for us, to be able to immediately address critical facility needs. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we know that there is a \nSPEAKER_02:  potentially an infrastructure bill making its way through Washington DC and you know expect that Long Beach will get \nSPEAKER_02:  and allocation there. \nSPEAKER_02:  Should we get that allocation? \nSPEAKER_02:  Could that augment our measure A strategy in terms of infrastructure? \nSPEAKER_02:  infrastructure strategy. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I would say that's going to be a big part of our infrastructure strategy. We're hearing that there's, and we're talking about this at 6 p.m. But we're hearing from the legislation that there's not going to be direct appropriations that the money's going to pass through the state and comparative opportunities. So we're going to have to position ourselves to compete for some of those funds. But as we are successful, they definitely will provide opportunities and may even benefit our current infrastructure planning. We're able to use certain projects or fund certain projects with those funds as opposed to measure A. So that would be a huge benefit. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would say that. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm trying to get back to funding residential streets. And if we can offset that with some of these big ticket items, that will be, I think, with facilities improvement items that we have. I think that will be a great strategy. And I'm sure we'll be talking about that more when we. \nSPEAKER_02:  Have a good day. \nSPEAKER_02:  hearing with the council. I'm just having \nSPEAKER_02:  I thank you for this presentation. Measure A is obviously a great source. Resource, it's proven to \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  to help our city and deliver projects in a big way over the last few years and look forward to. \nSPEAKER_02:  continuing to do that. I did have one final question related to \nSPEAKER_02:  public facilities and all these there's some big ticket items here with the police academy building. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  Critical infrastructure. I guess I can work with that. But fire station nine. What exactly is that? $532,000 kind of fund \nSPEAKER_06:  It's an additional allocation for fire station now. A nine is not fully funded, obviously. I believe we've set aside $10 million to date for fire station nine, but it's a need that's identified and we're developing our strategy to fully fund that. As you know, we're actively working on the design and the environmental review phase. So we want to continue setting aside money to get to that point where we're ready to complete the designs and go through the comparative bid process. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that too could be one of those infrastructure projects that we formed with federal dollars potentially. \nSPEAKER_06:  That would be amazing. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you so much for the questions, Council Member. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  public. Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. I'm here representing the Long Beach Area Peace Network. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  I know there's going to be a session later, but I took the time to focus in. \nSPEAKER_00:  on this and it's really interesting how similar it is in some ways to the general fund where \nSPEAKER_00:  We're \nSPEAKER_00:  70% of these monies go to police and fire. Now, \nSPEAKER_00:  We need guys with guns and we need guys with hoses. \nSPEAKER_00:  but there's other ways to be safe. Those are emergencies. \nSPEAKER_00:  Right? And we need places for them to learn how to do what they do, like an academy. \nSPEAKER_00:  But do we need to spend? \nSPEAKER_00:  all this money on the police and fire. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  At the expense because it's a choice like Susie said we'd like to have a playground and a meeting hall But we can't have both so the percentages here the mobility the streets that awesome talking about that's only 12% of this budget But you know we need safe safe streets. We don't need cars, you know With bump crashing in in the potholes and stuff, but when it comes to parks and wrecks there's nothing so you know \nSPEAKER_00:  a playground equipment when there's no swimming pools in Long Beach. So now we've been asked, the city has been asked to find money for this pool. \nSPEAKER_00:  in North Long Beach, right? And maybe we can look at some of that federal money. Because that infrastructure is public safety infrastructure. Spools are not sports. They're places where people learn how to keep themselves safe and healthy. And I think the concept, whoever designed this budget, I'm so sorry, well not really. I mean, I do apologize for not knowing more about it, not being maybe involved earlier. Maybe all this money, there's no choice. There's no wiggle room. These projects are already there. But. \nSPEAKER_00:  This level of priority. \nSPEAKER_00:  for guns and hoses is not the way families budget. \nSPEAKER_00:  And when we look at our US military budget, which is way over half. \nSPEAKER_00:  The thing I used to tell my high school students is, you're budgeting for your family. So do you go and buy a guard dog and a security system and triple locks for your doors and not have enough for food? So when we look at whether it was the people here earlier from our health department trying to keep kids healthy, when we look at what LeBopin stands for, which is sharing and equity of these resources to keep ourselves safe, \nSPEAKER_00:  Let's not have this level. This is imbalance. This is a totally unbalanced budget. I mean, a 10 and a half million dollars for a police academy. So what I came to say is, as we go forward with this, is there any way any of these priorities that just a little bit could be shaved off? I don't think there's much to shave off in the parks and wreck budget, and probably not in the mobility. But in this budget for the police and fire departments, could maybe the radio replacement guys for 13 and a half million? Could maybe we spend maybe just two million less on radios? Could, you know, I've given, I mean, the death pawn thing, that was a couple of weeks ago. But I now I understand that that's a water safety issue. Okay, fine. But these are huge numbers. I mean, the police department academy, 10 and a half million dollars. So just try to see if you could just, \nSPEAKER_03:  $9 million. \nSPEAKER_00:  Pile up if possible and later on also in larger discussions. Thank you so much. Where do we find this money? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_02:  I appreciate those comments. \nSPEAKER_02:  Mr. Lopez, great. Can you guys just briefly explain the measure A in infrastructure investment plan? That was adopted by the council a few years ago. And many of these major projects were part of that. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_06:  That is correct. And we showed it in one of the slides. It's the plan, the commitment that was created back in FY 2017. And we continue to fund it every year since and implement it. So we've been tracking our progress toward completing those commitments. And that's all we mentioned that were 70. \nSPEAKER_06:  73% fully complete with those commitments and going strong to finish to 100%. \nSPEAKER_02:  And some of these major projects, do we expect to build them in FY22? Or is it just where are we funding them to? \nSPEAKER_02:  Is this a one year project, two year project? \nSPEAKER_06:  know, we've been working on some of these major projects for a while now. And you know, some of them every fiscal year, some of them will get to the point where we're ready to bid them out and start construction. And for some of them, construction can take one or two years, depending on the complexity of the project. I think the Doug Pond was mentioned earlier, you know, that's a project that got some funding and we're working on getting the final bids completed. And starting construction. So it's based on the projects that are at different levels of completion and you know, we can get into specifics. But we're well represented at different projects being at different parts. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, well thank you so much for that very thorough. I just wanted to get some further explanation for the council as well as the public on how and why such projects are being funded. And here are no other questions. We've heard from public comment. I'd like to go to a vote on that item number four. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ocean Care."

These are documents that have been already in a public sphere or conversations, questions from the council. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any public comment? I'm sure it's in the agenda. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hearing none, let's vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  on item number five. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're full. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so that concludes our agenda for today of the Budget Oversight Committee. I want to thank everyone for joining us and we'll see you."
