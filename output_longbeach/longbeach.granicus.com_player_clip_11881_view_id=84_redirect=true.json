        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Item number two is \nSPEAKER_02:  relates to the report on local county and state agencies and their capabilities as related to enforcement of ethics laws. \nSPEAKER_02:  And this we have the memo submitted by \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_02:  Amy Weber from the City Attorney's Office and \nSPEAKER_02:  Amy, why don't you start with whatever. \nSPEAKER_02:  comments you want to make and \nSPEAKER_02:  latest through. \nSPEAKER_02:  That would please. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, at your, we are left being a home for you requested a report on local county and state agencies. \nSPEAKER_05:  and what they had to offer to the city in the way of ethics enforcement. \nSPEAKER_05:  So this is kind of an overview of \nSPEAKER_05:  of what the city currently did. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it kind of breaks down into the kind of violation that we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the first category is violation of section, of violations of the political reform. \nSPEAKER_05:  The political reform outages is sweeping. \nSPEAKER_05:  kind of disclosure and good government law that was passed I think in the 1970s. \nSPEAKER_05:  and it's primary focus with regard to \nSPEAKER_05:  The big thing, the big push is to try and get people to disclose. \nSPEAKER_05:  their business interests and it gets they may have received. \nSPEAKER_05:  travel they may have taken. \nSPEAKER_05:  so that it's possible for the public and for the enforcement agency, which in this case is the Fair Political Practice Commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  to determine whether or not there are conflicts of interest present as defined in the political reform act. \nSPEAKER_05:  So basically, \nSPEAKER_05:  And you have probably discerned from communications with the city clerk's office. \nSPEAKER_05:  elected officials are given a form and have to disclose under penalty of per degree whether or not they have certain kinds of interest. \nSPEAKER_05:  And those are kept on file with the City Clerk's Office and the FPPC. \nSPEAKER_05:  and generally speaking. \nSPEAKER_05:  those if there are violations they are brought forward on a complaint basis. \nSPEAKER_05:  and believe it or not, it's \nSPEAKER_05:  fairly common. There are actually our complaints that are made to the FPPC. \nSPEAKER_05:  where they'll open an investigation on the basis of \nSPEAKER_05:  a complaint that a citizen makes a constituent. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  And the FTPC being a state agency and they deal with all the elected officials and employees in the state. \nSPEAKER_05:  They're a pretty overburdened group. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it sometimes takes them a while to resolve. \nSPEAKER_05:  Resolve complaint, especially the more complicated ones. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are also some that are resolved within a couple of days. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  They are the primary. \nSPEAKER_05:  enforcers of the law. \nSPEAKER_05:  The other thing that falls into this category is \nSPEAKER_05:  late. \nSPEAKER_05:  late filings, late filings are failing to file. \nSPEAKER_05:  Both of those things, the FPPC also enforces and they, \nSPEAKER_05:  There are penalties, financial penalties associated with that. \nSPEAKER_05:  And they do kind of add up. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's something that the city clerk's office is always very careful to advise people to be sure and get your \nSPEAKER_05:  you're filing in on time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, may I stop you for one second and ask a question about the FPPC? \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  So does this rule, does it apply just to electives and members of commissions or does it also apply to employees of the city? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So it applies to elected officials and appointed officials, and it also applies to designated to the employees. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the way that works is that the FPPC requests the needs and other agencies. \nSPEAKER_05:  to come up with what they call a conflict code and indicate the people that are in positions of authority. \nSPEAKER_05:  who would be in a position to potentially. \nSPEAKER_05:  abuse their trust. So for example if you're a department head \nSPEAKER_05:  you would have to file a statement of economic interest so that because you're in a position of some authority where you \nSPEAKER_05:  have some influence into who gets the contract, for example. \nSPEAKER_05:  So in the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are that is. \nSPEAKER_05:  They have however many departments, they have 35 departments or so. \nSPEAKER_05:  Each one has a conflict code, which is updated every two years. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  most employees is actually. \nSPEAKER_05:  are designated filers. They're required to file 4,700. Do not all, but kind of the lower dial, you are on the totem pole. \nSPEAKER_05:  the less authority you have. \nSPEAKER_05:  the less likely you are to have to file a immunokinemic interest. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the data answer the question. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, well, yes, of course, I have a few more, which is how many employees are. \nSPEAKER_02:  Our designated then. \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean, how many employees are there total and approximately how many of those are actually required to do this? \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, that's a number we might have to get from the City Clerk's Office, but I would say there are several thousand. \nSPEAKER_02:  several thousand that fill it out. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, I believe it is a couple thousand, but we can get you an exact number. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. Report back to you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, and how many employees are there overall, would you say? \nSPEAKER_05:  Becky, do you have an idea of how many employees there are overall? I would think in the neighborhood of \nSPEAKER_05:  3 or 4,000. \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's closer to 6,000. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh wow. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And the other thing I wanted to ask about that are \nSPEAKER_02:  I understand I'm aware that the FEPC also will issue opinions. \nSPEAKER_02:  about \nSPEAKER_02:  ethical. \nSPEAKER_02:  or possible conflicts that have that \nSPEAKER_02:  that. \nSPEAKER_02:  the city may be concerned about or a person. \nSPEAKER_02:  at the city may be concerned about could. \nSPEAKER_02:  Could you just very briefly. \nSPEAKER_02:  confirm that or and because I think it's important. \nSPEAKER_02:  to all. \nSPEAKER_02:  that \nSPEAKER_02:  that the commission should know about. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Absolutely, they do that. It is a very \nSPEAKER_05:  helpful to all I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  You can they have a website, you can request advice, informal advice through the website. \nSPEAKER_05:  You can request advice by telephone or by email. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you want formal advice, the government code allows you to request formal advice. \nSPEAKER_05:  which for certain elected officials, especially will provide immunity in the case in \nSPEAKER_05:  in the case that they decide to bring somebody decide to bring an action against you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  So that is a very important tool, I think, for a lot of \nSPEAKER_05:  for a lot of people. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that advice can take a while for them to generate, but \nSPEAKER_05:  in my experience they have always been very responsive. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Are there any other questions or should I keep going with? \nSPEAKER_05:  Government Code Section 1090. \nSPEAKER_03:  I guess I have a question. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know that you are going to probably hold those numbers for \nSPEAKER_03:  chairwice. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd be curious on the level or the percentage of non-compliance or late filings and what comes of those. You know what does the city have a process on addressing that? \nSPEAKER_05:  I am generally aware my office doesn't, this is handled by the city clerk's office, but \nSPEAKER_05:  I know that there is a process for late filing. \nSPEAKER_05:  kind of an extensive reminder process that happens. \nSPEAKER_05:  but ultimately, \nSPEAKER_05:  after a number of reminders and letters and so emails and calls and so forth. \nSPEAKER_05:  If there's no response and the FPPC chooses to follow up on that. \nSPEAKER_05:  then \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, then you are... \nSPEAKER_05:  subject to the jurisdiction of SPPC. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, I can. I can. Follow up. Oh, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, I think the external audit found a number of missing and laid filings. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, so like what our process is is what we'll follow up with. We'll send out an initial like email from the system letting everyone know that the file. And I think that's something you guys are familiar with that you received. It gives you the deadlines and then we'll follow up by email and phone calls. And then at a certain point, I'm not sure what that is because I'm not completely in the loop for this process. But at some point, we'll forward all the names which is generally a handful, I believe, to the FPPC and at that point, they will begin assessing fines and follow up with those individuals. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  And that's something I can have someone in our office present on and we can ask someone for the FBBC comment as well if you guys want to have a presentation on that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm not necessarily, we may need the presentation. I guess I was curious if the city has any mechanism that they, where they take action, regardless of the FEPC's response. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, it's really the FPPC, these are their forms, this is either their rules. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so the FPP kind of has the primary \nSPEAKER_05:  responsibility for following up on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the city attorney's office and the city clerk's office attempts to \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  achieve compliance, especially to protect commissioners and elected officials. \nSPEAKER_05:  who may just not be aware of the responsibility. And there's a lot of people who are first-time commissioners and they don't know that if they don't know all the rules. \nSPEAKER_05:  So before the FPP comes after them, we like to try and make sure that \nSPEAKER_05:  They have been told that the rules are in place. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then \nSPEAKER_05:  But it is the FTPC jurisdictions. This is really their thing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  And maybe I think I'm gonna chime in just because of a recent change that was made to the salary resolution that has to do with compensation for commissions and advisory bodies. They were seeing, city clerk was seeing a lot of non-complications from people serving in commissions, committees, advisory bodies. And so one of the stipulations that was added, so hopefully to \nSPEAKER_01:  get more participation from commissioners and advisory body members was to add a stipulation that if you don't have a form 700 on file, you will not be getting any stipend. So that was something that was added to the salary resolution just to try to mediate this issue. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Just one time. That's a good. \nSPEAKER_05:  a good thing to note. \nSPEAKER_00:  And just to time it as well, just a quick note for anyone that wants to look at the audit commissioner Pollock did mention that there were some numbers there. So yeah, there are \nSPEAKER_00:  some data that's shared about the form 700 filers. \nSPEAKER_00:  from March as of March of 19. So there is some data there, I'll typically look at it for you guys would like to. \nSPEAKER_09:  Amy, I had a couple of additional questions. \nSPEAKER_09:  In the number that you provided for the number of employees, was that just the city employees to do that also include the Harvard Department? \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, so might I, I don't really know with any precision what the number of to the employees is that's probably more of a \nSPEAKER_05:  Becky question. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would think it would include Harvard Department. \nSPEAKER_01:  It does include Harvard Department. It includes not only full-time employees, but also includes part-time and non-career employees. So more of the full-time employees, I think we're more in the 50, 700. \nSPEAKER_01:  range. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  And then this is it. \nSPEAKER_09:  question that may be similar to Commissioner Dana Bigd, this is question. \nSPEAKER_09:  are there any cases in which so there's cases in which the FPPC has jurisdiction. \nSPEAKER_09:  Are there... \nSPEAKER_09:  any cases where it's the city's jurisdiction. \nSPEAKER_09:  but they will use the FPPC as an investigatory body or the FPPC, PPC holds itself out as the ability to do investigations. \nSPEAKER_09:  uh... because they mean it's a party doesn't have that ability \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, actually Commissioner Chattwelled, there are. If you're willing not in the situation in the \nSPEAKER_05:  financial disclosure situation. It's sort of in the second category that \nSPEAKER_05:  in the memo. \nSPEAKER_05:  the actual financial conflict of interest situation. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's one where it's sort of the reverse. If the city starts an investigation. \nSPEAKER_05:  the FTPC will sometimes request all of the information that the city has gathered. \nSPEAKER_05:  and pursue their own separate investigation. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the city came go ahead and sort of develop an investigation and \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, attempt to get compliance. \nSPEAKER_05:  with the means that it has. \nSPEAKER_05:  and the FPPC has a completely separate ability. \nSPEAKER_05:  to go after different state law violations. And they will... \nSPEAKER_05:  request the information from the city to help them. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  okay i get that i was but my question was more uh... \nSPEAKER_09:  are there cases in which the FPPC will come? \nSPEAKER_09:  put itself out there as a \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  Investigatory arm on behalf of the city. In other words, the city delegates its responsibility or \nSPEAKER_09:  or contracts for lack of a better term with the FPPC to do an investigation just because they don't have the resources to do it internally. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm not that I'm aware of. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  That would be an interesting thing if that could happen because they certainly have the tools. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  world \nSPEAKER_05:  So I don't want to take up too much of your time because I know you have a lot on your agenda today. But the next. \nSPEAKER_05:  category of violation is sort of a serious one. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's um \nSPEAKER_05:  Government Code Section 1090, which prohibits any member of a board or or council. \nSPEAKER_05:  from making a contract in their official. \nSPEAKER_05:  capacity in which they are financially interested. \nSPEAKER_05:  and FTPC takes this one very seriously. \nSPEAKER_05:  But this is also a state law violation that can be prosecuted by a number of different authorities. \nSPEAKER_05:  It can be. \nSPEAKER_05:  It can be prosecuted criminally or pursued to mo- \nSPEAKER_05:  Evol Welowee! \nSPEAKER_05:  The attorney general can prosecute it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  and it can \nSPEAKER_05:  lead to some pretty severe consequences. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  a person who's found to have violated it. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is one where as chairwipes \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll leave it to you earlier. \nSPEAKER_05:  If there is a \nSPEAKER_05:  If you go to the FTPC and request advice in advance about whether or not to proceed. \nSPEAKER_05:  They will sometimes stay. \nSPEAKER_05:  This transaction simply cannot occur. \nSPEAKER_05:  with you and your current role as whatever it is. \nSPEAKER_05:  City Council member or mayor or as \nSPEAKER_05:  whatever the position is. \nSPEAKER_05:  and there are a number of instances in the city where transactions have just not happened because. \nSPEAKER_05:  of that advice because the consequences are sort of severe that \nSPEAKER_05:  and risk it to great for the individual. \nSPEAKER_05:  So those don't come up very often, but those can be prosecuted by the district attorney. \nSPEAKER_05:  Those are sometimes those can be referred sometimes the city prosecutors office. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll gather some information and we'll become aware of the fact that it's a larger problem and we'll refer it to the district to turn the office. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  So those are ones that we... \nSPEAKER_05:  are. \nSPEAKER_05:  trying to be very careful about. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then finally we do have \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Municipal Code violations. \nSPEAKER_05:  as the audit noted and some of you have noticed as well. We don't have a huge number of municipal code sections that \nSPEAKER_05:  that really address the issue. There is a requirement in chapter 2.07 of municipal code to take an ethics pledge, which I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  You all did when you joined the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it's a pledge, it's an honor system thing to avoid conflict and interest and even the appearance of conflict and interest. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  There are also a number of sections in the Camp Long Beach Campaign Finance Reform Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  which are \nSPEAKER_05:  Director versions of some of the FTPC campaign finance requirements. \nSPEAKER_05:  Those were actually adopted by a load of the people. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think it was in the late 80s. \nSPEAKER_05:  as some of the strictest in the country and because they were adopted by a ruined people, they can only be changed by a vote of the people. \nSPEAKER_05:  So those very strict campaign finance. \nSPEAKER_05:  sections are still on the book and people are still working within them. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  And those are usually enforced by \nSPEAKER_05:  the city prosecutor's office and sometimes the city clerk's office will assist with. \nSPEAKER_05:  They do the record keeping on that campaign finance. \nSPEAKER_05:  issues and if there are issues with that the city attorney's office and the city prosecutor's office usually get involved in enforcement. \nSPEAKER_05:  Are there any questions on either of those two portions? \nSPEAKER_02:  I had one relating to the \nSPEAKER_05:  I have. \nSPEAKER_02:  the section 1090. I wasn't clear from your memo and from what you just said. Does \nSPEAKER_02:  If there is an individual, say there's an elected who has financial interest in some contracts is being considered. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does that if that person recuses himself, does that cure the problem for the city proceeding with that contract or? \nSPEAKER_02:  That is \nSPEAKER_05:  There's an excellent question. So there's this whole process that the FPPC and others, I guess, have devised over the years. \nSPEAKER_05:  And recue, though, generally works with the first category of violation with political format. \nSPEAKER_05:  issues. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if you fail to disclose something or and you have an interest. \nSPEAKER_05:  and you reduce yourself then generally, in other words, you announce that you have a conflict. \nSPEAKER_05:  You say why? \nSPEAKER_05:  and you leave the room and you don't participate in the vote. \nSPEAKER_05:  Generally speaking, that... \nSPEAKER_05:  that cures the problem and the rest of the legislative body can proceed with the action. \nSPEAKER_05:  with going to conjection 1090. \nSPEAKER_05:  If it's actually one of the board. \nSPEAKER_05:  board members or city council members that has the context. Say for example. \nSPEAKER_05:  a council person owned a piece of property and wanted to sell it to the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  That one is one where recusal wouldn't be sufficient and the entire group just couldn't proceed with the transaction. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that's a good question. And that is something that you see from time to time on the councilor genders that some council people will recuse themselves. Usually it's out of an abundance of caution. \nSPEAKER_05:  or in order to avoid the appearance of your propriety. \nSPEAKER_05:  But frequently, if well, if \nSPEAKER_05:  The issue comes up where there's a transaction that involved the council person in in a direct way like that. \nSPEAKER_05:  generally that. \nSPEAKER_05:  that transaction just doesn't end up happening. It ends up \nSPEAKER_05:  We try to remove it, get some further discussion on it, get some advice from the FTC before moving forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then this is JT just to follow up. My office got back to me and we have a little of 1,400 fileers. It's 638 employees and 386 board and commissioners. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Jamie. Amy. \nSPEAKER_09:  Is there any... \nSPEAKER_09:  So we have the initial. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think you said conflict event is disclosure. \nSPEAKER_09:  at the outset of engagement or hiring, correct? \nSPEAKER_09:  Right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Well. \nSPEAKER_09:  You might have referred to it. You might have referred. I'm not talking about the Ford 700. It's the other form that you refer to. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much. Have a great day. \nSPEAKER_09:  the plan. \nSPEAKER_09:  Oh, the ethics pledge, right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  Do we have that at the initial? \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, I'm sorry. That is done at the at hiring correct. \nSPEAKER_09:  uh... \nSPEAKER_05:  We're on. \nSPEAKER_05:  the \nSPEAKER_09:  We're in whichever applies. \nSPEAKER_09:  is there any other form i think i've asked this and i think i know but is there any other form of annual \nSPEAKER_09:  certification. \nSPEAKER_09:  to compliance with, you know. \nSPEAKER_09:  cities, lies, rules, regulations, policies, et cetera. \nSPEAKER_09:  and annual certification. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then you'll see. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  and poignant elected and poised elected and appointed \nSPEAKER_05:  Not that I know of other than the form 700 for the designated individuals, after why was it? \nSPEAKER_09:  And then that's more limited to complex of interest. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it doesn't apply to... \nSPEAKER_05:  other forms of most conduct they can't think of you mean at the moment but \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  You are. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  As far as this is Becky, as far as annual trainings, the city does require that managers who provide study staff and I believe electives do by annual training on \nSPEAKER_01:  on harassment. \nSPEAKER_01:  So they like sexual harassment and prevention. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is a training that happens, like I said, biannually, is conducted by human resources is documented. They have who's attended and who has not. And you know, department get, the departments get a list of who hasn't complied. And we have pretty good compliance on that. So we do have trainings that employees are required to attend. And that is one of them. I know it's not related to ethics, but we do have regular trainings for all staff. \nSPEAKER_08:  I had a quick question. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, \nSPEAKER_08:  Amy. \nSPEAKER_08:  the report. \nSPEAKER_08:  about the municipal code requirements. Is there anything in the municipal code that \nSPEAKER_08:  Apply to or can capture the \nSPEAKER_08:  conduct, not just the \nSPEAKER_08:  elected or appointed. \nSPEAKER_08:  official but \nSPEAKER_08:  For example, folks who might be \nSPEAKER_08:  running for office in the city. \nSPEAKER_08:  prior to being elected. \nSPEAKER_08:  such as \nSPEAKER_08:  you know. \nSPEAKER_08:  reporting what they raise or spend. \nSPEAKER_08:  more candidates committee. \nSPEAKER_08:  broader than a candidate himself or herself. Is there anything in the municipal code that? \nSPEAKER_08:  addresses. \nSPEAKER_08:  potential candidates. \nSPEAKER_08:  and not just them. \nSPEAKER_08:  formerly elected one. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, actually, in that same chapter 2, there are a number of requirements that have to do with \nSPEAKER_05:  with candidate. \nSPEAKER_05:  and campaign committees. \nSPEAKER_05:  a lot at the place where there's a lot of overlap with the FPPC. So frequently, if you get a complaint. \nSPEAKER_05:  There will be a complaint made to the FPPC and the complaint made to the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  but that is where there are a number of them. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  for now. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  I just had one other quick follow up question I was curious when JT said that \nSPEAKER_08:  came back with that data point about approximately \nSPEAKER_08:  1000 form 700 filers. \nSPEAKER_08:  After I read the report out of curiosity, I just quickly googled Form 700 in the city of Long Beach. I saw the sea. \nSPEAKER_08:  Did he post? \nSPEAKER_08:  historical archive of about five or six years worth of \nSPEAKER_08:  Form 700 filings from the various \nSPEAKER_08:  Council District Representative. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think this is the attorney. \nSPEAKER_08:  or the city prosecutor and the mayor. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I was curious if the city \nSPEAKER_08:  post any similar data for all the other. \nSPEAKER_08:  Form 700 filers included within that roughly 1000 person number of the JCM engines. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we don't have... Oh, sorry, go ahead and leave me. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  We don't. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Go ahead, you know, you go ahead, JT. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so I don't believe they're available online, but they are available upon request. \nSPEAKER_07:  just the elected officials, the ones that you are speaking of are available online, I believe. \nSPEAKER_02:  Aren't they all available through the FEPC though? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  All the best. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, and they're available through the through the city. It's if someone were to do a public records request, but that is public information. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just thinking, I mean, just quickly I was thinking. \nSPEAKER_02:  that the city website could just state that \nSPEAKER_02:  that all \nSPEAKER_02:  filings, 700 filings from City of Long Beach officials are available. \nSPEAKER_02:  on the FEPC website and \nSPEAKER_02:  wouldn't have to worry about. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, lo and media. \nSPEAKER_02:  putting them all up themselves and would. \nSPEAKER_02:  it would be a way of quickly becoming. \nSPEAKER_02:  transparent. \nSPEAKER_02:  by providing that link. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  I uh... \nSPEAKER_08:  what that was going to be uh uh \nSPEAKER_08:  question to post the group on a former fashion. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that's a really good recommendation. And I think as you are looking at what we do and what improvements can be made, that's definitely one of those things that could be recommended. I totally agree. I mean, just providing a link to where the information resides makes total sense. \nSPEAKER_02:  Better than getting a request, a request for public documents. Exactly. \nSPEAKER_02:  Amy, did you have anything further? Does anyone have further questions or comments about? \nSPEAKER_02:  her report. \nSPEAKER_05:  I have nothing for you. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, we know this does not require action, does it? \nSPEAKER_05:  I believe it requires motion to receive. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just receiving fire. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  right. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_02:  If there's no further discussion, then maybe we have a motion to receive and file this report. \nSPEAKER_02:  So moved. \nSPEAKER_02:  A second. \nSPEAKER_02:  second. \nSPEAKER_02:  Any further discussion? \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, please call the roll. \nSPEAKER_06:  Mr. Day Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Mr. Apollick. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  sir Shawwell \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Nice chair, Maralis.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. So we'll go to the third item, which is the report from the subcommittee on policy and problems. \nSPEAKER_04:  they add hot committee that we established at the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  I had a chance to listen to most of the meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I read the attachments and I'm so glad that this committee met even though the other committee couldn't meet. \nSPEAKER_04:  because I think this is moved just a big step forward in getting something done relating to ethics besides just appointing people all year long. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. So who wants to leave this? \nSPEAKER_04:  Leave the report for whatever. Bobby. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  by agreement of the ad hoc committee. I'll just get this discussion started. \nSPEAKER_06:  We started with a presentation by the city staff of a comprehensive action plan. \nSPEAKER_06:  spanning all of the commission's authorities. \nSPEAKER_06:  and although the ad hoc \nSPEAKER_06:  Committee scope of work doesn't encompass all of our authorities. We address the action plan structure. \nSPEAKER_06:  ahh \nSPEAKER_06:  and we'll continue to work on the structure of the action plan as well as \nSPEAKER_06:  feeling in. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  items that are within the scope of our assignment. We're taking the structure to tie the authorities of the commission to the standards of \nSPEAKER_06:  set forth in the external audit and move those to specific deliverables and the end result. \nSPEAKER_06:  will be an action plan with specific deliverables. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's our expectation that once we have the draft further matured. \nSPEAKER_06:  We will then provide it to the ad hoc committee on processes. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then have that that that ad hoc committee work on work on some of the commission authorities that are within their authority and then we would bring something to the full commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  Also, the ad hoc subcommittee began a discussion on the fundamental aspects of an ethics program and identified specific deliverables within the scope of the authority we were assigned by the commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we specifically discussed. \nSPEAKER_06:  approaches to a code of ethics for the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  We discussed resources that are available to guide the drafting process and plan to continue work towards a code of ethics, which would be one only one of the of the deliverables that would be within the scope of the comprehensive action plan, but it would be a first step. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, I \nSPEAKER_06:  I would like to say that I was very happy to get together. I thought working with Commissioner Maniki and \nSPEAKER_06:  and shot well on the action plan as well as \nSPEAKER_06:  talking about a potential code of ethics. I felt like it was a nice small group and we were able to make some real progress. \nSPEAKER_06:  I thought it worked well. \nSPEAKER_06:  I believe the meeting was a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, but \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh... \nSPEAKER_06:  given the issue that the other subcommittee had because it was a subcommittee of three while it was public, it was not binding on the entire commission. So we'd like to continue. \nSPEAKER_06:  with that approach and put together some draft materials that can then be considered. \nSPEAKER_06:  for some binding action by the larger group. \nSPEAKER_06:  and anybody want to add to that? \nSPEAKER_01:  I would only add that. \nSPEAKER_01:  We did talk about how we meet and \nSPEAKER_01:  I think this is on the agenda item three of the commissions agenda today in terms of. \nSPEAKER_01:  the efficiencies associated with us being able to get together and hammer out some things. \nSPEAKER_01:  which \nSPEAKER_01:  So we're going to want to have a little bit more discussion about that with item number three. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  more efficient. \nSPEAKER_01:  process that's left. \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, more efficient process. \nSPEAKER_06:  especially as we get into the drafting process. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there another or a revised action plan that's already \nSPEAKER_04:  in the work. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I do want to say \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  I think Julian, you created this in the first place, right? \nSPEAKER_04:  That's correct, sir. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I mean, it's, it is the wonderful start. \nSPEAKER_04:  and it's \nSPEAKER_04:  It's visual and organized. \nSPEAKER_04:  It really helped. \nSPEAKER_04:  It really, really helps a lot. So. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you for. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're doing this for us. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  But anyway, my question was whether or not. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's further work that's already been done on this that can be shared with the commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  as a whole at this time or no. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would say no. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Can we? \nSPEAKER_06:  First, I have to take a little responsibility. I was not that familiar with Google Docs. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I was actually editing the document. \nSPEAKER_06:  rather than showing comments. And so the document got edited by me. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the other two commissioners on the ad hoc subcommittee have just had a short and period of time to respond to the edits that I did. \nSPEAKER_06:  but also. \nSPEAKER_06:  um \nSPEAKER_06:  I think the whole structure needs more work before we present it to the \nSPEAKER_06:  to the I think all three of us agree. \nSPEAKER_06:  Meanwhile, this was a great start on it. It triggered a lot of conversation and provide. \nSPEAKER_06:  basis for us to actually think about tying the authorities all the way through. \nSPEAKER_06:  to deliverables. \nSPEAKER_06:  We need to represent that more clearly than \nSPEAKER_06:  what we have right now we probably need to add. So yeah, it's not ready for prime time yet. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would just add that I just want to thank Julian because I think he did an excellent job of pulling together the action plan that we have and so it's giving us something to work with. \nSPEAKER_06:  and sent out video after I edited the original document, sent out some videos so that I now know how to work in Google Docs. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  is a great job commission of polyp. Don't worry. \nSPEAKER_06:  I appreciate the videos I know. \nSPEAKER_06:  and Google Doc. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  person. \nSPEAKER_04:  is the next step going to include. \nSPEAKER_04:  tying the \nSPEAKER_04:  the the recommend the 11 standards of the \nSPEAKER_04:  Add it. \nSPEAKER_04:  two \nSPEAKER_04:  The I mean, sort of by number or whatever to the items in the \nSPEAKER_04:  in the plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  because I found myself as I listened to your discussion. \nSPEAKER_04:  wanting to do that and say, OK, is this one been covered? Is this one been covered? \nSPEAKER_04:  out. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't want to speak for everyone, but that's what I was trying to do. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  And one of the things I'm trying to also look to kind of go through and identify deliverables. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  or additional deliverables that may be in the audit. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then seeing, making sure that we've captured those, and then think about how we can best organize them. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will admit that I... \nSPEAKER_01:  uh... think that you know mission of paul up in commission or david if this and i have you know having had worked in this space probably have some preconceived notions \nSPEAKER_01:  and I'm really going to expect it. \nSPEAKER_01:  the rest of the \nSPEAKER_01:  commission to kind of. \nSPEAKER_01:  challenge some assumptions and really kind of think it, make sure that we're thinking it all the way through. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  Some of my comments actually are going to go into the next item on the agenda, but it's hard to talk about one without the other. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think, but one is, is that periodically as we do this, I think it would be useful. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  for us to test it again. \nSPEAKER_04:  what are probably real issues that are happening on the commissions or at the City Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  And a lot of this has to do with line drawing, but I think there are the kinds of things to think about. So if you're sitting on one of those entities and they have to pass on a \nSPEAKER_04:  on a contract. And I see this sort of hinted at, but what questions \nSPEAKER_04:  sure \nSPEAKER_04:  that. \nSPEAKER_04:  the commissioner or the \nSPEAKER_04:  council member of B asking themselves about that item to determine whether they have a conflict. And I see it embedded in some of these things. Like one of them would be, well, you know, have I gotten a gift from that person? \nSPEAKER_04:  have I, you know, has that lobbyist approached me? \nSPEAKER_04:  At least those are things. \nSPEAKER_04:  that I think about based on what I know about. \nSPEAKER_04:  contracting at the \nSPEAKER_04:  at the city. So \nSPEAKER_04:  and staff probably could come up with. \nSPEAKER_04:  a lot more examples for us of things. \nSPEAKER_04:  they know about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  or that it happened in the past. \nSPEAKER_04:  that would inform \nSPEAKER_04:  us and especially \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  If you haven't been on any other commissions or had a position with the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  help you, help everybody understand. \nSPEAKER_04:  what? \nSPEAKER_04:  what it is that the people that are doing that work. \nSPEAKER_04:  really have to. \nSPEAKER_04:  think about or what we want them to think about. So, \nSPEAKER_04:  So that it, so that what we end up with is something that that is. \nSPEAKER_04:  is useful. So \nSPEAKER_04:  Anyway, that's one that is one. \nSPEAKER_04:  thing that I think we should do. \nSPEAKER_04:  periodically as we go through this. \nSPEAKER_04:  Another question I had after listening to it and \nSPEAKER_04:  reviewing this is. \nSPEAKER_04:  this whole first category, which is \nSPEAKER_04:  outcome. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm. \nSPEAKER_04:  is where I think all the \nSPEAKER_04:  Isn't that where the values go, the issues that \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Manakee brought up the end of the last. \nSPEAKER_04:  the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  is your way. \nSPEAKER_04:  And one of the things I've thought about is that that's the values is one of the first things. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we all need to talk about. \nSPEAKER_04:  and whether we need to have \nSPEAKER_04:  a group. \nSPEAKER_04:  think about that in a small fashion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, and then \nSPEAKER_04:  come back perhaps as soon as the next meeting and \nSPEAKER_04:  lead the whole commission in a discussion of those things after having a chance to focus on it. Because it seems like \nSPEAKER_04:  that's going to inform everything. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ciao. \nSPEAKER_04:  Those are my comments concerns. \nSPEAKER_04:  from the \nSPEAKER_04:  from what I've. \nSPEAKER_04:  heard and seen so far. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm going to go back a little further. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Pollock had indicated that you were going to start working on a code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_03:  which is something I just drafted for the organization in the county that I'm working for, but it's very specific to that department. \nSPEAKER_03:  One of the documents that I was able to get my hands on. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's a very generic code of ethics from the County of San Diego that covers a broad perspective of a large government organization. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I think Amy, I should probably send it to JT to been sent out to everyone else so that I'm not in communication. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right. That's what I'm going to do. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so I'll do that a little later today. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, that'd be great. We looked at, we circulated Los Angeles and Santa Cruz because of Santa Clara, because those were two very different ones. \nSPEAKER_06:  But we definitely would need to look at others before we actually start drafting. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_01:  and share a wide \nSPEAKER_01:  terms of the values. I think that that is something that kind of goes into \nSPEAKER_01:  A lot of the work that this first committee is working on, so it might be good for that first committee to kind of start. \nSPEAKER_01:  getting something put together to then \nSPEAKER_01:  put out there for the full commission review. \nSPEAKER_04:  What is it is your plan in what you're working on right now to start filling out that? \nSPEAKER_01:  You see? \nSPEAKER_04:  the outcome column. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think the first plan is to kind of look at the approach. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the cable and see, okay, is this really something that's going to work? \nSPEAKER_01:  and then it would work for all the deliverables or all the work that we have as commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then number two. \nSPEAKER_01:  is for those that are within this first committees. \nSPEAKER_01:  We would go ahead and fill those in, including outcomes. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then the other committee or committees would do the same. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the areas that are within their. \nSPEAKER_01:  scope of the spot going. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that was kind of my question, knowing that with the next item, we have to. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have to. \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of have a discussion about how we want to set up the committee structure. \nSPEAKER_03:  is \nSPEAKER_03:  Do we? \nSPEAKER_03:  Is that something we can do now or do we kind of need to look and see what the work plan that this committee is working on. \nSPEAKER_03:  will look like and then we have a better idea of how to divvy up into \nSPEAKER_03:  At minimum, we're going to need three subgroups. \nSPEAKER_06:  well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that the final product. \nSPEAKER_06:  is going to be sufficiently different from what you see today. \nSPEAKER_06:  That. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh, eight. \nSPEAKER_06:  It doesn't make sense for that to dictate the \nSPEAKER_06:  the structure of the subcommittees. I think the subcommittees are ad hoc subcommittees that \nSPEAKER_06:  We talked about in the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  are a good division of responsibility for the next couple of months. \nSPEAKER_06:  regardless of how this action playing in \nSPEAKER_06:  evolves and then once we \nSPEAKER_06:  take the action plan through the ad hoc committee on policies and provide it to the ad hoc committee on processes. \nSPEAKER_06:  We may want to restructure yet again. \nSPEAKER_03:  But if we do that, thinking forward, if we leave ourselves with two committees, that means we have to omit. \nSPEAKER_03:  one of the members of this commission from a subgroup. \nSPEAKER_06:  Right, or was there a third subgroup that we had talked about but hadn't moved forward on? \nSPEAKER_06:  last time. But we were telling. \nSPEAKER_01:  The last meeting I had actually proposed three. \nSPEAKER_01:  I proposed one that was focused basically on \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  resources, I mean like tools, resources, engagement, which may include training. One that was focused on reporting and investigation, I think where we're kind of thinking process. And then one that was focused. \nSPEAKER_01:  on elected \nSPEAKER_01:  uh... and uh... lobbying laws \nSPEAKER_01:  because there is a specific aspect of our charter dealing with that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that's probably the discussion for the next agenda item. \nSPEAKER_01:  but I wanted to be visit that because then that would allow. \nSPEAKER_01:  3 and 2 and 2. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm wondering just for purposes of moving this meeting along if \nSPEAKER_04:  if we should. \nSPEAKER_04:  receive and file the report of the ad hoc committee and move on to the next. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  agenda item we can keep going going back to it. \nSPEAKER_04:  I mean, we can keep referring to it, but we receive and file it and then go forward with. \nSPEAKER_04:  with \nSPEAKER_04:  with \nSPEAKER_04:  how we think we should move forward from now. \nSPEAKER_04:  Knowing. \nSPEAKER_04:  some of the rules that we have have learned about how we have to structure ourselves and getting the getting the work done. \nSPEAKER_04:  because I think there may be some reorganization of tasks that we want that we're gonna be able to do. \nSPEAKER_04:  need to do here in order to get \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  things things done so. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  My understanding is that the report of the ad hoc subcommittee was going to be oral only. \nSPEAKER_06:  I mean, we did work on a written document, and I read largely from it, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, I didn't. \nSPEAKER_06:  I didn't think we were going to submit a written report. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, I don't and I think that's all we're doing is receiving and filing an oral report. I'm just following. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  agenda which would have us. \nSPEAKER_04:  receive and file the report. So \nSPEAKER_04:  The report has been given orally and \nSPEAKER_04:  That's what we would receive in file and move forward to. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  figuring out how we're going to work as a group. \nSPEAKER_04:  from here. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's good. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  I have a comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bobby JP Kimmy, I think it's fabulous what you guys did. It's hard to be the first to think about where you have to go and it's huge. Just looking at this and I'm \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sad to hear, but I'm also happy to hear that it's still working. It's going to continue to evolve. \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the things I'd like us to think about is how do we communicate to the ad hoc? Because I had some questions. I also know that it's still in process. So I want to not interrupt the process. But how will we cross pollinate and share ideas or give feedback? And I think that we may be a little further away from that yet. But if there is an informal way that we can more give feedback, I think that we should utilize that where we can. \nSPEAKER_02:  But thank you very much. I appreciate your hard work. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would actually on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I recommend I don't think it's \nSPEAKER_01:  on \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's allowed. \nSPEAKER_01:  for any individual member to \nSPEAKER_01:  talk with another member of the committee so in advance giving some of those ideas out there even before somebody has seen something or and they've seen this particular report too. \nSPEAKER_01:  So for example, there may be something associated with process where if I'm not on that committee, I have some ideas and I'd like to share it with somebody. And I think it might be good to go ahead and be able to share those in advance of that committee meeting or wouldn't that committee's meeting so that then it can be part of that process. \nSPEAKER_05:  So this is Amy. If I can jump in for a second, I think that... \nSPEAKER_05:  probably the most appropriate way to share information like that is in a commission meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the reason to have the subcommittees is to allow them to do work. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then I think the process would be for them to present as they have it this meeting today. \nSPEAKER_05:  a report on their progress or a written report or whatever they develop. \nSPEAKER_05:  and get input from the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  either \nSPEAKER_05:  either through written comments or by \nSPEAKER_05:  verbal observation. \nSPEAKER_05:  but generally speaking, \nSPEAKER_05:  If the commission is considering or deliberating on action that they're going to take, it needs to be taken in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  I hope that \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm not sure if that's exactly the subject that you were addressing that. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that the process is basically for the committee to meet and then report to the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it isn't good if we get sent in. \nSPEAKER_05:  I am. I am. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, I think I understand and I appreciate that feedback. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm thinking just on the draft that the ad hoc group presented to us orally. \nSPEAKER_02:  If I had the ability to send four or five sentences to contemplate for the next time you gather on what you've already discussed, if that can be done by an email to one of them. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm generally speaking no. It's I mean that the this is kind of a tricky way to do it. I mean to do documents and I think in the fifth item on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_05:  Julian may talk about a technology tool that he hopes will. \nSPEAKER_05:  assist in the process. But generally speaking, if the group wants to discuss it, then we just put it on the agenda for the entire group. \nSPEAKER_05:  So yeah, if you send an email to another member of the commission in advance of the committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, that's something that needs to be. \nSPEAKER_05:  That needs to be done publicly. \nSPEAKER_04:  I suggest we. \nSPEAKER_04:  talk about these things about tools and how we're going to communicate when we get to the next item, because I think \nSPEAKER_04:  what those rules are and what the restrictions are on us is going to shape. \nSPEAKER_04:  how we \nSPEAKER_04:  organize ourselves. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  because. \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  some of the efficiencies. \nSPEAKER_04:  that. \nSPEAKER_04:  We may be used to in \nSPEAKER_04:  you know private organizations or you know nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_04:  Those aren't necessarily available to us. \nSPEAKER_04:  here and it's frustrating. \nSPEAKER_04:  for sure. Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  But we need to understand that and then \nSPEAKER_04:  then figure out how we \nSPEAKER_04:  or how within those rules we get this work done. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Before we leave the item, if Commissioner DeBanondipu said seen some things that she wanted to give the subgroups. \nSPEAKER_03:  feedback on on the draft that's here. Now would be the time for her to do that. I don't want her to lose that opportunity if if you did see something. \nSPEAKER_03:  that you or if you were just doing an example when you had talked about seeing a couple of things that you wanted to give feedback on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks, Margot. I think that it was clear to me that they have more work to be done. And I... \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll be back. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll save those comments at that time. But it was... \nSPEAKER_02:  like to have a little bit of dialogue on... \nSPEAKER_02:  probably just some of the statements and how encompassing they are. \nSPEAKER_02:  but I'll hold for them when it's further work is done. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a couple more thoughts here, but I'll hold until we get to that agenda item where we can talk about it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, I have one other. \nSPEAKER_04:  I am that relates to the document itself for you to consider that I just found in my notes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  which is \nSPEAKER_04:  one of the \nSPEAKER_04:  items. \nSPEAKER_04:  besides referencing. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, making specific references to number one through 11 of the \nSPEAKER_04:  Harvey Rose on it. The other thing I would appreciate seeing \nSPEAKER_04:  kind of clearly delineated. \nSPEAKER_04:  if \nSPEAKER_04:  where it makes sense is \nSPEAKER_04:  where \nSPEAKER_04:  Amendment to the Code. \nSPEAKER_04:  are contemplated. \nSPEAKER_04:  to be \nSPEAKER_04:  to be necessary in order for the item to be completed or \nSPEAKER_04:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know carried out so. \nSPEAKER_04:  So maybe developing an education program doesn't have to be, you know, part of the code. It might require budget issues, but it doesn't have to be part of the code. \nSPEAKER_04:  but if we're going to \nSPEAKER_04:  if we want the code to include a statement of values or we want to rewrite the ethics pledge or \nSPEAKER_04:  create code conduct, you know, maybe that does need to become part of the municipal code. So \nSPEAKER_04:  And maybe all you can do is say that the item needs to be evaluated for those in that regard. But anyway, I think that's. \nSPEAKER_04:  that is it. \nSPEAKER_04:  an important thing to think about too as we work it out. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does anyone have any? \nSPEAKER_04:  additional comments. \nSPEAKER_04:  relating to their \nSPEAKER_04:  or a report that we have received from the ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  at this time. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, then we have a motion to receive and file the report from the ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_04:  Committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  on policy. \nSPEAKER_05:  So move. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye, second. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, we have a motion in a second. Would you take the call the vote please? \nSPEAKER_00:  And the seconder was Commissioner D. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I'll take the roll call vote Commissioner Deban like this. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Febler. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Mr. Apollick. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice Chair Marles. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  always. \nSPEAKER_10:  I \nSPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  So let's go to item number four, then, which is to reconsider the ad hoc committees established at the November 11. \nSPEAKER_10:  meeting, including the consideration of available technology tools and public reps. \nSPEAKER_10:  records matters. And obviously we've been \nSPEAKER_10:  talking about these. \nSPEAKER_10:  a little bit already. \nSPEAKER_10:  Maybe it. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm thinking that maybe it makes no sense for us to... \nSPEAKER_10:  make sure we understand what tools we have available to us. \nSPEAKER_10:  and what restrictions there are on us. And it sounds like \nSPEAKER_10:  that I had had committees already using Google DAX and \nSPEAKER_10:  and things like that. So. \nSPEAKER_10:  Is that something that staff wants to start by explaining to us? \nSPEAKER_10:  the technology tools and \nSPEAKER_10:  And perhaps also some of the restrictions that we need to always keep in mind. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi, Chair. Yeah, this is Joanne. So I can provide a brief overview of the Google box and how the app permission has been used at these past few days. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  So essentially, \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, the Google Doc is part of the Google suite of applications that Google provides and it's a free platform. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's really very similar to Microsoft Office, which, you know, I think \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, many people are currently using, you know, through their workplace right now. \nSPEAKER_00:  The cool thing about it is that it is free. It's also really good for online collaboration. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as I mentioned earlier. \nSPEAKER_00:  That community has kind of taken a crack at using that. \nSPEAKER_00:  with the draft action plan to begin the review work. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  So what is, I think, beneficial about the Google Doc is \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  that your Able Commissioners can review and include comments on one single version of the action plan. That way they can basically see. \nSPEAKER_00:  all of that, all of the collaborators work on one \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  one document itself. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that way there's really, it's good for version control, essentially it eliminates. \nSPEAKER_00:  different commissioners working on each their individual documents and just kind of allows everyone to work together. \nSPEAKER_00:  on the same document and provide feedback that way. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's also another good thing is that. \nSPEAKER_00:  It'll basically pop up a comment box. \nSPEAKER_00:  Once a Commissioner creates a comment. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then another commissioner or the commission themselves can actually reply. \nSPEAKER_00:  to that comment that has been made by another commissioner to kind of \nSPEAKER_00:  either provide feedbacks on the comments themselves or maybe suggest \nSPEAKER_00:  and edit on one of the suggestions that \nSPEAKER_00:  The um \nSPEAKER_00:  commission are made so it's also it's we've seen that it's been really good for for that kind of collaboration which is \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, really we're doing something very similar with that right now at this stage for the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_00:  I think it does a good job to visually at distinguishing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Who comments what because every commissioner by Google docs is assigned. \nSPEAKER_00:  color and \nSPEAKER_00:  So, you know, for example, Commissioner Manicus may be blue in the Commissioner shot will may be red. So you're able to really see people's inputs either, you know, on the side or in the document as well and visually see where where it came from. \nSPEAKER_00:  And they can also just express support for just a little example. Even I as a staff can say, you know, \nSPEAKER_00:  Good, you know, just comment, you know, I agree with this or a commission can do it as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  to someone's already commented suggestions. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I know this as commissioner, Pauli mentioned earlier, this is a new approach. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I think this is one that we found to be \nSPEAKER_00:  able to work well so far. \nSPEAKER_00:  these past few days. So I do want to thank you for that flexibility. \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, willingness to really adapt and just work with us as we... \nSPEAKER_00:  traits\u525b \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, find a good platform that works for everyone. \nSPEAKER_10:  is the \nSPEAKER_10:  Is the work that's being done? Is it? \nSPEAKER_10:  That's that's that's that's worked. It's a public record, right? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, that's my understanding. Amy, can you confirm that? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, so so that they're two. \nSPEAKER_08:  bodies of law that kind of cover this issue. One is the Brown Act that we've discussed previously. \nSPEAKER_08:  And the Brown Act says basically that anything that the Commission deliberate on needs to happen in public. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that's one constraint. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that's what... \nSPEAKER_08:  required us to reconsider the issue of the four persons. \nSPEAKER_08:  Bob Kennedy. \nSPEAKER_08:  because a four person. \nSPEAKER_08:  subcommittee is essentially a quorum of the commission. \nSPEAKER_08:  And so then anything, any action taken by that group is \nSPEAKER_08:  is the final action in the commission. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that was where that first. \nSPEAKER_08:  um, line came from. \nSPEAKER_08:  The second thing is that any writings that are prepared \nSPEAKER_08:  in a public meeting or public document. \nSPEAKER_08:  So the city gets, I would say thousands of public record records requests for a whole huge variety of things, for traffic, traffic like signal timing for \nSPEAKER_08:  payroll records, all kinds of different things. \nSPEAKER_08:  and they also occasionally get public records requests for documents related to conditions and forms. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I guess the thing to keep in mind is that as you're working through the process of \nSPEAKER_08:  commenting. \nSPEAKER_08:  or changing or redlining or whatever happens with the Google Doc. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, \nSPEAKER_08:  Those any of those comments are public documents and the public is able to see them and request copy. \nSPEAKER_08:  So it's one where circumspection and I know you are all very, very circumspecced. But it's... \nSPEAKER_08:  It's one of those things where it's important to keep in mind that as you're going through it, you're kind of, you know, it's kind of the \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  the maximum open door policy. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Pollock, I think you might be on mute. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  question. \nSPEAKER_03:  the ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_03:  The subcommittee of three could have met. \nSPEAKER_03:  in private, not in a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  If we chose... \nSPEAKER_03:  You based on discussion that we're having under this next agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  If we \nSPEAKER_03:  Choose to have non-fublic meetings of the ad hoc subcommittees. \nSPEAKER_03:  and more in the nature of a working group. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's an early draft. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're brainstorming and trying to get to a place where we have \nSPEAKER_03:  a work product that we are willing to present to the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Would the document, you know, in its various iterations in Google Docs not be a public record if it is the \nSPEAKER_03:  Output of a non-public meeting. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I think. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that's a policy decision for this board to make whether or not we choose to. \nSPEAKER_08:  an act of subcommittee public document public meeting. It's required to be under the brown act. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  But you can choose to miss that way. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I think you would have more flexibility with respect to preparation of documents if you did it that way. \nSPEAKER_08:  No, that that doesn't extend to sharing it with other members of the commission. So that if you ended up sharing it, sharing your draft, your third draft or whatever it is with the commission for their comments, those comments would be public, would be public because the entire commission was considering it. Does that make sense? \nSPEAKER_03:  It does or even if we wanted to show that draft to one other commissioner it then would become four \nSPEAKER_03:  and would have to be a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Follow. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  But as long as we're three, we can get to a point where we feel like we have something that's \nSPEAKER_03:  that we're proud to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  and it need not be public in its interim state until it gets to that point. \nSPEAKER_03:  but that's... \nSPEAKER_03:  back to the discussion of should these ad hoc sub committees. \nSPEAKER_03:  their meetings in public or as a working group non-public. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right. \nSPEAKER_07:  on the \nSPEAKER_07:  documents for themselves, there are a couple questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  First. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there a... \nSPEAKER_07:  What? \nSPEAKER_07:  We have \nSPEAKER_07:  or tools that the city staff use. \nSPEAKER_07:  So for example, I'm familiar with the Microsoft. \nSPEAKER_07:  office. \nSPEAKER_07:  365 suite of tools which contain \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  primarily or use one drive and sure point. \nSPEAKER_07:  But \nSPEAKER_07:  with tools to the city's gap years. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's what we use Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_00:  updates. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  is \nSPEAKER_07:  So I... \nSPEAKER_07:  appreciate and like. \nSPEAKER_07:  the there was no \nSPEAKER_07:  Google Doc. \nSPEAKER_07:  absent. \nSPEAKER_07:  other tools is \nSPEAKER_07:  it worked. \nSPEAKER_07:  it. \nSPEAKER_07:  clunky because you're actually working on the web. \nSPEAKER_07:  are supposed to download a little app onto a device. \nSPEAKER_07:  I've found that it's often, I'm familiar with the MSB65 suite. \nSPEAKER_07:  and wherever possible and that I actually choose to \nSPEAKER_07:  uh \nSPEAKER_07:  Download it, local copy temporary. \nSPEAKER_07:  work on it and it's downloading it's just something that occurs on the back end. It's nothing I actually do. \nSPEAKER_07:  uh... work on it and then close it goes right back up \nSPEAKER_07:  as opposed to actually working in the browser mode. Working in the browser mode is just \nSPEAKER_07:  difficulty with the latency impacts of just the internet. \nSPEAKER_07:  So my question was, is it possible? \nSPEAKER_07:  if the city is already using the MS suite. \nSPEAKER_07:  for \nSPEAKER_07:  us as the seven commissioners to also \nSPEAKER_07:  have access to those, the MS suite. \nSPEAKER_07:  to use. \nSPEAKER_07:  which might even be easier for the city staff. \nSPEAKER_07:  and administer in the process. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to show this. And so I do not have an answer right now, but what we can do is I can look into it and get back to you and see if that is something that we can. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  You've had something that is interesting. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I have a question to clarify that question. So are you asking us is where since the city uses office 365 that there be a share point maybe through cloud not to one of our drives because one of our drives you would not be able to have access because those are just for city employees. Are you staying to put something maybe like in the cloud, storing something in the cloud? \nSPEAKER_07:  So, by the nature of your body. \nSPEAKER_11:  We'll see you at your head. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, but by the nature of your question, I think. \nSPEAKER_07:  with SharePoint. \nSPEAKER_07:  you're able to provide access to a third party outside. \nSPEAKER_07:  to edit and \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we lost Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. I'm going to step away. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's good. \nSPEAKER_09:  He'll be back. \nSPEAKER_09:  But I think that goes to a bigger question that I've been thinking about Becky in the... \nSPEAKER_09:  We as a commissioner going to be doing a lot more work than other commissions traditionally do. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I know that there are aspects of the city's shared drive that we can't have access to. \nSPEAKER_09:  And maybe it's too big of an ask to ask for our own share drive. \nSPEAKER_09:  But if we could use something similar to what Commissioner Schottwell was talking about. \nSPEAKER_09:  and had something set up within the MS suite that we could use. I think as he said, it would work better for you and it would work better for us. You know, I think most commissions don't do a lot of drafting documents and putting things together. \nSPEAKER_09:  But that's going to be definitely something that we're going to be doing a lot of at least for the next year, maybe two years and probably in perpetuity. \nSPEAKER_09:  So maybe there are some administrative supports that can be set up for us that aren't there for other commissions. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, and just for my, for my own information and so that I can ask the right questions from technology and innovation and maybe a me of what's allowed or not allowed for advisory bodies. Just everybody in this commission have MS. \nSPEAKER_11:  Office 365. \nSPEAKER_11:  and their own computers. \nSPEAKER_11:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know if I do. I may be an outlier because I'm working on a Mac. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I do have the Microsoft office suite of \nSPEAKER_03:  tools and I just looked up on \nSPEAKER_03:  I just Googled the question of whether I could do Microsoft 365 on on a Mac and. \nSPEAKER_03:  The internet says yes, but \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll have to look into what I might be missing in the way of software. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, because if we all have, if we all have the Microsoft suite or 365, I believe we're able to use SharePoint. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, we can't sit. \nSPEAKER_11:  instead of Google Docs. \nSPEAKER_11:  And Julian, you are familiar with SharePoint correct because we were talking about the different tools for sharing documents and I think SharePoint was one of them. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, we have to discuss your point initially. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  All right, so we can check on our end and see what it is that we can do. Instead of using little talks and using sharp point and what needs to happen. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, so. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  from our end. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think there's another question to consider here too, and this is just because we're in this COVID time. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think the sentiment at our previous meeting when we set up the \nSPEAKER_10:  the two committees not knowing that the one with four wasn't going to work. \nSPEAKER_10:  was that \nSPEAKER_10:  As the ethics commission, we wanted to have our subcommittee meeting speak. \nSPEAKER_10:  Pablo. \nSPEAKER_10:  at least I thought that's... \nSPEAKER_10:  That's what I heard. \nSPEAKER_10:  and it turns out \nSPEAKER_10:  that to have a public meeting during this time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um, \nSPEAKER_10:  with everything shut down. \nSPEAKER_10:  requires that we use the. \nSPEAKER_10:  basically use this. \nSPEAKER_10:  the city chambers. It's equivalent to using the city chambers for \nSPEAKER_10:  a meeting of three because that's how we access the \nSPEAKER_10:  the cities. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  equipment. \nSPEAKER_10:  which allows it to be a \nSPEAKER_10:  a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  If it weren't for COVID, \nSPEAKER_10:  We could have these small committee meetings at the library, you know, in a conference room at City Hall or something like that. And it'd be noticed if someone from the public wanted to come or whatever they could. \nSPEAKER_10:  But we can't do that right now. So. \nSPEAKER_10:  So why don't you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Why did it? \nSPEAKER_10:  and from what? \nSPEAKER_10:  when we were first advised, I mean staff advised me and vice chair Morales that. \nSPEAKER_10:  wins problem with the committee of four. So what should we do? \nSPEAKER_10:  We learned that there really wasn't very much room on the city's calendar. \nSPEAKER_10:  for \nSPEAKER_10:  that \nSPEAKER_10:  subcommittee to \nSPEAKER_10:  there are many of three to meet. \nSPEAKER_10:  So it's going to be difficult. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think to find \nSPEAKER_10:  public time. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm \nSPEAKER_10:  for us to use if we want to do that. \nSPEAKER_10:  and it could slow down. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think what we do. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  because I think that, well, so I think we need to, we need \nSPEAKER_10:  in light of just the situation that we're in right now. \nSPEAKER_10:  with the virus. I think we have to think about \nSPEAKER_10:  how. \nSPEAKER_10:  whether or not we're going to \nSPEAKER_10:  require of ourselves that even our subcommittee meetings be public meetings. \nSPEAKER_10:  our subcommittees of three or less the public meetings. \nSPEAKER_10:  as we had hoped they might be. \nSPEAKER_09:  JT was going to go check the schedule and let us know what was available. Because I thought he had found a couple of days after our regular meeting where the subgroup could at least get together once a month. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so it looks like on the schedule for a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday after noon are generally available and that'd be around the same time frame that this meeting is held on other Wednesdays during the month. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  Well, so that gives us. \nSPEAKER_10:  you know, three slots, perhaps, in between meetings. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  for. \nSPEAKER_10:  the committees to meet publicly. \nSPEAKER_10:  if that's what we want to. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um, \nSPEAKER_10:  We want to do. I noticed. \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Chatwell is coming and going here on the screen. I don't know if he needs. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I emailed him the phone number to call in if he's having trouble with his computer. \nSPEAKER_10:  that<|mr|> shrimp. Can Ipack take off? That's all right Drink, drink some more then Normally and course As always well drink one more littleporpo and hopefully that fuels you. Anything other than that you can say about this that's why you may not take it home or rent anything to rent it near chops? Never mind if chap is written in the Holy come away Tolaries. Mmm? Mam \u0440\u0435\u0437heji Reat\ud398. Yep, This is great you couldn't see. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think if we have. \nSPEAKER_09:  the ability to meet publicly. I would hate for us to suspend the public portion of our discussions. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's because of COVID. \nSPEAKER_09:  there. \nSPEAKER_09:  From my perspective, there's so much distrust of what happens within the city government right now. \nSPEAKER_09:  that I think we need to just be as \nSPEAKER_09:  transparent as possible. \nSPEAKER_09:  because what we're going to be working on is going to be so overarching, even if nobody from the public comes. \nSPEAKER_09:  just giving them the ability to show up and listen. \nSPEAKER_09:  or then as you did go and listen to the meeting afterwards, I think is important. \nSPEAKER_03:  Evening aasma me na \u00e0 supernatural fried eggs, Ill\u043c\u0435za. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm not sure I feel strongly one way or the other. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, but \nSPEAKER_03:  \uc544... \nSPEAKER_03:  But what we're contemplating for these ad hoc subcommittees really is just brainstorming and drafting. \nSPEAKER_03:  sort of nuts and bolts work that is not setting policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  or actually even making any... \nSPEAKER_03:  because the results of that brainstorming and drafting \nSPEAKER_03:  will have to be brought to the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  in a full public meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So I mean, if people want to listen to me, they can listen to me, but. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's say we have the \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's say we have the even if the ad hoc subcommittee works in a group of three. \nSPEAKER_03:  What if I then called \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Maniki afterwards and said, hey you draft. \nSPEAKER_03:  section on \nSPEAKER_03:  conflict of interest in the Code of Conduct, I'll draft. \nSPEAKER_03:  the section on. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh... campaign contributions \nSPEAKER_03:  And then the two of us are sitting in our own homes. \nSPEAKER_03:  writing up sections may be talking to Julian. \nSPEAKER_03:  or asking him to write a second. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's just sort of nuts and bolts stuff that I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  mm-hmm. \nSPEAKER_03:  Marriott's public. \nSPEAKER_03:  comment or merits being in the public record. I guess I don't care if it is. I just don't know if we're sort of \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, creating this huge public record of \nSPEAKER_03:  on important stuff. \nSPEAKER_09:  So. \nSPEAKER_09:  There are going to be topics that we're going to be discussing in the subgroups that may be important to somebody who is a resident. \nSPEAKER_09:  and \nSPEAKER_09:  while we're not adopting anything at this time. \nSPEAKER_09:  We are drafting something. \nSPEAKER_09:  that they may want to have input into. \nSPEAKER_09:  and \nSPEAKER_09:  if we meet. \nSPEAKER_09:  not in a public manner. \nSPEAKER_09:  draft the document and then bring it back to this commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  Are we then going to adopt a policy that we don't adopt anything that something has to go through two readings. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  to give the public a chance to come in and comment. That's my only concern. \nSPEAKER_09:  is that \nSPEAKER_09:  If no, if the public has not had the opportunity to comment during \nSPEAKER_09:  the time when we're working on something. We have to make sure that we build into the process. \nSPEAKER_09:  the time for them to really review what we've done and give us their input. \nSPEAKER_09:  Otherwise, there will be somebody in the in the public that feels that we are working in a closet. \nSPEAKER_09:  trying to draft policies. \nSPEAKER_09:  that will impact a broader array of things and not seek the broader input from the community. \nSPEAKER_03:  I agree with that 100%. \nSPEAKER_03:  And even, you know, to be honest with you, I was a little put off when I saw that the materials from the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  staff today included that early draft of the action plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I was hoping nobody got to the last page of the packet. \nSPEAKER_03:  because \nSPEAKER_03:  because it is an early draft and I think all three commissioners based on what I then saw in Google Docs earlier today all three commissioners feel. \nSPEAKER_03:  like it's a wonderful architecture that we need to really \nSPEAKER_03:  work with and it needs a lot of more meat on the bones. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would that said if \nSPEAKER_03:  You guys had received that document a week ago or two weeks ago, I would have been more worried. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I even would think that when we have a document for review by this commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would want you guys to have weeks with it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Not days. \nSPEAKER_03:  and public when the agenda is posted with the documents. \nSPEAKER_03:  they become publicly available at that time, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  So I would definitely want the public and this commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  to have much more time with a document that we're ready to present for consideration. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I would be comfortable with the work groups. \nSPEAKER_09:  Because I want as much transparency as possible. \nSPEAKER_09:  if we all agree that once something comes back from a work group. \nSPEAKER_09:  And if we don't vote on it the first time, it has to go through at least two readings before we take action on it to adopt it. \nSPEAKER_09:  And that would give the public because the agenda is posted 72 hours in advance of our meeting. \nSPEAKER_09:  which is a little bit... \nSPEAKER_03:  She's a little bit of time. \nSPEAKER_03:  minimum of 72 hours. Could it be posted two weeks in advance? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  when we have something like that. I think we have to be careful because then we set a precedent. \nSPEAKER_09:  And if we do it for one one agenda, we're going to have to do it for everything. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so that's why I said. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yep, that's why I'm saying I think if we, it occurred me if I'm wrong Amy, but if we start posting everything two week, if we start posting one thing two weeks in advance, do we start setting a precedent that we would have to start posting everything two weeks in advance? \nSPEAKER_08:  Well, I think that certainly if you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I mean, I think it starts to get that way when you, you know, people come to expect that you're going to have your agenda out two weeks in advance and then we don't. The question is, well, you know, I didn't have enough time. \nSPEAKER_08:  So it also requires a fair amount of, you know, you'd have to have sort of have your agenda ready to stand. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that's another concern. \nSPEAKER_10:  Wow. \nSPEAKER_10:  I didn't hear your comment, I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_10:  The agenda also has to what? \nSPEAKER_08:  that the agenda must be ready to reach in advance. So the items need to be in the middle of the press to post it to reach in advance. We need to know what the commission's going to be talking about to reach in advance. \nSPEAKER_11:  I have a suggestion or something that we do, like for council meetings when there's an item in the works and we want the public to provide input. We do study sessions. So we do a study session and, you know, so you could do one or two study sessions on the draft plan before you adopted. So to give the public opportunity to provide feedback and also you commissioners provide feedback on the on the draft plan. And if the ad hoc committee needs to make changes, they can go back, meet again and make those changes and present it at the following meeting, either, you know, as a final for approval or another study session for additional feedback. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think that could work. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Mm-hmm. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that does go back to your point though, would be considered in two meetings. One, it would be considered. \nSPEAKER_03:  It would be circulated. Everyone would get it 72 hours in advance. And there'd be a study session then everyone would have potentially a month with it. If there was something that was \nSPEAKER_03:  time sensitive we could schedule a special meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  and approve it two weeks later rather than waiting a month. \nSPEAKER_03:  but generally a month. \nSPEAKER_03:  It is sufficient probably. Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, comments were shot while I don't know if you heard. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  the discussion, yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  had when i was talking so he had we had a power surge \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll tell you who's responsible for power search. \nSPEAKER_07:  which then took out our entire internet had to reboot my computer so I apologize. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm now just back on. \nSPEAKER_10:  It looked like there was a power. \nSPEAKER_07:  There was a power surge. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, talk to those people who are in charge of those power searches, would you? \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm gonna have a call at five o'clock. \nSPEAKER_09:  I look at this. Let's go back first before you brief him on that one, Bobby. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hey. \nSPEAKER_09:  Uh, Rebecca is going to look into whether we could do the Microsoft. \nSPEAKER_09:  Sweet. \nSPEAKER_09:  and get back to us on that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, and that may only work for people who have MSF. \nSPEAKER_07:  who have it on their systems anyway, I don't know. I know you know that there's a web version of that also, but that just allows for a less glitchy experience. \nSPEAKER_07:  because you're not on the browser and maybe more convenient for staff but \nSPEAKER_07:  If that doesn't work. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm happy with doing Google Docs. \nSPEAKER_07:  Sorry for the delay. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I need to do a little more research than I was able to do while you were talking on whether or not. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can get the Microsoft. \nSPEAKER_03:  365. \nSPEAKER_03:  to work on my Mac. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think I can, according to a quick internet search, but I have to look into it a little more. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm with you Bobby, I'm on a Mac. \nSPEAKER_12:  and a piece of Microsoft Mac products. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, I have the Microsoft products and I looked in my \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh... \nSPEAKER_03:  apps it doesn't say Microsoft 365 but i'm sure that's something I can. \nSPEAKER_03:  I will share with you whatever I find. \nSPEAKER_03:  And Commissioner Shaw, while I am familiar with SharePoint and have experience with it once I find out if I can actually get up to speed up. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mac. \nSPEAKER_03:  from my work days. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  The other item that I think you might have missed out on commissioner Shirewell has to do with \nSPEAKER_03:  the other idea. \nSPEAKER_10:  whether our meetings are public or not and if they're not, did you, did you hear that in the part about? \nSPEAKER_10:  whether we have \nSPEAKER_10:  We got into the post, you know, how far in advance the \nSPEAKER_10:  Agendas are posted and also \nSPEAKER_10:  using possible double having to having a study session and then \nSPEAKER_10:  a second meeting or having two readings of any items before there. \nSPEAKER_10:  adapted. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  and one of the \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  staff also advised us that. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  to the extent we want to have our \nSPEAKER_10:  our subcommittee meetings as public meetings. \nSPEAKER_10:  the best available, the time that's available on the city calendar while we're in this time of COVID and we need to use the city council chamber. \nSPEAKER_10:  technology. \nSPEAKER_10:  our Wednesday afternoon around this. \nSPEAKER_10:  this time, like the time that the ad hoc committee met. \nSPEAKER_10:  last week. So \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  So that's basically when we would be working. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  one of the things that I had. \nSPEAKER_10:  This is where again, this chicken and egg thing again. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  We may want to do things a certain way right now with reference to this plan that we're adopting or working on that's our main piece of work. \nSPEAKER_10:  And so some of these procedures that we're talking about have in two readings or a study session and a follow-up meeting. \nSPEAKER_10:  They may be fine for this. \nSPEAKER_10:  as the commission moves forward, there might be reason to. \nSPEAKER_10:  to change. \nSPEAKER_10:  to change these rules. But \nSPEAKER_10:  but we're not very far along yet. So. \nSPEAKER_10:  That's one of the things where I think we're going to have to. \nSPEAKER_10:  continue to be. \nSPEAKER_10:  be flexible in terms of \nSPEAKER_10:  of moving this forward. I'm wondering. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think we need to decide how we're going to work between. \nSPEAKER_10:  Now and our next meeting. \nSPEAKER_10:  And what we're going to do. \nSPEAKER_10:  and then perhaps if we're really talking about adapting \nSPEAKER_10:  some rules for ourselves. \nSPEAKER_10:  in terms of double meetings or whether meetings are going to be public or not. I'm wondering whether we should ask staff to \nSPEAKER_10:  Give us. \nSPEAKER_10:  recommendations about how those might. \nSPEAKER_10:  those have those might. \nSPEAKER_10:  Right. Look. \nSPEAKER_10:  because I don't think we're. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm not sure we can. \nSPEAKER_10:  get into all that we can think out. \nSPEAKER_10:  work through all those details in the time we have this afternoon. \nSPEAKER_10:  the staff. \nSPEAKER_10:  the staff want to. \nSPEAKER_10:  weigh in on that in terms of \nSPEAKER_10:  You're. \nSPEAKER_10:  knowledge of how \nSPEAKER_10:  of what kind of \nSPEAKER_10:  rules we would be passing for ourselves for half. \nSPEAKER_10:  Given how other commissions work. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, this thing maybe Julian and I could try to put the other kind of an overview of what some other commissions do and whether or not those \nSPEAKER_08:  Those approaches would work for you and we could put it on the agenda for the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  that that's \nSPEAKER_03:  Fine, but I don't want to wait till the next meeting before the ad hoc subcommittee gets together and makes more progress. \nSPEAKER_10:  No, and that's why I think we have to decide today what we're going to do between now and \nSPEAKER_10:  and January 13th, which is our next meeting. And \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_10:  And besides the question of how we're going to do it, what are we going to do? \nSPEAKER_10:  And are we going to create another subcommittee or two? \nSPEAKER_10:  to work on certain certain things or we're just going to leave this one to see what it can get done during that period of time is there something that \nSPEAKER_10:  that we want to. \nSPEAKER_10:  take out or \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  Oi. \nSPEAKER_10:  for. \nSPEAKER_10:  of what the work is for another subcommittee to work on. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  And just to get the ball rolling here, I'm going to suggest that \nSPEAKER_10:  that maybe a discussion on values in a small group would be a valuable, would be a valuable exercise for another small group to have or for two small groups to have. \nSPEAKER_10:  because that would be... \nSPEAKER_10:  Um, that would allow. \nSPEAKER_10:  the other four people to um \nSPEAKER_10:  participate. \nSPEAKER_11:  This is Becky. \nSPEAKER_11:  So just a comment and possibly a suggestion. So we, the at-home committee is working on a draft plan. That draft plan has five goals, I believe. And so maybe taking a look at those five goals and see if you want to divvy up those goals into two additional subcommittees. And, um, \nSPEAKER_11:  The thing about working as an hot committee. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I don't know public meeting gives you the opportunity to really take in and get work done because if you're dependent on, you know, the schedule, the schedule of the chambers, the availability that really limits you to maybe one time a month to really get together and have those conversations on on editing and further crafting the plan. I think if you work behind the scenes as the work groups and then, you know, each of you presents the section or sections that you're working off of at the next council meeting and maybe continue to pull, you know, just. \nSPEAKER_11:  cohesively put that plan together. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  You may get more work done that way than if you're waiting for availability of the chamber. And you know, that's just for one committee. There's only the Wednesday. How about if we do two or three? I'm just thinking you're really eager. You have momentum right now to get work done. And doing the drafts behind the scenes as the work group would probably make a little bit more sense to me. \nSPEAKER_10:  there. \nSPEAKER_10:  So your suggestion is we take the five goals, divide those up. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  You have. \nSPEAKER_09:  out. \nSPEAKER_10:  you give its \nSPEAKER_10:  work on those not in a public setting. \nSPEAKER_10:  And if I take that and combine it with the earlier discussion, those ad hoc meetings would not be public. \nSPEAKER_10:  But this all would come back to a study session. \nSPEAKER_10:  at the January meeting. No action plan would be adopted at that time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Maybe we would get it done in February, but in January, presumably based on what we have, we would then determine. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chairman. \nSPEAKER_10:  How to \nSPEAKER_10:  how we'll move forward and when based on what we've worked on in the interim, something like that. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, something like that. So each ad hoc committee would present the sections that they're working on from the draft plan. And you could either have a study session in January or at the January meeting, everybody presents their sections. And then in February, you can have one or two study sessions that then it's a more cohesive plan that everybody has had an opportunity. Everybody meaning all of the commissioners have had an opportunity to look at the various sections that the committee's subcommittees are working on. \nSPEAKER_11:  And then in February, present something that has had buy in by everybody and put it for public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I'd like to make a comment or. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Make sure to pop like if you want to go first. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was just going to say I like the process we're talking about. My only concern is \nSPEAKER_03:  that. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're actually talking about changing the column headings. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that there will be deliverables and interim deliverables and subsequent deliverables and metrics and milestones and \nSPEAKER_03:  So \nSPEAKER_03:  We can't divide up the tasks until we give everybody the right headings. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  So this is Amy Commissioner Pollock. One suggestion that I was thinking about when you were discussing it earlier is that \nSPEAKER_08:  It might make some sense to let your subcommittee kind of develop the plan a little bit. \nSPEAKER_08:  And at that point, create the new subcommittees. In other words, we can see what categories you have. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then create the subcommittee instead of creating them now without knowing. \nSPEAKER_08:  how you're going to fill them. \nSPEAKER_11:  That makes a lot of sense, Amy. \nSPEAKER_10:  Is it that are you saying that you're that they're no longer will be these five goals. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, there will be goals. \nSPEAKER_03:  or they might not be called goals. I would call it responsibilities. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Those are responsibilities. \nSPEAKER_02:  Those are responsibilities. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right. Challenge of the document as it is currently is that the goals are responsibilities in fact. And so. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hello! \nSPEAKER_02:  how I needed to digest all of the information. It's still the same information that's in the current plan, although \nSPEAKER_02:  For me, it's structured with \nSPEAKER_02:  The standards first and then the pre-work that that probably needs to be done first. \nSPEAKER_02:  and then some like sub goals or like some deliverables are connected to the \nSPEAKER_02:  to those and based on the recommendations made. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, official document. \nSPEAKER_02:  So it just shifts and then what's termed as goals in the current plan actually are like the responsibilities or duties of ethics commission. And so I have another column that outlines. \nSPEAKER_02:  with each deliverable which you know which ones actually meet those it can be all one two five or like one two three \nSPEAKER_02:  And so that way it's. \nSPEAKER_02:  It doesn't necessarily center the duties of ethics commission as primary goals, but it goes based on the recommendations and the standards about it. So I think once we I think that was what commissioner of policy was actually doing was trying to insert. \nSPEAKER_02:  that into the actual existing documents. So it flowed in that particular way. And so once we just clean up the, I think the structure of the document, the natural workflows are going to say merge and we'll get to see like what the, what the buckets of work will look like. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I appreciate that, keys. \nSPEAKER_09:  recommendation and comment, but I think there's a continuity of effort to having the same three people do the work plan. \nSPEAKER_09:  rather than to divvy it up amongst all of us. \nSPEAKER_10:  Well, let me ask, let me ask the question another way. \nSPEAKER_10:  from the committee, position of those of you who are in that committee. \nSPEAKER_10:  Is there anything in particular that you think the rest of us should focus on while you are? \nSPEAKER_10:  taking that information and organizing it, you know, organizing the plan. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do believe that you could have a group take on, like as you suggested earlier, start to work on the values of the city that we would like to have adopted for the city. That could be one. \nSPEAKER_07:  I put out there at the last meeting or the meeting before last, kind of those three different buckets of work that as I saw it. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  They were... \nSPEAKER_07:  kind of the tools and resources we provide to the city. \nSPEAKER_07:  uh... can policies a code things on that line \nSPEAKER_07:  that would also include training. \nSPEAKER_07:  uh... communications a second bucket of work would be the reporting in investigation process uh... to the extent that the city does any of its own investigation so really how do we pull together all the reporting \nSPEAKER_07:  that is currently allowed and then how do you also provide an anonymous reporting option, but ensuring that no matter where the information is coming in, it's all being tracked in one central system. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then what do you do for the investigations of those? I see that as a second bucket of work. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then a third potential bucket. \nSPEAKER_07:  would be kind of dealing with \nSPEAKER_07:  uh... you know basically the lobbying laws which is a \nSPEAKER_07:  a huge thing that was in the city charter associated with us and to begin with our group with our work. \nSPEAKER_00:  in the beginning. \nSPEAKER_07:  and to begin thinking about those. \nSPEAKER_07:  It could be that we could take some of those. \nSPEAKER_07:  and begin to also work. \nSPEAKER_07:  those with other subcommittee members until \nSPEAKER_07:  We kind of come back together, reconstitute everything, just so we don't lose time. \nSPEAKER_07:  If we're not able to kind of come up with what those work streams are today, but we could at least \nSPEAKER_07:  identify that we know we're going to have work and need to do some thinking in these particular areas, therefore with \nSPEAKER_07:  Go ahead and get started there. \nSPEAKER_10:  What are the other members of the subcommittee think about? \nSPEAKER_10:  what the others should do. \nSPEAKER_10:  or could do in the interim, if anything, to be useful. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think even Dr. Kodov conduct. \nSPEAKER_02:  two could be part of that. \nSPEAKER_02:  that work that there's something that it does. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can everybody hear me? This is Julian. \nSPEAKER_03:  I hear you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, great, thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  One of the things that I was... \nSPEAKER_00:  I was looking at as, you know, combining the action plan and the recommendations is... \nSPEAKER_00:  The author also really suggests and spends time explaining how it's very important as a fundamental. \nSPEAKER_00:  action to take which is to define or you know what ethics means to the commission and to the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, that's kind of got some philosophical aspects to it, but it really is fundamental in \nSPEAKER_00:  beginning to guide. I think you're working moving forward on \nSPEAKER_00:  And this kind of goes along what Chair, you mentioned with the values piece. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, I'll be up on this fight what the \nSPEAKER_00:  action plan may look like or the modifications, I think, moving on kind of these two pieces is something that, you know, will not sway regardless of \nSPEAKER_00:  the action plan itself could be just such fundamental pieces. So that could also \nSPEAKER_00:  be, you know, something that is of work. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think. \nSPEAKER_00:  as well. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  I have to say for my um \nSPEAKER_10:  Lot. \nSPEAKER_10:  feel the saffical point or something. \nSPEAKER_10:  I feel like. \nSPEAKER_10:  focusing on values and what should be in the code of ethics or the \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  or ethics definition. \nSPEAKER_10:  where we should be. \nSPEAKER_10:  starting. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think some of the things about investigation and \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  and lobbying and things like that. I feel like those are really those are technical and they're really important but \nSPEAKER_10:  I feel like. \nSPEAKER_10:  Those that come a little bit. \nSPEAKER_10:  later when we can really roll up our sleeves. \nSPEAKER_10:  So \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_10:  I mean, I for one, I'm interested in working on. \nSPEAKER_10:  on either values or an ethics definition or one of those things. I don't know who else might of the others would be interested in doing that. And I don't know if there's a way to sort of divvy up that big. \nSPEAKER_10:  general. \nSPEAKER_10:  bucket or even have two groups sort of talk about it independently just because it's worthwhile. \nSPEAKER_10:  Tim. \nSPEAKER_10:  to stimulate your thinking by having \nSPEAKER_10:  You know? \nSPEAKER_10:  talking about it with someone else. \nSPEAKER_09:  But I think we can divvy those up into two groups. And those are some kind of quick bites we could get through. \nSPEAKER_09:  while the other group is working on our action plan. \nSPEAKER_09:  and that we can kind of reach bigger things at that time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so how would you, do you have a suggestion about how we divide up, divide it up? \nSPEAKER_10:  between \nSPEAKER_10:  I've got, I mean, I've got three things I've written down values. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm saying code of ethics, but \nSPEAKER_10:  and ethics definition. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I would say that the ethics definition and the code of ethics would go hand in hand. You could have a separate group on values. I've actually been involved in efforts where those have actually happened on a completely separate track. So I do think it can be done on a completely, you could do values in one group. \nSPEAKER_07:  and ethics, ethics definition, ethics code, ethics definition of what is another group. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have four members remaining and we could just divide up into two. \nSPEAKER_07:  two-person subcommittees. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, so. \nSPEAKER_10:  So I'm just trying to bring this all together so that we can. \nSPEAKER_10:  Maybe um \nSPEAKER_10:  You know, set ourselves a few tasks between now and January 13th. \nSPEAKER_10:  So what we would be doing is we would be continuing with the \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  the existing ad hoc committee and the development of \nSPEAKER_10:  the action plan. \nSPEAKER_10:  we would be \nSPEAKER_10:  establishing two additional ad hack committees. \nSPEAKER_10:  One to do code of ethics and ethics definition in one to do overall. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  values. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  these groups could meet or would meet. \nSPEAKER_10:  without a public. \nSPEAKER_10:  without a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_10:  but would then bring their reports to the meeting on the 13th. \nSPEAKER_10:  and obviously \nSPEAKER_10:  They can't take any action nor will any action on their work be taken at the January 13th meeting. It would it would be incorporated into \nSPEAKER_10:  future. \nSPEAKER_10:  actions by the commission. \nSPEAKER_10:  yet to be determined. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ah, that sounds like a good plan. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right. Well, \nSPEAKER_10:  and then meanwhile. \nSPEAKER_10:  staff is going to be working on figuring out some of the technological or the technologies that would be best for us to work on. But \nSPEAKER_10:  just so I understand in these small committees we set up. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  if there are none public meetings. \nSPEAKER_10:  The commissioners themselves can decide. \nSPEAKER_10:  when they want to meet. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  they can exchange documents in whatever format they want. \nSPEAKER_10:  but but \nSPEAKER_10:  They \nSPEAKER_10:  but we all have to know that whatever it is we're exchanging, whatever emails we're sending between ourselves. \nSPEAKER_10:  to do that work is all going to be. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Ha ha. \nSPEAKER_10:  potentially, you know, public record and potentially \nSPEAKER_10:  discoverable or producible in response to the public. \nSPEAKER_10:  with requests for public documents. \nSPEAKER_10:  have I stated the rules that would apply to us correctly? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, I think you have. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think that would work. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, and I just want to say I think because we're in such an embryonic stage here. \nSPEAKER_10:  And we don't know. \nSPEAKER_10:  what we are evolving into at this point. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think we all need to be. \nSPEAKER_10:  We all need to remember to be flexible. We don't have \nSPEAKER_10:  precedent to guide us. I mean, we can look at other commissions, but \nSPEAKER_10:  here and elsewhere, but I think we're going to get the most done if we stay. \nSPEAKER_10:  flexible and we'll see where we are in January and if that means \nSPEAKER_10:  We do the ad hack committees. \nSPEAKER_10:  in terms of their subject matter or their membership. \nSPEAKER_10:  You know, so I don't think. \nSPEAKER_10:  We don't have any standing committees. These are committees we're establishing for now until January 13th. \nSPEAKER_10:  And, and then we'll \nSPEAKER_10:  We'll go from there. \nSPEAKER_09:  Well I am! \nSPEAKER_09:  So speaking of which of the two new ad hoc committees are you most interested in being on? \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Oh, whichever one you're not on, I'll take. And then. \nSPEAKER_09:  We just need commissioners to do some fee or to pick. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, I will go with values. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you for, is that all right with you? \nSPEAKER_10:  Bye, sir. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  are revocating preference then, me and commissioner to Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_05:  Please. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd be interested in the values. \nSPEAKER_05:  and maybe it will. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  If that if that works. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Margo, you have me again. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  code the code of conduct sounds great. \nSPEAKER_10:  We're back. \nSPEAKER_09:  becoming a team. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, you were you were you had the same districts for the review, right? Okay, correct. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, then I'm going to move this along. I'm going to try to state emotion that I'm going to ask one of you to amend or adapt or move. \nSPEAKER_10:  which would be that \nSPEAKER_10:  that we will. \nSPEAKER_10:  but we will. \nSPEAKER_10:  establish three ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right. \nSPEAKER_10:  now to \nSPEAKER_10:  work over the next. \nSPEAKER_10:  next month before our next meeting the existing ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_10:  working on the action plan. \nSPEAKER_10:  will \nSPEAKER_10:  will proceed. \nSPEAKER_10:  a committee on values composed of myself and Commissioner Fiedler. \nSPEAKER_10:  will. \nSPEAKER_10:  I \nSPEAKER_10:  will proceed and a third ad hoc committee composed of Vice Chair Morales and Commissioner Debanne De Doe. \nSPEAKER_10:  will. \nSPEAKER_10:  go forward on the topics of the coded ethics. \nSPEAKER_10:  These committees will not need to be \nSPEAKER_10:  publicly. \nSPEAKER_10:  they will meet as ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um, \nSPEAKER_10:  And it is understood that there that their work. \nSPEAKER_10:  in their exchanges will, you know, are essentially public. \nSPEAKER_10:  public documents. \nSPEAKER_10:  and subject to review. \nSPEAKER_10:  So. \nSPEAKER_10:  My suggestion is that we have a motion to establish those three ad hoc committees to move forward with the work that's been assigned to them between now and January and our next meeting in January. \nSPEAKER_10:  Some move. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so we have a motion and a second. Is there any further discussion on this item? \nSPEAKER_03:  The only discussion I would have is so I had shared some code of conduct, some codes of conduct. \nSPEAKER_03:  with the members of the ad hoc subcommittee I was working on, which I'd like to \nSPEAKER_03:  make available to the subcommittee that's working on the code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just need to know how to do that in compliance with the rules. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can pass that along with a vice-chair Morales' document. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's great. Thanks. And \nSPEAKER_03:  And also for their information, there is a \nSPEAKER_03:  an institute of local governments that's got a lot of good materials to. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um, yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  to that point and with reference to the request that we made from staff, which I don't know that we need to have a motion on but \nSPEAKER_10:  I would like suggestions to as to how we share. \nSPEAKER_10:  resources because a lot of this sharing is just \nSPEAKER_10:  references to public resources that are out there. \nSPEAKER_10:  But if we can compile a library for ourselves of references to use. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  They aren't secretly just need to figure out a way to \nSPEAKER_10:  to do it and perhaps be notified that \nSPEAKER_10:  These items now are in this. \nSPEAKER_10:  pile of resources that we can go look at. \nSPEAKER_03:  of that being great to have. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think one thing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  We can do is probably just attach it on, I can create another section under the resources webpage on the website and then every time I update it, I can just send out an email saying additional documents have been added and then it's also available to the public because we have been like the ones you sent to us, Commissioner Pollock, we added that as an attachment of handouts to the last meetings item. \nSPEAKER_01:  That way then, it's just out in the public and able to be accessed by all of you and everyone else. \nSPEAKER_10:  So are those things now, and I mean, I haven't looked at the resources on the website. So is that. \nSPEAKER_10:  We should now go look at those if we want to see what the things you're speaking of. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  It's a part of the file ID for the last meeting. So each item has its own file ID and you can click the link on the agenda online to look at the attachments, like the staff reports and everything that we've been sending you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so it's not on the left. \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's not a problem. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  It's on the website. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  on the website. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  to find them. It would be good to put those kinds of things. \nSPEAKER_10:  in a separate place called resources, because otherwise we're going to have to remember that all that was attached to the meeting from, you know, November. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and that's kind of, I think what we're planning if you want to move forward with this is to add that on to the ethics commission website. And then we have all those different resources we can create another section and I can work with Julian on that. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  and then we have all those. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, that would be great. Maybe we could have a report about. \nSPEAKER_10:  what you're. \nSPEAKER_10:  plans are or what has been done on that. \nSPEAKER_10:  at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, we can follow up with that and all of the \nSPEAKER_01:  what we come up with for the technology and everything for sharing. \nSPEAKER_10:  Great, okay, perfect. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, is there any other discussion on the motion that's pending? \nSPEAKER_10:  Christopher DiB\u00e9n\u79e6 \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. I was just curious. Is there a listing of our contact information that we can easily exchange or? \nSPEAKER_12:  That would be really helpful, I think. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I think I sent down the letter. \nSPEAKER_12:  I think I sent out the... Because I played around... \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I sent out a contact info list with everyone's contact on it previously. I can send an updated version with Julian's contact info as well. \nSPEAKER_10:  That would be great. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  to be great. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Any other questions on this item before we vote on the motion that's pending. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  Will you call the role of the motion please? \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_12:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Fiebler. \nSPEAKER_12:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner of Polley. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hi.
