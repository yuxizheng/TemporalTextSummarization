        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  of an existing detach one car garage in a construction of a new detach structure consisting of 506 square feet. Two car garage, a 246 square foot, rampage room, and a 912 square foot ADU or accessory dwelling unit above the garage. \nSPEAKER_04:  on a contributing property located at 3559 Brayton Avenue within the R1 and zoning district within the California Heights Historical District number five. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. This is Alejandro Sanzitolo, this advanced planning officer. Miguel Sama-Yoyal, the project planner, will give the staff report and presentation on this item. \nSPEAKER_11:  Good evening, Chair, Vice Chair and fellow commissioners. Before you, is a major certificate of appropriateness, application in the California Heights Historic District. \nSPEAKER_11:  The subject property is located on the west side of Brayton Avenue between East 36th Street to the north and Wardlow Road to the south within the one R1N zoning district, single family residential standard lots with the land use place side designation of founders and contemporary neighborhood. The subject property total is approximately 6,380 square feet, 50 feet by 127.6 feet deep. The existing home located at the front is a contributing structure in the California Heights Historic District. Based on building permits, the house was built in 1931. The single story residential dwelling and detached garage both rectangular and shape. \nSPEAKER_11:  The single story house was designed in a Spanish colonial revival architectural style and has a height up to the peak of 17 feet. The house and garage features Stucco body and with a white color and blue trim. The house itself has a side facing gable roof system with two smaller street facing gables. Each gable features a triple clay attic vent just above the windows. \nSPEAKER_11:  the garage has a flat roof system with a parapet and tile coping with the door for one car and one door. \nSPEAKER_11:  The house in garage are painted in a cream body color with blue trim and terracotta style roof shingles. \nSPEAKER_11:  The applicant is proposing to construct a 506 square foot to attach to car garage with a 246 square foot rumpus room, a 200 square foot patio cover and conjunction with a 912 square foot accessory dwelling unit above the garage and rumpus room at the rear of the lot. The proposed project requires the approval of the CHC because the proposed addition creates a second story that would be visible from the public rideway. To be granted approval, the project must comply with the secretary of the interior standards and meet the criteria for a certificate of appropriateness. The proposed ZDU is permitted by right under city zoning ordinance and the R1N zoning of the property as well as by state law. \nSPEAKER_11:  subject to compliance with unit size requirements and conformance with the design guidelines and other ADU development standards. As it pertains to the ADU in particular, the CHC's purview is limited to design review for consistency with the historic district. \nSPEAKER_11:  The existing one-story residential building is shown in purple, with the existing garage located at the rear of the property shown in red. An existing patio cover and structure in orange will be removed. \nSPEAKER_11:  Rose garage is shown in yellow, the Rumpest Room in Green, patio cover in orange, and the ADU above in blue. \nSPEAKER_11:  for reference the existing garage is shown in orange. Sorry, I apologize. The building will be set back for feet from the northern and southern property lines, and the garage will comply with the minimum turning radius for a garage, and the project is rectangular in shape with the patio projecting below. \nSPEAKER_11:  This is the Fippos first floor plan for the garage with Rumpus room with a half bathroom beside and a patio cover projecting. \nSPEAKER_11:  The second story floor plan shows the EDU which includes two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, with a balcony that can be accessed from both bedrooms. \nSPEAKER_11:  With these elevations, the EDU is designed in a Spanish colonial revival architectural style. In the Eastern elevation, we can see the EDU will have a flat roof system with a parapet and terra-con of tile coping. Access will be provided on the northern side via enclosed stairs, and the balcony can be seen on the right side with the railing. \nSPEAKER_11:  The proposed DADU is proposed to be 22 feet in height as measured to the peak of the roof, whereas the existing house located to the front is 17 feet. On the north elevation we can see the patio cover to the left and the railings on the second floor of the balcony. The DADU can't lever over the garage towards the alley approach, seemingly 3 feet 9 inches. \nSPEAKER_11:  On the alley facing west elevation, we can see the garage door. I do apologize that there is an oversight. The application is not for a three car garage, but for a two car garage. That's so it's not accurately depicted. Wall sconces will be installed to provide light. Along with the cantal evred portion of the ADU exposed beams will be placed. The proposed project complains with the Spanish Colonial Revival Style Guide, residential development standards, and the Long Beach Municipal Code in California Heights historic district ordinance. \nSPEAKER_11:  Here are some renderings of the proposed project. It should be noted that there is a two-story building directly south of the project site and is closer to the street. And there are other two-story structures along this stretch of Brayton Avenue. Furthermore, two-story structures are not particularly uncommon in this part of the district. \nSPEAKER_11:  Here's another rendering to the north. \nSPEAKER_11:  into the west. Alley facing. \nSPEAKER_11:  and the Southern elevation. \nSPEAKER_11:  As designed, the proposed project complies with the zoning code, the California Heights Historic District Ordnance, Secretary of the Interior Standards, the Spanish Colonial Revival Style Guide, and the certificate for appropriateness findings. \nSPEAKER_11:  As designed, the proposed garage from Pastroom patio cover and two store ADU will have minimal visual impacts when viewed from the street along Brayton Avenue. The proposed project will be consistent and in compliance with the city's residential development standards for the R1N zoning district. As mentioned before, zoning code, California Heights is store district ordinance, Secretary of the Interior Standards, Spanish Colonial Revival Style Guide, and certificate of appropriateness findings. \nSPEAKER_11:  Intermediator 8, as it pertains to the EDU, the CHE's purview is limited to design review for consistency with historic district standards, pursuing a section 2.63080 of the City of Long Beach Municipal Code. \nSPEAKER_11:  Based on the information provided, all required findings can be made in the affirmative. \nSPEAKER_11:  With the aforementioned findings, staff recommends approval of the certificate of appropriateness request subject to the conditions of approval. \nSPEAKER_11:  This concludes staff's presentation. \nSPEAKER_11:  the applicant and property owner are available for comment. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you, Deff. \nSPEAKER_04:  commissioners, is there any discussion on this item? \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Pisa. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you, Commissioner McGon. So I had some questions on. \nSPEAKER_13:  the trash area. The trash area in the rendering and the trash area on the plans are sort of depicted differently. I'm wondering if there could be a clarification on that because it's attached to the structure on the plan but then in the rendering it looks like it's a floating wall that's sort of open to the alley. \nSPEAKER_11:  I will defer to the applicant for that question, but it will be collaborating the final approved plans. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Commissioner Grasovsky. I have a couple of questions just for clarification. You said it went from a three car garage to two car garage. What is that? I'd like to see that, what that configuration is now. Is it the double car garage that, and they took away the smaller. \nSPEAKER_11:  So on the floor plan for the first floor, you can see the two car garage, but at least the layout. That's the accurate depiction there. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, I see it now. Thank you. Another question is it's a two story behind a one story. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there going to be any view? You got a 22 foot high ADU and a 17 foot high house. \nSPEAKER_02:  Has there been any kind of... \nSPEAKER_02:  research done on that and he kind of exhibit. \nSPEAKER_02:  on how much that will show from behind. \nSPEAKER_02:  the behind you and it will show from the street. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Grasovaya, we do, I think the existing single family dwelling up front is 17 feet in height. The garage at the rear is, if I remember correctly, 22. Yeah, 22. \nSPEAKER_02:  2222, he in his report he said 17 for the house 22 for the ADU and it seems like that might be \nSPEAKER_02:  visible from the street. Is that the case or is that not the case? \nSPEAKER_03:  Correct, yeah, there will be some portion of the new structure that'll be visible, but I think just in terms of a scale thing, the structure about as far back as you can go on this property. So, it kind of offsets how much visibility you can see there. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so you, so staff is satisfied with this meeting, that requirement of not being visible from the from the street. \nSPEAKER_02:  or minimally visible from the street. \nSPEAKER_03:  Correct, yeah. Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I know it's been a little while since we've seen an ADU project here at Culture and Heritage Commission. And that's because they are allowed by right under state law and there's only kind of limited cases where we would bring it here. And one of them would be when there's that visibility. And so the guidelines are to minimize that to the extent feasible without precluding their development rights under state law. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Right. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Pizzo, I had another question. \nSPEAKER_13:  seeing that the \nSPEAKER_13:  Window depiction on the ADU has a lot of millions and lights to them and I'm noticing there's a existing elevation in our packet that is the side elevation of the driveway. On the home photos that were in our packet those are double hung windows with no pain delineation at all, except for the front as you're seeing there. If you can forward the double hung windows seem plain. I think that those are part of being changed since the packet shows them differently than what exists. It said that there's nothing happening to the main original structure, the historic structure in the front and I was just wanting to clarify that. \nSPEAKER_00:  them. \nSPEAKER_11:  and no work is being proposed for the primary dwelling. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Hi, could I just get a clarification? Does the City of Long Beach have their own ADU ordinance or do you only go with the state requirements? \nSPEAKER_07:  Currently, we do technically have some stuff in our local ordinance, but it's outdated at this point. We did the ever evolving state law, so we defer to state law, although we're working on an update to have a comprehensive local ordinance. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, and so as part of your conversation about the local ordinance, will you establish two different classes, then of ADUs, those that are still exempt from local approval and then anything above? \nSPEAKER_08:  a certain square footage. \nSPEAKER_07:  We're still looking at that. We're looking at various best practices across the state. Some we've seen that sort of square footage cut off. We're also looking at other cities that have specific design guidelines for ADUs in historic districts that were kind of still in that initial phase. But happy to look at those options. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, great. Thank you. I think a 912 unit, 912 square foot ADU by right is very generous. So I'd be curious in the future how your local ordinance may impact these types of situations and historic districts, just a comment. But thank you for clarifying the nature of state versus local and the current position, you're under. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this is Commissioner Grasov, if you just to add on to that square footage question. My understanding is it's 1200 square feet. His kind of what the planning department is the maximum ADU for the city of Long Beach right now. And that's a detached one. And this one actually goes slightly over. \nSPEAKER_02:  that if you had the rumpus room. \nSPEAKER_02:  on the first floor. So just again a staff question. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Just take a look. \nSPEAKER_12:  Yeah \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Just so we're all clear, the Rumpus Room doesn't count as ADU square footage because not part of the ADU. So the square footage is the square footage. The state law does allow 800 square feet, but then it allows more square footage if you meet the sub-axx and other criteria. So that's the situation we find ourselves in. Our local ordinance may use square footage, although part of what we're thinking about now is this one's pretty nicely designed. We see a lot of ADUs that are ugly. Most of those are not in historic districts. So we may have an ordinance that's very permissive, but also requires the applicant to meet various design standards and other standards. And that's the local approach. And then if you don't want to comply with the local approach, you get the benefit of the state law, but you don't get any streamlining. And that's kind of the architecture that we're thinking about now. But that ordinance is still six plus months out, so certainly we can give this commission an update before we take it to the planning commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great, thank you. I know it's a lot of discussion, upfront discussion, but I just wanted to clarify those things. I appreciate the responses. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you Commissioner Grosavee. Any other commissioners would like to speak on this item before we open up to public. \nSPEAKER_10:  Vice-Termic Juan, I believe there's an open question for the applicant from Commissioner Piso. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  I live at 1837. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would like to have the applicant address permission. \nSPEAKER_09:  The Abortion. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  if the applicant could. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, we can understand you have to find. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I said we're going to have the applicant address the commission at this time before we open up to public comment. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  I said. \nSPEAKER_04:  That would be you. \nSPEAKER_05:  We are proceeding here. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mae Belo \nSPEAKER_05:  and um \nSPEAKER_05:  my \nSPEAKER_05:  Home is in bad need of, it's in disrepair, there's a lot of repairs in \nSPEAKER_05:  ac roedd hyn yn mynd, mae fan weda'r meddwl \u00e2 yr effeithio eich dod at fast ac hunnaosti \u00e2m. \nSPEAKER_05:  al jeg meth ik Chairman.

There was one question regarding. \nSPEAKER_13:  you like. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yeah, I had a question earlier about the trash area. It's depicted in different ways or it seems to be depicted in different ways on the rendering versus the plans. Is there a final design on that or? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, the idea was to enclose the trash, to keep it tidy from the alley. \nSPEAKER_05:  and to be a gate on there, I noticed in the roundering that there was not a gate there, but it should be a gate in front. \nSPEAKER_05:  airb\u012blaw ir mi'r rhau hyd yn mochasynthan i no.

In fact, it's very... \nSPEAKER_09:  stark and modern looking. \nSPEAKER_09:  It has no details whatsoever. It's a series of boxes. \nSPEAKER_09:  So \nSPEAKER_09:  It would seem that \nSPEAKER_09:  The design could be changed to look a little more like the house. It doesn't fit in with it at all. That's my only comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  for the record, your name and your address. \nSPEAKER_01:  You need a address please? Yes, Mike Bauer-Master. I'm here just because I have, we own the house, that's right next to it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you went to your... \nSPEAKER_01:  front picture there. \nSPEAKER_01:  And all I want to do is my wife is the one that handles all this. She's at a town, so I'm here. \nSPEAKER_01:  trying to represent \nSPEAKER_01:  her comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is \nSPEAKER_01:  At the house, there is a gate. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we have the archway that's right next to it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Let's talk about five feet. \nSPEAKER_01:  And there was a survey that was supposed to be completed and we just would like to find out. \nSPEAKER_01:  within that survey, what part of that property line is ours. We have no problem with anything that they want to do on the home. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's not the issue with us. \nSPEAKER_01:  We just want to determine, especially since it's a historical home. \nSPEAKER_01:  what is the property line and what will be coming up that straight front area. \nSPEAKER_01:  So in the very front. \nSPEAKER_01:  picture of you had of the front of the house there's an archway i don't know if you could put it up there \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  But there's an archway there. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it shows about five feet, which is \nSPEAKER_01:  They have a gate there. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I think that's part of our property. I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we'd like to get that recognized because we might have. \nSPEAKER_01:  some costs associated with putting a fence up or whatever the case may be. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I don't know if that's something we go through the building department for. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's why I'm here. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Would staff like to address that? \nSPEAKER_10:  Vice-Chair McGowan, can we finish public comment and maybe direct any outstanding questions to staff? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there anyone here that would like to address this particular item on the agenda? \nSPEAKER_04:  If there is not, then we'll open it up to our Zoom public call. \nSPEAKER_06:  If joining Teleponically. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm sorry if you're joining virtually please use the raise hand function if you would like to make public comment on this item please. \nSPEAKER_06:  There appears to be no public comment on this item. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Before we call for the motion, we would like to have the staff address any issue that came up. \nSPEAKER_12:  So City staff doesn't arbitrate property line disputes between two private property owners. That said, this project's going through permitting. So as part of the building permit process, which is different than the initial step here, we'd be glad to speak with the property owner, share the plans, share the documents to the degree that's helpful to them. But in terms of any arbitration or dispute about the property line, that's not the city. That's just a civil matter between the two neighbors to hopefully work out in a friendly way. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, staff. At this time, the applicant would like to address. \nSPEAKER_05:  Steyna Clif Ste Anotherams y pushden cy\u672d.

I would like to take this item behind the bar. Is there any additional comments from the commission to the staff or to the applicant? \nSPEAKER_13:  So I did hear some public. Oh, sorry Commissioner Pizzo. I do appreciate the comment about the structure being a box virtually. I'd just like to acknowledge that I understand the garage was literally a box and many of the Spanish homes in that neighborhood do have this delineation of a flat roof. But they're one story. This one it gets to the two story height is starting to be a little concerning with the mass and scale. It seems. And I'm wondering if there's any exploration in a drop in the parapet from the stairwell center where the three windows are where that could get lightened up a bit because right now it seems quite, quite heavy as a upper line. And it seems like viewing your property that you would see this tall mass in the back. So I'm just wondering if there's something we could do to lighten up the structure in the back. Have it relationship to the gabled structure in the front. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you Commissioner Peasle. \nSPEAKER_04:  Would staff want to address this or will? \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Chair, I think that's probably a good question for the applicant. \nSPEAKER_05:  ac mae'n meisiablygu\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd beth oedd d san Roof da rehoorden cyfyr.
