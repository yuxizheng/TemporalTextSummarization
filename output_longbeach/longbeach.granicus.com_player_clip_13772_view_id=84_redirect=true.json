So I think I had mentioned recently that when we started working we used the survey that had been done by Auditor Dowd as the framework for what work we were going to work on. And we're making some good progress on that. We're out of COVID now so there are more things that we could do. \nSPEAKER_03:  We, the one thing we've never done is a strategic plan. So we've had no, no opportunity to do a SWAT assessment and get any input from the community, be elected to the staff of what things they think that we as an ethics commission should work on. So I'm hoping that each of you would support and would be interested in doing something with a strategic plan. I've also had conversation with April about the possibility of seeking some funding as we learned at our last meeting. That there's no staff to support us as we go out. And if we really want to go out and secure input from the community, we would need funding in order to do that. It's an item that if we pass this motion today, I'll be putting in our budget briefing. The vice chair and I just met with the mayor to bring him up to date on what we're working on. And as I mentioned a strategic plan, he got very excited. He was mentioning that when he was part of various commissions, they all did a strategic plan and that a strategic plan could help as we send things to the council down the road because a strategic plan, if we do it and then we send it to the council to kind of sign off on, that's our joint agreement on what the priorities are for this organization to work on. So is there any comments from the other commissioners? \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_02:  What do you see as the relationship between the work plan that we adopted and the strategic plan, if any, or what would happen to the work plan if the strategic plans adopted? \nSPEAKER_03:  So the work plan we are, we have made some very good progress on the items in the work plan. There's not a lot left for us to address there. The strategic plan is going to take at least a year. \nSPEAKER_03:  if not a little more. So I would see it's continuing to work on the work plan. Whoever comes into consult with us, we can talk about things that aren't there and have input from the public on that. But at some point in time when there is a strategic plan, then I would think that that action plan would go away and the strategic plan would be the focus of what we're addressing. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I have, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  One other question. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does the does the relationship between the commission and the City Council require that the City Council approve the strategic plan that That this group adopts or is that I don't think it does but it \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think it does, but it would be something we could consider. \nSPEAKER_00:  would be. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, I agree. I wouldn't say that they're required to adopt. \nSPEAKER_00:  whatever plans any commission chooses to implement or you know undergo we could do a receiving file if you wanted them if you wanted staff to present you know the nuts and bolts of the outcome. \nSPEAKER_00:  but because it's not something that they voted to request of staff and they don't typically \nSPEAKER_00:  adopt on their own. They would just do a receiving file. \nSPEAKER_03:  any other comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair. Yes. I think it may also be a good idea to consider. \nSPEAKER_01:  separating out a session. \nSPEAKER_01:  in addition to our monthly meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the strategic plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  similar like we did the retreat. \nSPEAKER_01:  because I believe it can be very involved. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I wasn't sure if that's what you had in mind. \nSPEAKER_03:  spirit. \nSPEAKER_03:  Part of what I've been talking to April about is bringing in a consultant to lead us through the process. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, no, we wouldn't do our spread. We would probably do another retreat. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Any other comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  There's no public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  So can we call the vote please? \nSPEAKER_01:  motion carries."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  All right. \nSPEAKER_03:  The next item is a recommendation to discuss amendments to the conflict of interest code regarding the Long Beach continuum of care board and golf advisory committee. Do we have a motion on this item? \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a motion by Commissioner Weiss and a second by Commissioner T. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_03:  JP who's going to... \nSPEAKER_00:  Are you making the presentation? \nSPEAKER_03:  Are you making the presentation? \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the item before use to discuss amendments to the conflict of interest code or COI code that will be sent to the City Council for approval. The amendments to the COI code add the Long Beach continue of care board and the golf advisory committee. These bodies are being added. \nSPEAKER_00:  pursuant to the FUPC regulation that requires bodies that make substantive recommendations that are approved without significant amendments by another public official or a government agency to be included in a local conflict of interest code. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, the \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach Continued with Care Board will be included in the Health and Human Services Department, CUI Code, and the Golf Advisory Committee will be included in the Parks, Recreation, and Marine Department, CUI Code. \nSPEAKER_00:  Lastly, we will also be bringing two amendments for your view at next month's meeting to add the Commission on Women and Girls Commission and the Police Commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  With that this concludes our staff report and Philip Taylor and I are available for any questions. Thank you \nSPEAKER_03:  So you all may remember in January we had a discussion about how \nSPEAKER_03:  items would be added because our charter requires that we participate with the city clerk and the biannual review and their staff had indicated they would bring them to us on a flow basis. So these are the first two that are coming forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  So are there any comments on those two? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Go ahead. So both of these organizations appear to have been in existence for a number of years. I'm wondering why they're coming up now to be added to the \nSPEAKER_02:  code. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can answer that question. \nSPEAKER_01:  Both of these bodies are not appointed by the City Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  They are embedded more in departments. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  to be transparent. I have now \nSPEAKER_01:  incidentally become in a position where I'm the commission is attorney. \nSPEAKER_01:  not just for \nSPEAKER_01:  not in the same way that I am for you, but in the sense of like, uh, \nSPEAKER_01:  compensation, the process to onboard commissioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  and what's the other part? Training of commissioners. So through compensation, my role has expanded. \nSPEAKER_01:  to really sit in a position to see everything that's happening. And part of that is accounting for bodies that maybe were overlooked in the past because the system was more fractured. So because I have an opportunity to see the entire process and I've worked with several departments, now when issues come up, my lens is different, where we can have a thoughtful conversation about, you know, these are outside bodies. Should we be putting them on the form 700? Should, you know, so in a lot of cases, the answer will be yes. Sometimes the bodies that \nSPEAKER_01:  do business not necessarily advise the city like the metropolitan water district. I think the correct me if I'm wrong Philip the member that is appointed to that body another agency is responsible for their form 700 right so we're trying to improve the process. This is one of them you know the golf advisory committee is not appointed by council. \nSPEAKER_01:  there appointed by the director of Parks Rec and Marine. So we're working through \nSPEAKER_01:  You know. \nSPEAKER_01:  ensuring that they're brought into the fold on trainings and form 700 that they're signing the \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, code of conduct and ethics. The long-reach continuum of care has been in place for quite some time. That one is unique in the sense that \nSPEAKER_01:  They're a body that were legally required to ensure exists, but we don't necessarily have control over it. But the Health Department staff works directly with them on a consistent basis. Yet they're still under our authority for filing form 700. So, they're made really hoping. I sent emails out to the attorneys this week of, hey, \nSPEAKER_01:  If we have new commissions, if you have kind of funky commissions that are under the city manager, under other departments, you know, and they're hidden out in the works and they should be brown act noticed. They are brown act notice, we need to have a conversation about. \nSPEAKER_01:  What training are these folks getting? You know, are they filing form 700s? Do they need to file form 700s? So this is part of our process to improve things and transparency in the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Anyone else? \nSPEAKER_03:  No further comments? No public? Too comment? We call the vote please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you."

And April, Heather, you were going to give the update right? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you chair. So just we had talked about this last month, but just wanted to confirm so we will move forward and hold a special meeting. For right now I've got, excuse me, Wednesday, October 25th on hold. \nSPEAKER_04:  in the civic chamber. I've got it on hold from 5 to 9 pm. We can \nSPEAKER_04:  decide what actual time we want to do it in there. This will be a hybrid meeting which will allow for public comment. However, commissioners will have to be here in person. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Chair of Vice Chair and I will be meeting with the nonprofit partnership in Long Beach forward at the end of this month just to talk about \nSPEAKER_04:  how \nSPEAKER_04:  how we'll move forward with the survey that we're going to put out and just kind of \nSPEAKER_04:  get any advice or feedback from them before we move into this meeting, making sure that we are capturing \nSPEAKER_04:  all the different groups that may want to comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  on the lobbyist ordinance recommendations. So at that being said, we will put out a survey. We're gonna let it go out for about 30 days. The ad hoc is in charge of finalizing the questions and these will be based on their questions and the questions that other commissioners sent to them. We will have this translated into our three other languages. And so with that, we'll do our typical communications which includes like immediate advisory, social media, different newsletters, including council offices. So that's a high level look for me at what that special meeting will look like and how we'll get there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_03:  coming of you in appetite starting \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair, I do. Thank you, Heather. Do you know, do you have a timeline when \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  The survey will be finalized. \nSPEAKER_00:  and when it will be going out because you said 30 days, right? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, so the ad hoc is currently working on that once we \nSPEAKER_04:  meet with the nonprofit partnership just to make sure that we've \nSPEAKER_04:  We're going after the information we need or want shortly after that. We'll send it in to be translated into the three languages on a high priority. So I imagine that it will go out the first week of September, no later than the second week. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, and thank you, and you also mentioned \nSPEAKER_00:  You mentioned nonprofit, partnership. \nSPEAKER_00:  and then language forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for including. \nSPEAKER_00:  and for considering a smaller nonprofit in the community. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  That does a lot of work as well. I know Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  nonprofit is a little bit larger. \nSPEAKER_00:  But so thank you for considering another nonprofit. \nSPEAKER_00:  to include in this meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  of course. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there a tool that you selected to use for the survey? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I will use my glue. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will use Microsoft. \nSPEAKER_04:  of programs. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Are there any other questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  JT, can we call it item? There's no public to comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, do it. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a written public comment on the matter. A message from this agenda. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, we don't normally address public comments, but when the plan, because the plan is still under development, so it's kind of hard to put it out there in the public until it's ready. So once it is totally finalized, it will be available like all of our other documents for the public. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sheriff, I could just add it, it is a little confusing. \nSPEAKER_00:  from someone looking on. \nSPEAKER_00:  The legislature website last month when I saw this item. \nSPEAKER_00:  written exactly the same way, almost exactly the same way I called Heather. \nSPEAKER_00:  because there were no attachments and I didn't understand what we were going to discuss. Sure. \nSPEAKER_00:  She just told me it was a report. \nSPEAKER_00:  which it was, but it can be confusing for members of the public, even for commissioners. Okay. When they read that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't know if there's any way to modify the agenda moving forward if there is no attachment. \nSPEAKER_00:  just to help. \nSPEAKER_03:  We can make it, probably make a note on items like that, then it'll be an oral report because the document is still, or there's nothing available on writing. We can work on that. Good point. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are we ready to vote now?"

Just a few updates this month. Taylor and I continue to work on the ethics guide. Taylor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hopefully by the end of this week going into next week we'll have updated for we'll make current that \nSPEAKER_03:  the current ethics guide, so that will \nSPEAKER_03:  be the one that we released right away as we continue to build. \nSPEAKER_03:  The greater document that we talked about last month as well as the smaller code of conduct guide. So that continues. Just a reminder that the code of conduct went out to you all last week. So \nSPEAKER_03:  just feel free to send that back to me whenever you sign that and we'll get that in your files. It did go out citywide as well. So it seems to be \nSPEAKER_03:  being received pretty good departments are looking at different creative ways to efficiently collect all of these codes of conduct so it's been neat to just to hear the different ideas that departments are trying \nSPEAKER_03:  So learn accounts. I just want to make sure that everyone's been notified that you now have access to learn. It's my understanding that you have five days once you receive that link to activate your account. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you do not activate it within that five days, just reach out to me and I'll... \nSPEAKER_03:  get you reactivated. But just a reminder to do that and take your training and looking forward to your feedback from that. I'm also working with a couple departments to get their field staff trained. So looking at \nSPEAKER_03:  We've got a powerpoint built in, so I'll be going out to a couple different departments to help them launch the training using that pathway. \nSPEAKER_03:  PRA updates just to let you all know we continue to focus on meeting legally required deadlines which is responding as to whether records exist in 10 days. We've met with both the city's executive team and all but two department management teams to educate about the legal requirements of PRAs. \nSPEAKER_03:  We anticipate that analytics will tell us by the end of the year if our efforts are working. And then the PR-T-PRA team is starting to put together the framework for FY24 trainings. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then I continue to... \nSPEAKER_03:  do my ethics presentation to various departments and commissions with an emphasis on the code of conduct and our new help line. So this week as a reminder, tomorrow is our Citizens Advisory Commission on Disabilities, our Marine Advisory Commission, and our Citizens Police Complaint Commission. Just a note if you're planning on joining me for the Friday morning Board of Health and Human Services, they did not have a quorum this month. So that's been moved to October and then next week is planning commission and Parks and Rec. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then I'm just starting to build the FY24 curriculum and communications plan. So right now what that looks like is we'll focus on our vendor code of contact, putting together a gift campaign. Julie and I were brainstorming what our holiday video is going to look like. Taylor's gonna be our elf. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll also be. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I can send it. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll also focus on PRAs and then of course we'll revisit the code of conduct training to see how we want to make that different Next year and that's my report \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. Are there any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_00:  So I just, for PRAs, our next update should be in December then. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can do it in September. There's going to be less data, but I think we... \nSPEAKER_01:  kind of have done several months of this push and so it would be interesting to see what the data looks like now and then maybe we can revisit it in several months. \nSPEAKER_00:  That sounds good. \nSPEAKER_00:  Any other questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_02:  One, of course. Okay. I know the budget, I'm not sure this is your responsibility, but I know the budget was released, the proposed budget, and I have not gone through it to see what is provided for the ethics for your department, your team. So could you tell us that in summary forum? Can someone? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so as we know, I previously announced that we're proposing a renaming or rebranding of both the ethics and the PRA teams which are under my positions oversight to the Office of Transparent Office of Ethics and Transparency. All staff will retain their current duties, but it's a joint effort that we are bringing this whole team together to really promote that there is an emphasis on ethics and transparency because they are interlinked. \nSPEAKER_01:  within the City Manager's office. \nSPEAKER_01:  given that \nSPEAKER_01:  that group has the proposed \nSPEAKER_01:  The proposed budget for that office will include a clerk type is three which will provide administrative support to both the PRA and the ethics teams which is new. It will help Heather. \nSPEAKER_01:  better track as trainings progress. This both be any type of optional training or and mandatory training which the code conduct is mandatory. \nSPEAKER_01:  That'll help her kind of do the administrative functions and run reports and data so she can distribute that and then also assist the PRA team in going through day to day PRA. So that's the ad. Nothing else structurally when I met with the assistant city manager who serves as the department head for the city manager's office about, you know, a training and materials budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  All of the programs in the City of Majors Office from climate to ethics to \nSPEAKER_01:  equity, we have a general bucket of training and materials for the City of Managers' Office. So she indicated that that could support any type of training and materials that we may need, such as conferences or, you know, lap language access translation support. \nSPEAKER_01:  If we come to a point where we need to do a bulk purchase of something, say like a promotional item, that would be something I would look to work with our \nSPEAKER_01:  based on financial manager and our city manager to allocate an identify funding. If in future years we know that \nSPEAKER_01:  you know seeing FY 25 Heather was put together a plan to launch some sort of \nSPEAKER_01:  education campaign that's going to include wind times. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would just work with her ahead of that to include it in the budget process. One times are a lot easier. \nSPEAKER_01:  to achieve menstrual funding as we look to our deficit years. Hopefully they answered your question. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, but I have one more question. \nSPEAKER_02:  which is there was reference earlier to getting a consultant to help with the strategic plan. So would that come out of that general bucket that you just decided? Is that reference? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a question, the answer is no, but because we anticipate that that cost would be minimum away $50,000. So I believe that the Chair and Vice Chair can speak to what they're including in their budget letter to the VOC. And hopefully, as in past years, they'll be able to achieve a one-time allocation through the budget process. And then if not, I can then, as I would, in any other instance, take a back tar. \nSPEAKER_01:  a city manager and city manager to see if there's any pots of funding that could be allocated to that effort. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I take it from what you've said that the funding for the staff that's currently working with the ethics commission is all taken care of already. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's been structural, I believe, went feather. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's FY22, it's just became a structural later. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, okay. Great. I think you guys, even separate from the city managers budget, I think what's important to also note is the clerk's office is asked for an additional position to provide support to them in staffing the commissions and providing support to the commissions and the city attorney's office is asked for an additional deputy city attorney to provide ethical and other advice to them. \nSPEAKER_00:  to the City Staff and Commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. So and I've already spoken with the city clerk and she understands that we will be supporting that in our letter. As I indicated, we will be making the request for the hundred. Well, I'm going to ask for $100,000 to do our strategic plan. And then Taylor, I don't know if you saw my email. I just want to make sure that Don's okay that if we put our support for her ask in our letter also. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you could recent me your email. I sent it. \nSPEAKER_00:  I know, I know, to you and Kathy, but I'll send it again. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm not sure it came through to me. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that's why I haven't responded to you. Okay. I just figured you'd be... \nSPEAKER_00:  I just figured you'd been busy all day. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Heather didn't respond to my email saying my link. \nSPEAKER_00:  wasn't working but that's because I realized I sent it to the do not reply address instead of \nSPEAKER_00:  So if you're sending Heather a note, don't send it to the do not reply. Make sure you get it to her. Are there any other questions on Heather's report? \nSPEAKER_00:  And also, as you take your training, you notice that there's not a lot of feedback on how you do. Heather already knows that that is a weakness in the system. She and I just had to talk about that a few minutes ago and she's working with HR to see if NeoGov can clean that up. So if you don't get 100%, you won't really know what you missed. Thank you for the call. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  miss \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Any other? Okay, that's... Can we call the vote on that item? Sure. Can we get on it? Did I forget to do a motion? \nSPEAKER_02:  Did I forget to do a motion? \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, I have a motion by Commissioner DiBenedictus, a second by Commissioner Fiedler, and there's no public for comment. So can we call the question? Thank you."
