Can you read the next item please? \nSPEAKER_01:  Item 2 is a recommendation to receive and file a presentation on the planning efforts for the abandonment of the Wilmington Oil Field. \nSPEAKER_06:  Perfect. Can we start with a staff report on this item? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, thank you chair and council members. Our Kevin Tugas, our oil operations manager, will provide a brief presentation. \nSPEAKER_08:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm the manager of oil operation or the research department. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  And let me just check. Can you guys hear me? Okay? \nSPEAKER_07:  We can hear you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  So today I'm here to talk about our planning efforts for the abandonment of the Wilmington oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  And as I'm sure you all know, well production has been a part of the Long Beach economy for over 100 years. \nSPEAKER_08:  Oil issues have been voted on by the city voters both to establish the oil operations in the 1960s and state waters and multiple measures to tax oil to pay for public safety. \nSPEAKER_08:  climate, health, and youth initiatives. \nSPEAKER_08:  This has resulted in complex legal agreements, infrastructure and funding that the city relies on as part of its economy and city budget. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  First let me just start off a little bit about our bureau and the various roles we play in the department. \nSPEAKER_08:  the city through \nSPEAKER_08:  The Energy Resources Department is the unit operator of the oil and gas assets assets located within the Wilmington oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  We're also the trustee for the state of California, with a gas asset, assets, and among these tightlands. \nSPEAKER_08:  We review other oil operations where the city has a financial interest. \nSPEAKER_08:  We oversee approximately 10 million barrels of oil within the city's boundaries and also manage over 2,400 active and idle production and injection wells. \nSPEAKER_08:  We're also responsible for subsidence management and post production planning. \nSPEAKER_08:  and ensure the environment is protected and no adverse conditions. \nSPEAKER_08:  or caused by our operations. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  Here's just a map showing kind of where the oil areas are within the city boundaries. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  The area labeled LBU, that's for Long Beach Unit, for our thumbs. \nSPEAKER_08:  oil island operations. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then the one fault blocks, that's our fault block unit or less sometimes referred to as West Wilmington unit. This is the area where the city is the unit operator. \nSPEAKER_08:  and this overlays the majority of the limited oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  The areas in yellow are areas where the city has a proprietary interest, but the city is not an operator. \nSPEAKER_08:  For example, \nSPEAKER_08:  the SHW, SHU, those are signal hill petroleum operated, but the city has a financial interest. \nSPEAKER_08:  We draw approximately 18. \nSPEAKER_08:  18 wells per year from the Thumbs Islands. We don't use any hydraulic fracture stimulation. \nSPEAKER_08:  and our daily production from Wilmington is approximately 22,000 per day. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  So. \nSPEAKER_08:  We'll talk a little bit about our Wilmington Oil Field abandonment liability. \nSPEAKER_08:  Long Beach Nose and Supports is a position that oil production is not in our long-term future. \nSPEAKER_08:  Our city has been planning for the end of the life of the field, which currently is estimated to be no earlier in 2035. \nSPEAKER_08:  and in advance of the governor's 2045 target date. \nSPEAKER_08:  potentially begin facing out with an extraction. \nSPEAKER_08:  The total \nSPEAKER_08:  Some of abandonment liability is currently estimated at $1.2 billion. \nSPEAKER_08:  and I'll break down how that's uh \nSPEAKER_08:  who's responsible for that in the next few slides. \nSPEAKER_08:  Each well and facility is unitized. \nSPEAKER_08:  which means the ownership and abandonment liability is shared amongst many owners. \nSPEAKER_08:  The agreements stay governed the oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  place the amendment liability on the owners. \nSPEAKER_00:  owners. \nSPEAKER_08:  and \nSPEAKER_08:  So that means that the state and the city hold the majority of that liability. \nSPEAKER_08:  The city would need to use general fund for Thailand's operating funds if we're unable to deserve the appropriate abandonment liability. \nSPEAKER_08:  amount before oil operation cease. \nSPEAKER_08:  And the city plans to take advantage of high oil prices like we're experiencing today to reserve additional funds for the environmental responsible phase out of our oil operations. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  So here's a summary of how that $1.2 billion is broken down. \nSPEAKER_08:  So the city has $133.3 million abandonment liability. And that is split between \nSPEAKER_08:  the top and uplands oil fun. \nSPEAKER_08:  The liability is directly tied to our ownership in the oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  Removal of the Thumbs Oil Islands is not a part of the abandonment liability estimate. \nSPEAKER_08:  The oil islands will be repurposed when they are no longer needed for oil operations or subsidence management. \nSPEAKER_08:  city regularly abandons wells that are no longer useful on an annual basis. And we plan to increase the number of wells we have been in each year. \nSPEAKER_08:  The state, as you can see, has a majority of the abandonment liability because they are the largest owner in the field and their estimated liability is at nine hundred and sixty seven million dollars. \nSPEAKER_08:  based on the operating agreements CRC, who is the city's oil contractor, has the smallest amount of abandonment liability at $56 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  We also have about 10% of our field is owned by individual minerals, mineral interest owners, as we sometimes call town long others. \nSPEAKER_08:  in the field. \nSPEAKER_08:  Most of these owners are homeowners who obtain their ownership through the minimal rights associated with their property. \nSPEAKER_08:  The total abandonment liability for the town line owners is approximately 60 million. And so that breaks down to about $10,000 per owner. \nSPEAKER_08:  And if you want to just look at these numbers, the city and state represent 90% of the total abandonment my ability associated with woman to \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we have been working on. \nSPEAKER_08:  planning for this and have money reserved. \nSPEAKER_08:  The city began reserving for the oil field abandonment. \nSPEAKER_08:  over 20 years ago. \nSPEAKER_08:  Our estimated current unfunded abandonment myadability sits at $74.3 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  Toph has an abandonment reserve of $46.8 million and an estimated liability of $110.3. \nSPEAKER_08:  Uplands has reserved 12.2 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  and has an estimated liability of 23 billion. \nSPEAKER_08:  for fiscal year 22. \nSPEAKER_08:  Our department plans to reserve 8.75 million in total for future. \nSPEAKER_08:  abandon it. \nSPEAKER_08:  That amount is about 25% higher than previous years to take advantage of the higher oil prices. \nSPEAKER_08:  And our department works with financial management to determine the appropriate amount to reserve each year and still support cities need for revenue. \nSPEAKER_08:  The state currently has reserved $300 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  for their share of the event. \nSPEAKER_08:  and the value is capped. \nSPEAKER_08:  and needs legislation for it to be raised any higher than that. \nSPEAKER_08:  There is an assembly bill 353 that's under consideration right now to propose to increase the reserve beyond the 300 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  So the overall unfunded liability currently for the state is at $667 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  State legislation now requires oil operators, like our contractor CRC, to bond for their abandonment liability, and our contractor has complied with that. \nSPEAKER_08:  requirement. \nSPEAKER_08:  City is working with the town law owners to help them prepare for their future abandoning expense. \nSPEAKER_08:  Talon owners do have the option though to proclaim their ownership in the oil field to avoid prevailing with liability. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we'll talk a little bit about our planning. \nSPEAKER_08:  and what it would look like when we were... \nSPEAKER_08:  getting closer to abandonment. \nSPEAKER_08:  So currently, un-economic wells are banned in using operating revenue to decrease the inventory of idle wells that we have. \nSPEAKER_08:  When oil operation cease, the city will likely go out and bid for a new contractor that is focused solely on abandoning wells, imposing out the oil. \nSPEAKER_08:  abandonment progression will occur first in areas that have become un-economic to operate. \nSPEAKER_08:  It is anticipated that abandonment well work will require probably at least five years, maybe three to five years to complete and told. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  So let me talk a little bit about some of our planning risks. The first risk is oil price. Right now, as you guys are probably all aware, the price is over $100. But an oil price collapse could \nSPEAKER_08:  risk our abandonment funds because we obviously still need to support city services. So if the price is not high enough, we can't reserve enough money for our abandonment reserve. \nSPEAKER_08:  Another risk that I'm sure we're all aware of right now is inflation. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we have, you know, assumed inflation in our \nSPEAKER_08:  our cost for abandonment. \nSPEAKER_08:  So that's one risk that is out there. But we, our department assumes that cost savings when the entire focus of the operation will be on abandoning oil. Abandoning the oil to it. \nSPEAKER_08:  Another risk is regulation changes that could increase the cost of abandonment or shorten the economic life of the oilfield before the fully funded abandonment liability target date of 2035. \nSPEAKER_08:  And there's always the risk of a financial situation that requires the city to use the abandonment reserve for another purpose. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  So even after we're done producing, we still have another job to do and that's our post production, society and management. \nSPEAKER_08:  After a little operation sees cities will still need to inject water to ensure stable elevation. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's unknown at this time how long that would take, but we're assuming a minimum of five years. \nSPEAKER_08:  Post production will require a smaller footprint likely only needing two islands for post production injection and a much smaller footprint within the harbor. \nSPEAKER_08:  State legislation established this exciting fund to pay for the management of surface elevations in post production. \nSPEAKER_08:  The funds are approximately $180 million already reserved. \nSPEAKER_08:  The subsidence fund will also fund the abandonment of the remaining wells and facilities that support post production and injection. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Coke. \nSPEAKER_08:  This is just an estimate of our forecast where we see oil production over the next 13 years. \nSPEAKER_08:  The field is estimated to be producing approximately 10,000 barrels per day by 2035. \nSPEAKER_08:  Production today, like I said earlier, is 22,000. So this is over a 15%. \nSPEAKER_08:  50% loss in production over the next 13 years. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, and then \nSPEAKER_08:  We'll have a slide here about financial impact of our operations, oil operations. Total annual net revenue to the city is estimated at $45 million for fiscal year 22. \nSPEAKER_08:  28 million of that is to the general and Toth from the city's ownership in the oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that's based on $55 at will. So obviously, today's price is that that number is going to be \nSPEAKER_08:  a little higher than that. \nSPEAKER_08:  We also get an additional $17 million in tax revenue from property taxes, sales tax, and utility users tax. \nSPEAKER_08:  The oil field supports over 1,000 local jobs. \nSPEAKER_08:  the Oil Revenue Fund Public Safety Community Service and Capital Projects within the TILENS. \nSPEAKER_08:  State of California is net revenue and just year 21. \nSPEAKER_08:  from the Women's and Oil Field was approximately $70 million. \nSPEAKER_08:  and the little operations have generated more than $5 billion for the state, the city and the county since 2003. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thanks, Mike. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_08:  Safety and environment is number one priority for the city when operating the women's and oil field. \nSPEAKER_08:  LBR is fully committed to continuing to protect the \nSPEAKER_08:  Cities environmental landscape and ensuring new adverse conditions arise as a result of its oil operations. \nSPEAKER_08:  We've had no major oil spills to the ocean in the history of the city's oil operations. Over the last 10 years, the total of 10 gallons of oil have been spilled to the ocean. \nSPEAKER_08:  Well drilling is limited to areas to find in the city's municipal code. \nSPEAKER_08:  We don't use any fresh water in our oil operations. \nSPEAKER_08:  We haven't used hydraulic fracture wall stimulation since 2013. \nSPEAKER_08:  city staff conduct quarterly safety inspections and we also assist the inspectors from the state. \nSPEAKER_08:  with their inspections as well. \nSPEAKER_08:  We're working on a project to add one megawatt solar power to our oil operations. \nSPEAKER_08:  and \nSPEAKER_08:  the decrease in oil production. \nSPEAKER_08:  represents 11% of the city's 2030 cat goal for CO2 reduction. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_08:  So in summary. \nSPEAKER_08:  Almych knows and supports the position at oil production. \nSPEAKER_08:  is not in our long-term future. \nSPEAKER_08:  Subsidence management will continue beyond the life of the oil field and funding is already secured for that effort. \nSPEAKER_08:  The city will continue to reserve funds for its abandonment obligations and support states efforts to properly save for their share of the abandonment liability. \nSPEAKER_08:  Continue to work with local, state, and federal agencies that regulate the oil operations. \nSPEAKER_08:  maintain a best in class safety and a brown bright environmental record at thumbs. \nSPEAKER_08:  Explore ideas to offset carbon footprint for all your operations through records like solar power which I mentioned before and carbon sequestration. \nSPEAKER_08:  and continue to generate oil revenue for the city while ensuring the environment is protected and no adverse conditions are caused by our operations. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that concludes my presentation. Be happy to answer any questions you may have. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Great. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_06:  Madam Clerk, I would like to start with public comment. If we can do that, I have. \nSPEAKER_06:  a tentative motion after the public comment and \nSPEAKER_06:  Also, if it looks like there is more than 10 commenters on this item. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_06:  Let's follow the Council Protocol. \nSPEAKER_06:  and set the clock to 90 seconds. Is that okay? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, chair, that's fine right now. It looks like we have four hands raised, but hands are still going. \nSPEAKER_09:  If there's any members of the public that wish to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature or if dialing dial star 9. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, a first speaker is Annie B. Your time to get to the end. You have three minutes. \nSPEAKER_13:  I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, we can hear you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you so much. My name is Mary and Buchanan and I live in district free. I had some longer comments, but I'm going to keep them shorter. I put some specific questions into the e comments, but I wanted to ask about the issue of how town lot owners will deal with abandonment costs. I'm afraid this is going to hit some people out of the blue. Many town lot owners are individuals who may have inherited their oil and gas interest decades ago, who perhaps have never seen the original oil and gas lease and who have no idea there are abandonment costs looming and $10,000 can be a lot of money for some people. \nSPEAKER_13:  How and when is the city informing town lot owners? \nSPEAKER_13:  of their contractual obligations to pay a portion of the costs for abandoning well. Are you planning to hold forums and out mailers? \nSPEAKER_00:  I think I'm doing well. \nSPEAKER_13:  can't tell them a lot owner contact at Long Beach Energy Resources. \nSPEAKER_13:  for information. If you could address this one topic. \nSPEAKER_13:  I would appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_13:  And if I have time, I just want to commend you. \nSPEAKER_13:  for at least you doing. \nSPEAKER_13:  what it just cannot be easy to get away from a commodity that has been the operational heart of your department for decades. So the fact that you're doing it is even more commendable. I thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, our next speaker is Dave Schukele. \nSPEAKER_03:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, we can hear you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you and thanks to Director Tugas for that informative presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  as a climate person, it should be said. \nSPEAKER_03:  that the most environmentally responsible. \nSPEAKER_03:  way. \nSPEAKER_03:  Woah... \nSPEAKER_03:  ahhh \nSPEAKER_03:  transition off. \nSPEAKER_03:  oil and gas. \nSPEAKER_03:  in fossil fuels generally would have been yesterday. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  one of \nSPEAKER_03:  market uncertainty. \nSPEAKER_03:  with this commodity. \nSPEAKER_03:  of oil. \nSPEAKER_03:  um, is the poll cost accounting of it? \nSPEAKER_03:  with a . \nSPEAKER_03:  Paul. \nSPEAKER_03:  damage, harm. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a beautiful, awesome damage. \nSPEAKER_03:  due to climate, you know, \nSPEAKER_03:  changes and climate disaster. \nSPEAKER_03:  some of which \nSPEAKER_03:  the oil operations in the city are pretty directly responsible. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's hard to imagine, for instance, how the Silverado fire. \nSPEAKER_03:  what had happened. \nSPEAKER_03:  if the city hadn't ramped up oil production in 2020 when and how it did. \nSPEAKER_03:  in fact. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, just weeks after it did. \nSPEAKER_03:  in August of 2020. \nSPEAKER_03:  We had a lot of grid pro. \nSPEAKER_03:  because of how much electricity and water are required. \nSPEAKER_03:  Arm of hand OP \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  We want to hear that there's a thousand jobs and a certain amount of tax revenue and that this is a money maker. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's only from a very, very, very narrow perspective. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  we could have. \nSPEAKER_03:  10,000 jobs. \nSPEAKER_03:  for instance, if the city and state department. \nSPEAKER_03:  were to be created in the next couple of months to rapidly \nSPEAKER_03:  transition ourselves off the fuel source and towards things like solar power and wind. \nSPEAKER_03:  but solar power omega watt, one mega watt. \nSPEAKER_03:  presumably one megawatt hour. \nSPEAKER_03:  of solar for... \nSPEAKER_03:  continued oil operations since the definition for verse, especially when \nSPEAKER_03:  They're being proposed in the literal physical place where you would want to path in electricity from offshore wind. \nSPEAKER_03:  But that may be an opportunity that this city. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  just misses out on entirely and other cities get gobble up all the market shit. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the energy is something that we play through the nose and other cities sell to us. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  The issue of turn-out owners being contacted is important. It's something that was discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  As you may know, in the past couple of Sustainable City Commission meetings in November and December. \nSPEAKER_03:  Actually, sorry, December and January. \nSPEAKER_03:  when they hit them up. \nSPEAKER_03:  And finally, I should. \nSPEAKER_03:  No, it's for the record. \nSPEAKER_03:  is the major health ruling, public health ruling. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  California Department of Conservation, CalGEM, their geologic energy and minerals. \nSPEAKER_03:  Farman. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, on step backs from oil and gas activities, physical step backs, distances because oil and gas operations are known. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Our next speaker is Chris Chavez. \nSPEAKER_09:  Your three minutes begin now. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes, afternoon, Council members has Chris Chavez speaking where I self I am a district seven resident. \nSPEAKER_10:  I just want to commend the council members for beginning to think through and \nSPEAKER_10:  start moving along between the direction towards a oil-free future. \nSPEAKER_10:  We know it's going to be difficult. \nSPEAKER_10:  We have to plan this out accordingly. We have to make sure. \nSPEAKER_10:  to avoid harm to the community, we have to make sure to do this in a way. \nSPEAKER_10:  that makes sense for Long Beach and I truly \nSPEAKER_10:  understand the the enormity of that task going forward. \nSPEAKER_10:  but at the end of the day, as others have mentioned. \nSPEAKER_10:  you have significant \nSPEAKER_10:  public health impacts of significant environmental impacts, of significant impacts to our community for not going with this transition. \nSPEAKER_10:  which ultimately is inevitable. \nSPEAKER_10:  Long Beach will one day right out of oil. \nSPEAKER_10:  One day the world economy is going to start reducing its reliance to the oil. It already is starting to reduce its reliance. \nSPEAKER_10:  it was going in that direction. \nSPEAKER_10:  So I really do encourage \nSPEAKER_10:  uh, you know, this process. \nSPEAKER_10:  again, want to thank council members. \nSPEAKER_10:  One thing I would say in terms of abandonment. \nSPEAKER_10:  That was a abandonment was an issue that was identified in the 8617 community steering committee for women can carcin and west lawn beach. \nSPEAKER_10:  I believe that mostly oil wells within Long Beach are not under that plan, but certainly I would encourage. \nSPEAKER_10:  the council and city staff to ensure consistency with the AB617 community emission reduction plan going forward. So I appreciate again this conversation. I appreciate your work. \nSPEAKER_10:  and personally support this effort. Thank you very much for your time. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Our next speaker is Sono Coffee. Your three minutes begin now. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much council members and to the staff for this presentation and bringing this item forward. \nSPEAKER_04:  We know this is a very tough issue, and the others I commend you for bringing this on. We really want energy resources in the city to look at this issue, not just from the financial sense, but also through sustainability lens, where it's not just economics, but we're also looking at equity and the environment. This is not an easy task by any means, but starting this discussion is the first step, and we've heard some of this information on the status of the field and the liability from energy resources over the last few months. \nSPEAKER_04:  And what we would ask is that the committee and the council direct the department to really design a robust plan for this phase out with the steps that need to happen today, not waiting for that 2035 timeframe with that longer timeframe in the future. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, as we're looking at the financial revenues that the loss from that to the city's budgets. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're not factoring in the impacts and the burdens that are felt locally and globally from oil production. So there's that you know that other lens that piece needs to be incorporated into this analysis as you move forward and we hope you know today being Earth Day. \nSPEAKER_04:  and myself representing a resident of the third district where I have an oil well right in the backyard. \nSPEAKER_04:  And as a member of your Sustainable City Commission, we've asked the City Council to declare a climate emergency so you can stop the issuance of new permits for drilling. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  and help the energy resources direct them to start creating programs that will expand and rapidly decarbonize our use of fossil fuels. We understand there's a push and pull that we have a need for fossil fuels that users continue to drive cars, to power our buildings, to use appliances in our homes and kitchens, but the energy resources department can really help us offer alternatives to transition away from that so we can reduce the need to produce this oil here in our city. \nSPEAKER_04:  comes with that. We're asking for you to move forward directing the staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  that jokes, Florida's opportunities. \nSPEAKER_04:  working with the state, working with the county. There's significant amounts of funding out there now to help support this transition and the Long Beach isn't a really really good place to be able to take advantage. \nSPEAKER_04:  of that. So thank you for having discussion and for offering the opportunity. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Our next speaker is Pete Marsh. Your three minutes begin now. \nSPEAKER_11:  Good afternoon unmuted. Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, we can. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Great, thank you. I could afternoon council members. Thank you very much for taking on this issue for the leading, for the council, for the city and our citizens. \nSPEAKER_11:  strongly support the comments, especially from Chris Chavez and Sonicafe, especially the climate emergency request that Sonicafe mentioned today, the Sustainable City Commission has already put that forward and recent months. \nSPEAKER_11:  really encourage the city to adopt that. \nSPEAKER_11:  I also strongly support the programs in the Sustainable City Commission's memo. \nSPEAKER_11:  to help with rebates and other approaches to decarbonizing the city's operations. As you recall, I spoke on Tuesday night to the city council on one specific small topic, the ordering of eight new trash trucks. \nSPEAKER_11:  you. \nSPEAKER_11:  If we could have ordered those electric, that would have been fantastic. \nSPEAKER_11:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_11:  that apparently is not feasible yet, but \nSPEAKER_11:  That it, that it. \nSPEAKER_11:  Electrified Economy is rapidly changing so keep the Council and the city staff on their toes please to look for \nSPEAKER_11:  every opportunity to replace any fossil-fueled machine. \nSPEAKER_11:  in our city. \nSPEAKER_11:  with an electric machine when it reaches its end of life. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  Let's see. I also support acceleration to the end of oil drilling here if at all possible and feasible. \nSPEAKER_11:  and I'm fully aware of it. \nSPEAKER_11:  in some ways that's kind of a token gesture because there will be plenty of other places for the world to purchase oil. \nSPEAKER_11:  But let's phase out as rapidly as we can. \nSPEAKER_11:  focus on a just transition for all those workers here in our economy. \nSPEAKER_11:  One really concrete thing locally we can do is \nSPEAKER_11:  put an emphasis on detection leakage from pipes, methane, especially, and monitor that to detect it, and then plug any leaks. \nSPEAKER_11:  That's all I have for now. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_11:  Happy Earth Day. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Our final speaker is Nicole Levin. \nSPEAKER_09:  your three minutes begin now. \nSPEAKER_12:  Hi, my name is Nicole Evan and I'm calling on behalf of the CR club and I'm calling out like everyone else has stated I want to echo the \nSPEAKER_12:  the gratitude to the City Council to \nSPEAKER_12:  for looking into how to transition away from \nSPEAKER_12:  oil drilling, we know it leads to a host of public health impacts ranging from \nSPEAKER_12:  Azma. \nSPEAKER_12:  to cancer, to increase COVID death. I'm currently on my way to the panel, where one of my volunteers is going to talk about how he's lost two. \nSPEAKER_12:  of his spouses. \nSPEAKER_12:  to cancer and he lives right by oil drilling and so this is like a real \nSPEAKER_12:  real public health emergency and I really \nSPEAKER_12:  really urge our city council and \nSPEAKER_12:  Energy Resources Department to \nSPEAKER_12:  to treat it as one and we're on a coalition with a bunch of other organizations including communities for a better environment, I'm Natural Resources Defense Council, communities. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_12:  you know, stand LA and Los Angeles, who are all urging at Long Beach to \nSPEAKER_12:  Quickly. \nSPEAKER_12:  phase out and clean up their oil drilling and ban new drilling. \nSPEAKER_12:  It's definitely more, very complicated and long to be true understand that, but we really support, you know, efforts to quickly figure out how to do this and \nSPEAKER_12:  to treat it like the public health crisis that it is. So yeah, thank you for having this meeting today and starting this discussion, but um. \nSPEAKER_12:  Yeah, this is a very, very tiny matter and people are already dying. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, that concludes public comment for the item. \nSPEAKER_06:  There's some. \nSPEAKER_06:  and we sure appreciate. \nSPEAKER_06:  hearing your views or comments, patients that we can ask some questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  prior to the making of a substantive. \nSPEAKER_06:  ah motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I first of all want to say a huge thank you to Kevin. \nSPEAKER_06:  for the presentation. \nSPEAKER_06:  And while I was happy to see the report. \nSPEAKER_06:  and noted that some surplus oil revenues are already planned to be reserved to fund the phase-out of oil operations. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we need to go further. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I do have \nSPEAKER_06:  a few questions to start. I see. \nSPEAKER_06:  that are approximately 1000 jobs. \nSPEAKER_06:  are supported by oil. \nSPEAKER_06:  and jobs are supported simply by oil wells and drilling in particular. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're asking if the jobs are supported by drilling. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, so so I know that there's a there's a thousand jobs that support oil and gas operations, but do you know how many of those jobs are supported just by the just by all my oils and drilling. \nSPEAKER_08:  from drilling alone. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's probably not a large portion of the of the thousand. \nSPEAKER_08:  employees that are here. A lot of a lot of the staff are involved in the day to day just maintaining the facilities and maintaining the operations. We have a lot of \nSPEAKER_08:  pipefitters. \nSPEAKER_08:  members who are doing a lot of backhoe work. \nSPEAKER_08:  Well, Dean, stuff like that. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then do you have an estimate of how many jobs would be supported by? \nSPEAKER_06:  solar wind. \nSPEAKER_06:  green hydrogen and other clean energy. \nSPEAKER_06:  and also the abandonment and abatement activities. \nSPEAKER_08:  You don't know, in terms of the renewable jobs, I don't have that number. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then currently for the abandonment we use existing, we're using our existing contractor to take care of our wells that we're abandoning. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  So it's part of the thousand I mentioned earlier. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, there'd be further thought. Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  on flight 12. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  the production from that revenue for FY22 is now \nSPEAKER_06:  45 million. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you? \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you remind us what last year's net revenue was? \nSPEAKER_08:  I should have that off top of my head, but I... \nSPEAKER_08:  I don't recall what that number was. It was probably \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sorry, I don't know that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, if you could just get that over to us, sometimes that would be great. I just I'd like to know what that \nSPEAKER_06:  the differences. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  Also. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't do any fracking. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we haven't been any fracking since 2013. \nSPEAKER_06:  Do we have? \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there a policy in Long Beach? \nSPEAKER_06:  that band's fracking. \nSPEAKER_08:  There is not a policy that fans fracking. \nSPEAKER_08:  We did receive permits to do hydrogyzed factoring, I think in 2012 or 2000. \nSPEAKER_08:  for team to do additional ones beyond the ones that we had done. \nSPEAKER_08:  And at that time, the price of oil had started to pull back. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_08:  from when we're pulling back from being $100 last time. \nSPEAKER_08:  And it was for economic reasons we decided not to pursue it. And then we just haven't looked at it again. But there's no actual policy within. \nSPEAKER_08:  a long beach. Good night. \nSPEAKER_08:  band's breaking. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, Kevin, thank you. And also, can you provide more information about the 1-M Solar Project? \nSPEAKER_08:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_08:  That if it happens would be in the harbor district in puree west. We have a set aside area there where. \nSPEAKER_08:  We have quite a few bit of land and yeah we would put in one megawatt of solar and it would be electricity to be to offset our electrical demand. \nSPEAKER_08:  for our oil operations. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I have another question on jot it down here. So I've gotten a lot of a crap or request, especially from my constituents and I in the second district. \nSPEAKER_06:  who are advocates. \nSPEAKER_00:  you all. \nSPEAKER_06:  to declare a climate emergency. \nSPEAKER_06:  What would be involved in doing so? \nSPEAKER_06:  and the staff have any concerns with doing such. \nSPEAKER_08:  I actually don't know what that. \nSPEAKER_08:  what declaring a climate emergency would mean. \nSPEAKER_08:  Part of the other recommendation is I think of \nSPEAKER_08:  I heard them say a ban on any future drilling in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_08:  And the concern we would have there is that when we're making our estimates for \nSPEAKER_08:  Reserving money for abandonment. Part of that is still an investment in the field. It's not just writing that decline curve without making any investments. So our concern would be that we wouldn't have the appropriate funds. \nSPEAKER_08:  to provide for city programs and reserve enough for our abandonment liability. \nSPEAKER_08:  if we weren't able to invest in the field. \nSPEAKER_08:  You're doing. \nSPEAKER_06:  My next question is, have a, what is the lifespan of a newly drilled well? \nSPEAKER_08:  On average, they last about 10 years. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then how long will it take to pay off? \nSPEAKER_06:  the investment of a newly drilled well. \nSPEAKER_08:  Today is probably about six months. Typically though, it would be about a year and a half to two years. It depends on how much the cost is to drill. \nSPEAKER_08:  spray vertical well is a little cheaper than a horizontal. \nSPEAKER_08:  But in today's dollars with today's price, it may be out very quickly. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right. \nSPEAKER_06:  I know that I had previously asked city staff to \nSPEAKER_06:  developed a map showing when specific oil sites. \nSPEAKER_06:  our plant, our \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  plan to be abandoned so that the public. \nSPEAKER_06:  can be better informed. \nSPEAKER_06:  and I understand this would be a living document and at precise dates. \nSPEAKER_06:  are difficult, if not impossible, but have any idea when this type of document would be available. \nSPEAKER_08:  You broke up a little bit there when you were speaking. Are you saying a document specifying where certain areas would be no longer active oil producing areas? \nSPEAKER_06:  Correct. Yeah, we had asked the city staff to do that before like a map showing when. \nSPEAKER_06:  specific oil sites or plan to be abandoned. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, that would be... \nSPEAKER_08:  A little challenging right now the way we're doing is we have wells that are un-economic and we will abandon them if they don't have any useful light but there's a lot of times there are other wells around them that are still economic and that will continue. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  we have well. \nSPEAKER_08:  In general, I would say \nSPEAKER_08:  as we go from west to east the field gets more economical. \nSPEAKER_08:  So if you're looking for areas where we probably will be shutting down first, it would be \nSPEAKER_08:  The stuff in the harbor, kind of west, like fault blocks one and two, and as we, and kind of moving east. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  be my guest on how we would. \nSPEAKER_08:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_08:  shut down the field. \nSPEAKER_08:  It would be really difficult to say like. \nSPEAKER_08:  When wreck park is no longer going to be, you know, operation, you know, our parts of signal help the Troyons operations are no longer going to be. \nSPEAKER_08:  Uh-huh. \nSPEAKER_08:  in production. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, thank you. And so I just, I think I have just all in this. I had a lot of questions for you. But on a whole, I just want to go on record. I support ending and new drilling as soon as legally. \nSPEAKER_06:  Are you. Isings of the \nSPEAKER_06:  And I know that LA County unanimously. \nSPEAKER_06:  designated oil and gas extraction as legal non-conforming uses in all zones. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so, \nSPEAKER_06:  I support us working towards this and doing it as soon as we possibly can. \nSPEAKER_00:  soon as we go. \nSPEAKER_06:  With that being said, thank you, my colleagues, for allowing me to get to a lot of questions. Are there any questions from my colleagues on this report? \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I'm not hearing anything so after. \nSPEAKER_06:  after talking to advocates in the mayor, I'd like to move this. \nSPEAKER_06:  Committee. \nSPEAKER_06:  recommend to the City Council to direct the City Manager to take the following actions. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I'm going to read this to you. I'm going to request. \nSPEAKER_06:  inclusion in the LA County or LA. \nSPEAKER_06:  today. \nSPEAKER_06:  for you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  bye \nSPEAKER_06:  are worked with their consultants on a similar. \nSPEAKER_06:  one ourselves. \nSPEAKER_06:  and report the cost of doing so. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'd like to direct some percentage of oil any other process that I see with abandonment alongside important one time capital and that city staff and the state led committee pushed the state hard to fully fund \nSPEAKER_00:  Any other questions? \nSPEAKER_00:  that's \nSPEAKER_06:  their portion of the abandonment liability. \nSPEAKER_06:  work with the AQMD to prioritize the leakage mitigation and detection. \nSPEAKER_06:  Emissions control. \nSPEAKER_06:  and carbon catching measures. \nSPEAKER_06:  work with labor organizations, the transition workers. \nSPEAKER_06:  and our local energy sector. \nSPEAKER_06:  to equally good jobs. \nSPEAKER_06:  and to ensure they are at the table every step of the way. \nSPEAKER_06:  and work with the City Attorney and State Lamps Commission and other applicable state entities to determine legal options available to the city, the city to end new drilling as soon as legally dependable. \nSPEAKER_06:  including, you know, studying, prohibiting new oil and gas extractions in all zones, and studying oil and gas extractions. \nSPEAKER_06:  to a legal non-warming use in all zones. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I make the motion and can I get a second? \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_14:  So, thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Madam Chair. \nSPEAKER_14:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  A mi... \nSPEAKER_05:  I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  what you're doing is very aspirational. \nSPEAKER_05:  I mean. \nSPEAKER_05:  That is a lot to digest. And I am. \nSPEAKER_05:  curious. \nSPEAKER_05:  Would it have been possible to include that in the initial? \nSPEAKER_05:  motion before the presentation so that \nSPEAKER_05:  We could drill into that a little bit more because I heard the presentation that I heard it with a very \nSPEAKER_05:  Open-hearted. \nSPEAKER_05:  no intent I thought a receive and file was approaching. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so. \nSPEAKER_05:  I have a lot of questions now. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'd be interested in. \nSPEAKER_05:  probably a meeting with staff on going over the presentation again with these with this motion in mind. \nSPEAKER_05:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_05:  because I know that there's a lot of \nSPEAKER_05:  requirements and costs. \nSPEAKER_05:  that I wasn't really. \nSPEAKER_05:  criticizing or critiquing or not criticizing but \nSPEAKER_05:  trying to figure out. \nSPEAKER_05:  as I was watching the presentation does that make sense? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, so I guess a report and it will come back to council. So I mean, we have plenty of time to to. \nSPEAKER_06:  to dive into more questions. But we can go back. If you have any questions, please, support your search and ask any questions that you like. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would request and this is just a thought. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we \nSPEAKER_05:  write the agenda item. \nSPEAKER_05:  with the full motion included. \nSPEAKER_05:  and hear it at the committee so that members of the community \nSPEAKER_05:  could provide their feedback to this committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  on the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  not the report. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye-bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know that everyone does committee meetings differently. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would just be more comfortable if the community had the opportunity. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would \nSPEAKER_05:  to hear the full motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know what our next climate action committee meeting is. I'm not trying to make like some significant delay. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Do we know when that is yet? \nSPEAKER_06:  \uc544 fathers cheers \nSPEAKER_06:  Are you on or you want to know what our next. \nSPEAKER_06:  targeting for July of next month. \nSPEAKER_05:  And when were you hoping this would be back to council? \nSPEAKER_05:  Would it be possible to do it concurrently? \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sure we can absolutely try. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would feel more comfortable. It's hard for me to support that motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  without \nSPEAKER_05:  diving in more. \nSPEAKER_05:  because it's recommending it to the council versus. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, Frank, and then you get to the council. \nSPEAKER_05:  So while I'm supportive, generally, of the aspirational goal. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would want the community to be able to provide this committee feedback on the motion as made. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  before an understanding potential things that I'm not aware of. Because, again, oil and its complexities are way beyond my \nSPEAKER_05:  regular scope of knowledge. \nSPEAKER_05:  If we were talking about something like grants or something, I could feel more comfortable serving as an expert, but I just don't know as much. \nSPEAKER_05:  from both sides. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so I'd be more comfortable. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I'd be more comfortable. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  So the motion recommends a council ask for the report back. \nSPEAKER_06:  So what you're saying is you would like the report back to come to our committee before it goes to Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  When it comes to the council, would it be coming to the council? \nSPEAKER_05:  the first time with the staff report back in the staff have spent that time and resource on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm only asking that we try to groom the ask in a meaningful way to ensure that the community has some input. \nSPEAKER_05:  on what we're asking of. \nSPEAKER_05:  the staff, I imagine. \nSPEAKER_05:  And do we have staffer on that could tell us what kind of time to mintment that is? \nSPEAKER_05:  because one of the things I've also experienced recently in my meetings with the city manager. \nSPEAKER_05:  is that \nSPEAKER_05:  I ask for things and the answer is that they have so much to do and they're so short staffed. \nSPEAKER_05:  that they can't get to some of the things we're already aspirationally asking for. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so to me, I think that there's \nSPEAKER_05:  importance in this and saving our environment and our world. \nSPEAKER_05:  and knowing where that fits in the staffs. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  structure, typically the city manager would need to let us know something like that and provide us with \nSPEAKER_05:  what the cost would be and then from that we'd be able to say \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, yes, let's add some things here or let's take some things away here so that it fits into what we're all anticipating. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, I know much of the ads comes from the Sustainable City Commission processes. \nSPEAKER_06:  that I've been going on for months. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so, and I know that community can members of ask for this in letters since last year. So what you're asking and staff and anyone, anyone chime in. So what you're asking, stay. Could I ask the question or? \nSPEAKER_05:  Could I ask a question on your recent statement? \nSPEAKER_05:  Why hasn't the city provided this sustainable city commission with what they've asked for? \nSPEAKER_05:  Is there a reason? \nSPEAKER_05:  Do we not have the expertise? Do we need to outsource it? \nSPEAKER_05:  Is it possible to get the City Manager to answer some of these questions for us? \nSPEAKER_06:  Sure, I think that would be. \nSPEAKER_05:  hopeful. Like why aren't you? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  providing it to them. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, so what you're asking, Councilman, do you want this to come back to a you want us to meet up discuss this that our next commission meeting? Is that the final week? \nSPEAKER_05:  And I would like the City Manager and or people who can answer for us. Why is the city? \nSPEAKER_05:  Commission not getting the requests that they're asking for. \nSPEAKER_05:  Why does it need to come to our committee to then go to the full city council? \nSPEAKER_05:  with this commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  as been selected by the council. \nSPEAKER_05:  approved by the council selected by the mayor. \nSPEAKER_05:  to help us and guide us and if they're asking for things. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're just going to be asking again, and we are not clear on why they're not getting what they're asking for. I think the city manager needs to be present in the answer to that. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  forever. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  and grab her. \nSPEAKER_05:  on the staff is available. \nSPEAKER_07:  Certainly council member chair council members \nSPEAKER_07:  What we'd like to do is maybe consult with the Sustainable Cities Liaison. \nSPEAKER_07:  to better understand. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great. \nSPEAKER_07:  how this request aligns with fairs. \nSPEAKER_07:  and potentially either through a TFF or \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that would be great. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  or through this coming back to you, we can unpack the motion and discuss the \nSPEAKER_07:  the extent to which the city can and can't do what the request is rather than actually \nSPEAKER_07:  Talking about the proposed recommendation, we can at least let you know what the capacity is for the departments to be able to honor that those recommendations. And Bob, you're on the line I see in Kevin. Can you speak further on that? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, sure. There was a response provided from the city manager when he asked along with the recommendations from the city's sustainable commission and it addressed. \nSPEAKER_02:  Those positions that the Sustainable City Commission asked. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I believe it was just in the in the former response from the city manager to the city council. So that has been addressed in a memo from the city manager. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so I'm confused now. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're asking for something in Bob's saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  that there is a memo that already answers it or I'm \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm so sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilwoman, it addressed the topics and laid out the steps that would be necessary. Councilwoman Chair Allen, you were cutting out a little bit up, but I assume your first point was like an amortization study. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So, in addresses the fact that it's the owner of an asset, you don't really perform an emergency study. You already know the economic life of the field. Now, what we don't know is the economics of other entities that operate within the city of Long Beach, other oil experts that are operating. So an Amritage Station study to do on our own asset really isn't necessary, but we would undertake it for other areas within the city for oil operations that are outside of the city's purview. And so we address that, we address where some of the funding that EAR currently has and the funds and projects that are supporting through there. So a lot of those were all addressed in that reply back to the Mayor's City Council. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  But we really just laid out the process and the next steps if we were to undertake something like that from if so directed by City Council. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And Bob, does it tell us the cost of what that would be? \nSPEAKER_02:  It does not go into the cost, nor does it go into time frame. But these things take several years. I know the county of Los Angeles is undertaking theirs. And theirs is that they budgeted a million dollars, but some of these other ones are anywhere from one million to five million dollars in study costs. So it is a very costly undertaking, and it is a very timely undertaking just to do that component of it. And those things weren't laid out. It would also probably work with the City Attorney's Office to look at all the legal impacts from any of these actions that are being suggested here, Princess Banna and Drillings. \nSPEAKER_00:  in steady cost. \nSPEAKER_02:  Those things would take significant resources and funding mostly through the city attorney's office though with outside I representation to address those because well and gas laws are very complex and that's typically not something that cities Trains are for that familiar with And certainly there's also remember you have other owners of the operations besides just the city You have the state of California with you would have to bring it to this question \nSPEAKER_02:  contractors and then those 6,000 or so run out to the interest owners who would also be impacted by anything. It is very, very complex and we laid out kind of some of that in that reply back to them and we are really just awaiting to see what direction the city council would provide to the response from that memo that was provided. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, that helps me better understand. I'm so sorry I was confused about the whole thing. So we're out of the book. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the motion asks the city council to direct the city manager and the city attorney to look into this report back to us for information. \nSPEAKER_05:  And could we also ask? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you all so much. \nSPEAKER_05:  for a TFF. \nSPEAKER_05:  that would provide the council with. \nSPEAKER_05:  options of areas to get funding. \nSPEAKER_05:  to pay for it, right? I mean, we want... \nSPEAKER_05:  L\u00f6sung \nSPEAKER_05:  manager or the city attorney to do it. \nSPEAKER_05:  We kind of need a scope of if they're going to cost a quarter of a mill or a half a mill or a mill. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  If so, what revenue streams are available? \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  is there any availability in that revenue stream or would we need to make a cut? And if so, what are the areas the city manager would recommend making cuts to? \nSPEAKER_05:  because there are things that \nSPEAKER_05:  are expiring that we could easily. \nSPEAKER_05:  capitalize on. \nSPEAKER_05:  but that timeline of when it expires might impact when we could start. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think we want to be very transparent with the community. \nSPEAKER_05:  about not just our goals, but \nSPEAKER_05:  the timeline and expectations, just for an example. \nSPEAKER_05:  We said we were paving student baker and we raised $8 million to do that. \nSPEAKER_05:  the community's like, well, get started. And they're like, oh, well, it's 16 million. And there's these five steps and so on and so forth. And so I just like providing the community in my newsletter. \nSPEAKER_05:  the full scope of what we're talking about to get their input, including total cost, where we get it from, why we're doing it. \nSPEAKER_05:  and why this is an aspirational goal that adds a city, especially a coastal city. \nSPEAKER_05:  should or should not take the lead on in this case I think this committee would \nSPEAKER_05:  likely recommend that we should. \nSPEAKER_05:  if there were revenues available and we. \nSPEAKER_05:  needed to if there was a way to tack on to the county plan and that was a preferred way that could save money but give the same outcomes that would be great. I just am not an expert in those areas, but I really appreciate the information and bringing it forward because I've learned a lot today and I appreciate that as well. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think that's a good councilwoman. I think that's great. I think especially with surplus revenues right now. \nSPEAKER_06:  We can look at other funding sources. So I think those are good things to add. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. I appreciate you. Yeah, of course. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. I appreciate you. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, any more discussion from my colleague? \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, so. \nSPEAKER_06:  and up. \nSPEAKER_06:  Madam Chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Madam Chair, I just wanted to say thank you for bringing this up and I think that emotion. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_14:  is it's perfect.
