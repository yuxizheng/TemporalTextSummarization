Good morning. Morning. Morning. Not afternoon or evening. Chair Rixote and members of the Budget Oversight Committee meeting. This item is a receive and file of the FY23 mid-year performance report that went to City Council on June 13th of this year. This will be a verbal staff report but in your packets you have the performance report that was posted online as well as all of the attachments. This was a mid-year performance report of the potential FY23 year-end projections. This report was based on early estimates from departments and citywide revenue analysis which we know can vary sometimes sometimes significantly by the end of the year. Actual year and status will be reported in our annual year-end performance report that comes to City Council in February. \nSPEAKER_02:  more time that afternoon or evening. \nSPEAKER_01:  first to provide context on the general fund. The city began the FY23 budget development process in the spring of 2022 with the preliminary projection of the FY23 structural shortfall of 11.9 million. The budget was then adopted in September with the projected structural shortfall of 11.1 million, which excluded the impact of the measure and litigation lawsuit at 8.5. If you include the impact of the measure and litigation lawsuit, the structural shortfall then increased to 19.6 million. Additionally, the FY23 budget included about 9 million of one-time uses. \nSPEAKER_00:  process. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  in both the structural shortfall and one time uses were slated to be covered with funds made available through the Long Beach Recovery Act and other reserves. So that was the plan, that was the 23 budget that was adopted and the journey to adopt that budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Then on March 7th of this year, staff presented to City Council the fiscal outlook and update for FY24. So now looking ahead as part of the budget development process. And if you recall the most significant part of this forecast update was a major recalibration of revenues to eliminate any remaining pandemic impact from our projections. As the actuals of FY21 and FY22, now that we were able to see that this year did not reflect the negative pandemic impact that was anticipated. Overall revenue projections for 24 at that time looking out to the future fiscal year improved by about 40 million compared to previous projections. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that affected our current year projections as well, current year being FY23. For FY23 year end, we are anticipating a similar recalibration of revenue estimates with over 40 million of revenue projection improvements compared to the adopted budget. And this excludes measure A and revenues from land sales and settlement proceeds, which are, um, \nSPEAKER_01:  considered separately. Additionally, the budgetary impact of significant vacancies throughout the city, which we first saw in FY22, from unfilled positions in an unprecedentedly tight labor market, is continuing into FY23, and we are seeing that in the estimates that the departments are providing as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  These factors combined have resulted in an FY 23 year in projection for the general fund of a 20.5 million surplus. The majority of these funds are recommended to be prioritized for highest priority projects of the Mayor and City Council, including homelessness and housing, public safety, economic development, as well as other investments in infrastructure parks, neighbourhood, livability, and other critical operation requirements. The City Manager will propose specific uses as part of the FY 24 budget for the Mayor and City Council's consideration. So when you look at the report, this report does not include specific recommendations on the uses. However, this will be part of the proposed FY 24 budget discussion that will be public in early August, coming up soon. \nSPEAKER_01:  The report also provides notable updates on other funds. For example, measure A is projecting and operating and net programs surplus of 11.1 million. And 7.5 million of these funds being allocated for uses as part of the FY24 budget. So again, you'll see that in about a month or less than a month. A couple weeks or next week, actually. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Tidlin's operating fund section discusses the impact of higher oil prices, then assumed in the budget, which results in a projected surplus with 11 million of funds also being earmarked for critical projects to be proposed as part of the FY24 budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Again, these projections for FY23 will be revisited again at the end of the year and any additional decisions can be made at that time as well depending on the final outcome of our funds and the fiscal status at that point. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this concludes my report and I am available to answer questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Are there any questions or comments from my committee members? Perhaps I'll start with you, council member Duggan. \nSPEAKER_00:  So in reading this, I understand the mayor is going to make recommendations on the specifically on the measure a reserve. I'm looking at the 11.1 million. The mayor is going to make recommendations. Where does the city manager, you also mentioned the city manager. So can you clarify that, please? Yes, absolutely. \nSPEAKER_01:  So because we are projecting that 20 million or approximately 20 million surplus in the general fund to be available at the end of this fiscal year FY 23 as part of the development of the proposed budget the city manager has included in the proposed budget Some uses of those funds recommended uses of those funds. So the city manager will be presenting that when the 24 proposed budget is released next week The mayor may also have additional recommendations to make on top which will be announced at a budget press conference \nSPEAKER_01:  In terms of the measure A funds similar to the general fund, right now we're projecting about 11 million surplus in the measure A fund. And in the proposed budget you'll see about seven and a half of that, earmarked two projects. And that will again those details will be presented with the budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  Council Member Aronga, any questions? \nSPEAKER_00:  N.J. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  I said a couple of questions. So, and this may just be from a kind of procedural standpoint. But you mentioned when we were talking about the recalibration of the revenue estimates and the $40 million of revenue projection improvements compared to the adopted budget, you mentioned that measure A and revenues from land sales and settlement proceeds are considered separately. Is there a reason for that? Is it just for standards for budgeting or is there a particular reason? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, great question. So measure A is considered separately because we do have, while technically it is general fund, legally it's just general fund. And the council has adopted a resolution of intent, which allocates measure A funds for public safety and infrastructure purposes. And so we do track the revenue that comes in related to measure A separately, and the uses are documented separately. And we do also have a Citizens Advisory Committee that also reviews that as well to make sure we are in line with the resolution of intent. So that we don't, when I said it's taken out of the equation, whenever you see that in the report, that's really to reference, we don't want those dollars commingling with what we want to report as being the status of the broader general fund. If the measure is having a surplus, we kind of have that surplus conversation separately. As opposed to saying there's general surplus for other uses that general fund would allow. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other comment was more just to mention that sometimes we get additional revenues that come in that looks like our revenues are coming in higher, but they might be like pass-through. So for example, we had $7.5 million of a settlement payment from a class action lawsuit against the Monsanto company. So our revenues will show an increase of $7.5, but those are for restricted purposes according to the lawsuit. And so that gets mixed in with the numbers. So what we try to do is scrub that a little bit, and when we say the projections improved by $40 million, that's sort of isolating those pieces that are not measured and those significant one-time revenues that are more like a pass-through. \nSPEAKER_01:  fantastic. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then just follow up. I don't think I've seen this. \nSPEAKER_02:  breakdown before and it's just its particular interest. Could you walk us through table 3 just the Long Beach Recovery Act funding sources? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, so the Long Beach Recovery Act was started when we received the ARPA funds, the American Rescue Plan, but the plan that the city put together is not just based on the funding from ARPA. So the ARPA funds is a portion of it, but the whole plan that was put together by the city and adopted by City Council and has been being implemented over the past couple years is a combination of both ARPA funding or funds, now general funds, made available because of ARPA funding, plus many other grants. So Table 3 is listing the various different grants that you can see here that makes the Long Beach Recovery Act plan as high as almost 300 million. Even though the ARPA fund, if you just look in isolation, was a much smaller amount, this gives that outline. So the LBR section in the Performance Report just gives a brief status update of where we are at that time, and the Recovery Act team puts out regular communication and they have a website and a dashboard that gives more up-to-date information on both the funding and the operating side of the Long Beach Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so the amount that we're looking at in Table 3 is the total amount that's allocated to each of these sources, but that's separate from the money that's actually been expenditures that might be part of each of those buckets. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's correct. This is the entire plan and not necessarily the pace of the spending. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great, thank you so much. And then one last question. So how does table three relate to, just so I'm clear, to table four? \nSPEAKER_02:  are these kind of funding sources collapsed into the program category? You guys want to make sure I understand. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so exactly to the question that you asked before. Table three is the sources. So where are we getting the money to fund the Long Beach Recovery Act plan? And then table four, if you look at the first column, it says that 296.6, you'll see that that's the same as table three, the 296.6. So that is, again, it shows you the plan now broken out into the three major categories, economic recovery, healthy and safe community, and securing our city's future. And then the following columns that you'll see just shows the status of actual spending in the different fiscal years, which was exactly the question you were asking before. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  and test it. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I had one. \nSPEAKER_02:  framtidiga s\u00e5 kom sigue med en resa hemma. \nSPEAKER_02:  Nope, that was it. Great, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  any additional questions from my council colleagues. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing none, we can go to public comments. So anyone who would like to address us on the agenda item through public comment, can please approach the podium now. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think we can, oh, do we, I didn't take a motion yet. We didn't do a motion, right? Can I get a motion from my? \nSPEAKER_02:  First and second is it working? \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe it's working out. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe it's right. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, we have a first and a second. Any additional comments? \nSPEAKER_02:  See now, we can go ahead and vote."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  CAR world. \nSPEAKER_01:  wonderful. I'll come to the next item red. \nSPEAKER_00:  recommendation to receive and file an update on CalPERS and the city's pension costs. \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe their presentation on this one as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes we do. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good morning again. This presentation is to provide an overview of CalPERS and the city's pension costs. \nSPEAKER_00:  I will go over a high level overview of CalPERS and the various changes made to the plan over the past few years. Talk about our unfunded liability and history, discuss the impact of investment returns, given overview of our current city rates, and how all of this ties into our budget status and forecast for pension costs. \nSPEAKER_00:  The CalPERS retirement system is a defined benefit plan as opposed to a defined contribution plan. This means there is a fixed pre-established benefit for employees at retirement based on a formula that considers your salary, years of service, age, and the benefit plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  versus a defined contribution plan is a plan that allows you to save and invest a portion of your income for your retirement and then what you have at retirement really depends on how much you save, how well the investments perform and how you withdraw that money. \nSPEAKER_00:  The fiscal and actuarial goal of our CalPERS plan is to ensure that there are enough funds accumulated to pay for the benefits. And to this end, CalPERS works to pre-fund the plans in order to have enough funds for those retiree benefits. \nSPEAKER_00:  So these plans are funded through three main sources, member contributions, employer contributions, and CalPERS investment earnings. The main focus of this presentation will be on the things that have impacted the employer contributions, as that is what we are talking about, when we talk about city pension costs in our budget discussions, it's really what it costs the employer for this. And what is our share of the cost to fund the retirement benefits? \nSPEAKER_00:  Over the past years, there have been many changes implemented by CalPERS that have impacted our employer contribution rates. \nSPEAKER_00:  CalPERS has implemented several changes to its investment strategy and expected return, designed to address the plan's unfunded liabilities and to ensure its long-term fiscal sustainability. \nSPEAKER_00:  So first, CalPERS adopted changes to its amortization and rate smoothing policy, which first impacted our FY 16 budget. The previous amortization and smoothing policy that was in place helped local governments better plan their budgets, because it avoided these large volatility in rates by smoothing out the impact of what actually happened in the market. But it did contribute to the underfunding of the city's pension plans. The new rate smoothing approach is intended to eliminate the city's unfunded liability, but it does expose the city to higher volatility in annual costs. And I'll talk about that in future slides. \nSPEAKER_00:  Second, CalPERS also changed demographic assumptions, which began to impact our FY17 budget. And these are assumptions such as mortality rates, and it reflected the population is living longer, which is good news, but from a pension, actuarial fiscal perspective, they consider it bad news, collecting pension benefits over a longer period of time, because of people who are doing that. This resulted in increased cost to more accurately reflect pensions paid to retirees over a longer period of time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Third, the board adopted a new risk mitigation strategy, which was originally slated to impact the FY18 budget. \nSPEAKER_00:  the board felt that their current investment strategy was too volatile with too much risk. And so the risk mitigation strategy was implemented to slowly over time make the city's investment mix more conservative. So the way that this approach worked was really to move to a more conservative mix only when the investment returns were a lot better than expected to help mitigate some of the hit to the city. So instead of just getting the benefit of a really good investment year instead of decreasing our contribution rates the plan was they would just knock down the investment mix portfolio to be a little less risky and take care of the cost that way. \nSPEAKER_00:  Then in December 2016, CalPERS voted to lower the actuarially assumed investment rate. We also call this the discount rate from what was then the 7.5% to 7% over three years. With the first year impacting our FY19 rate, so we're getting a little closer to our current history. And this was done to reflect the expectation of a lower rate of return over time predicted by CalPERS investment advisors. So they were saying 7.5 is too high. So essentially CalPERS does not assume a zero return in their calculations. They are assuming at baseline we're going to get 7.5% or they were. And so anytime we do better than 7.5%, that's considered a gain, whatever over the 7.5 is. But if we had a positive investment return of 6%, that actually would be considered a loss. Because they were already assuming we were going to get 7.5%. So that was the discussion there. That 7.5 was too high and that it needed to go down to 7% over three years. \nSPEAKER_00:  The full impact of this change was realized in FY21 when the discount rate finally reached 7%. \nSPEAKER_00:  Then in 2018, CalPERS adopted changes to their amortization policy again. Before investment gains or losses were amortized over 30 years, but this changed shortened that period to 20 years. So just the takeaway here is generally longer amortization periods provide for a lower contribution rate that we have to pay. But it does have higher overall costs due to interest over time. The shorter amortization period reduces our total interest paid over time, but it does increase the employer contribution rates in the short term as a result. So this change affected our FY22 rates. \nSPEAKER_00:  Finally, in 2021, there was a new demographic study. CalPERS does this every four years. They do a demographic study that updated the assumptions on mortality rates and age. And also, the discount rate was lowered from the seven that I mentioned before to 6.8. That 0.2% decrease was due to the risk mitigation strategy because we had a very good investment year for the year ending 6.3021. And so they used that and notched down our discount rate a little bit. So that is now reflected in our proposed FY24 budget, which will come out in a week, which rates assume a 6.8 discount rate. \nSPEAKER_00:  To address the challenges of rising pension costs, several pension reforms and initiatives have been implemented by the city and state. Without these proactive initiatives, the city situation would have been much worse. In 2006, the city lowered benefit formulas for miscellaneous employees and also through negotiations with partnership of our bargaining groups. And by FY14, all employees began paying their full employee contribution rate, which had previously been subsidized by the city. We had called that the purers pick up, but now employees are just paying their full contribution rate. \nSPEAKER_00:  Then Pepper was passed by the state, which implemented new benefit formulas and new contribution requirements for employees hired on or after January 1, 2013. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then in FY 14, the city created and funded what we called back then a CalPERS stabilization fund. This fund was an innovative approach to addressing some of the challenges we had with budgeting and planning. And to address the potentially significant pension cost fluctuations year over year due to all of the CalPERS changes that I had mentioned before. \nSPEAKER_00:  This fund, however, was discontinued when the risk mitigation approach was adopted by CalPERS because it made it unlikely in the way that we had structured the plan that it would be able to be replenished. The way that it was originally envisioned. \nSPEAKER_00:  Then in 2017, the city made the decision to make an early payment towards the unfunded liability portion for FY18. And this was done again in FY19 and 20. The lump sum payments was discontinued in FY21 over concerns on cash flow. We did bring it back in 22 and that does generate some savings because we're paying \nSPEAKER_00:  a faster to calpers lump sum at the beginning of the year or in July, the beginning of their fiscal year in July, and then they charge us a little bit less for the unfunded liability portion of our plan, which again I'll also talk about in future slides. We are not doing this for the proposed FY24 budget, however, as our city treasury yields are higher than the discounted rate the city would be credited by pre-paying. So in other words, we're making more money just by keeping the funds and paying it on the timing of when it's due versus paying it all for the year in July. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this is something our Treasury team helps us evaluate each year and we'll evaluate each year whether it makes more sense to do the lump sum and get the savings that way or to just pay on the monthly basis. \nSPEAKER_00:  Lastly, as part of labor negotiations, additional PERS pickups were agreed upon for safety groups. The classic police and sworn managers agreed to pick up 3% in 2019. Lifeguards and marine safety picked up an additional 2% in 2021 and fire an additional 3% in 2023. So again, similar to the PERS pickup reform before, these additional pickups help reduce the city's cost paid for pension. Because one were the other out of those 3 buckets, we're trying to fund our cost employee, employer, or the rest via investment returns. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that summarizes some of the history and context on the things that have impacted the city's pension cost or our employer contribution rate. But I did wanna talk a little bit about what exactly makes up the employer contribution rate. I alluded to this, but the rate is made up of two parts. One is called the normal cost, and that is the annual cost associated with one year of service accrual. So that would just be in a normal year how much benefit you're earning within that year for your pension plan. The other part is the unfunded liability, or the portion of the rate that makes up for any gains or losses in the plan that deviates from our expectation. So another way to think about it is if everything worked out exactly as CalPERS in the city predicts the same number of FTEs, the salary, the mortality rate, then we would only have the normal cost. But that's clearly never ever been the case. And so our rates are always, and any deviation from expectation that weight is put on the employer contribution rate, the employee contribution rate doesn't fluctuate, that's sort of set. So that is why in our rates, we have the normal and unfunded liability portion that is always making up part of our costs. \nSPEAKER_00:  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the city's pension plan was actually super funded. This means there was sufficient money in CalPERS fund to cover all of the benefits for current employees and retirees at that time. So if that status had continued, basically that means the city would never have had to make another contribution to the plan again. But a couple changes happened around that time. One, the enhanced benefit formulas were added for miscellaneous and safety plans, so things got more expensive. And secondly, CalPERS at that time was assuming investment returns of 8.25 and that was too high. So we're now at 6.8 compared to that 8.25. So we've changed investment assumptions quite a bit since that's where CalPERS has \nSPEAKER_00:  But the real big thing was 2009 when the market crashed, where in 2008, the assets earned a negative 5%. \nSPEAKER_00:  and then a negative 24% in 2009, the city experienced significant losses in our pension assets and our funded status declined sharply. Additionally, the asset smoothing method used at that time kept our costs low, which again, as I mentioned on one hand, was helpful from a budgetary planning perspective, but ultimately what that meant was we were not contributing enough into the funds to repay the losses. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now, however, with all the recent changes from CalPERS, including changes to the asset smoothing method, we're on a path towards paying down our unfunded liability, building up our funded status, and again, with the trade-offs being higher cost for the city, especially over the past few years. That has been a pretty significant cost driver for our general fund. \nSPEAKER_00:  In terms of timing, the city's contribution rates are partially determined by investment earnings three years prior. For example, the investment earnings returns ending June 30th, 2021 will primarily impact our city's FY24 rates. So there is that lag of performance of the market and then what fiscal year those market performances show up when CalPERS gives us our rates or what we owe. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the discounted rate, expected discounted rate is 6.8, as I mentioned for FY 24. Again, that is assuming we'll learn at least 6.8 in the market and anything less than 6.8, even if it's positive above zero is considered a loss. \nSPEAKER_00:  The positive returns of June 30, 2021 have really improved our rates for FY 24, but not fully because of the risk mitigation methodology, where we drop that 7 to the 6.8. \nSPEAKER_00:  even so that 6.30-21 return being so high and positive at 21.3. The General Fund this year for 24 projections is showing a savings in our CalPERS line for the first time in many, many years. So that's the good news. The bad news is a year later, the investment return ending 6.30-22 was a negative 7.5. So again, that volatility from a 21.3 positive now to a negative 7.5 loss, which is actually more than 7.5 because we're already assuming a 6.8 gain. We'll impact the out-your-forecast starting in FY25 to be losses again, or our increased cost in our pension versus savings. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this slide just to illustrate what I was talking about shows us the potential impact that investment returns have on our contribution rate as a result of all of the changes. The CalPERS is made that makes the city's contribution more sensitive to investment earnings. The table on the left, this whole chart, they're all just hypothetical scenarios, so this isn't our real scenario, but it's just to paint a picture and exercise that we did with our actuary consultants a couple years ago. \nSPEAKER_00:  but it shows three hypothetical scenarios. One is moderate and then the other is good if we did very positive returns and the other is if we had bad returns. So based on these hypothetical scenario assumptions, the line graph chart shows the potential contribution payments that CalPERS would charge us to pay the normal and unfunded costs and you can see just all the different variants that are there. This provides a visual illustration of the significant impact of a good or bad year of investments that can have on the trajectory of costs. So in real life, we have to monitor this each year and recalibrate what the forecast looks like again because of the recent changes that CalPERS has made that helps fund the unfunded liability but also makes our rates a lot more volatile. \nSPEAKER_00:  This table on the slide reflects the employer contribution rates as a percentage of payroll for miscellaneous and safety groups. And you can see they're broken out into different categories as they have different contribution rates for the latest negotiations. \nSPEAKER_00:  What you see here, what I want to point out is you can see the rates are anticipated to increase until they peak in FY31. So that's our projection. And while these rates are high and could present serious funding issues, they are and have been helping us put us on track to pay down our large unfunded liabilities and be in a better fiscal position. This slide also shows that the employees have required contribution rates and provides information on their rates, both for classic employees and pepper employees. \nSPEAKER_00:  The total general fund budget for pension costs is 113 million and 196 million for all funds. And for the proposed 24 budgets, again, you will see pension costs reflecting as savings compared to last year's budget for the first time in years. That's that 3.4 million. That's not our pension budget, that's just the incremental change that our cost got cheaper by 3.4 million just due to rate changes. However, again, as I mentioned before, as a result of that negative 7.5 return from 6.30 to 22, you'll see that costs are expected to increase in the future. And so you'll see all of those negative numbers starting from FY25 and beyond that negative 5.7 is a hit. The costs are going to be increasing. And this is what we say, one of our deficit drivers. So again, when we're looking at our budget, we're making a forecast always on how our cost increasing year over year without adding any services, our revenues increasing and we take the increment and we compare. Is our revenue is growing, but is it growing fast enough to cover increases like this? And if it's not, then we're in a shortfall situation. \nSPEAKER_00:  So in conclusion, increased pension costs will continue to be a deficit driver in our projections for some time until we hit the peak in FY31, after which the amounts we paid a calpers should start declining. The upsides again of these increased costs is that the city is paying down the unfunded accrued liability. \nSPEAKER_00:  In any given year, rates may fluctuate significantly as they are very sensitive to investment returns. And staff will continue to evaluate CalPERS costs annually and throughout the year to incorporate costs into the forecast and into any strategic planning discussion. So this concludes my presentation and available for questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. That was great actually. Before we start discussion can I get a motion of first and second? \nSPEAKER_01:  It worked this time. Any questions from Council Member Aronka or Council Member Duggan? \nSPEAKER_01:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, that's a great presentation. I'm going to have to go for it again, because that's a lot of information. \nSPEAKER_02:  But one question I do have. So this is, you've done a lot of projections. Tell me again, explain what current rates are valued at. We talked about 21, and then 22, we have that negative 6.1. Is it 6.1%? Yes, 6.1%. \nSPEAKER_02:  As we move through this, is it a moving 12 month or 24 month? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so there's about, it's like a little bit, like two and a half, three year delay of an investment return earning and then the fiscal year that it affects our city. It's also a little bit one extra layer of complication is that CalPERS is on a July to June fiscal year and we're on October to September. So that, um, \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, we have like majority of, for example, the 630-2021 investment return. So back in 2021, affects mostly our FY24 rates. But three months out of that will affect our FY23. That's just the fiscal year difference. But that's, you can see the time difference there from the investment return outcome in 2021. Effects are FY24 rates. So that's why the positive 21.3 return back then is good news for our 24 budget. \nSPEAKER_00:  But we already know our June 30th 2022 return, which was a negative 7.5, is going to affect our 25 rates that we get from CalPERS a couple years out. \nSPEAKER_02:  it will affect 25 for \nSPEAKER_02:  most of the time. Yes. According to this. That's right. Yeah, three minds of twins. And then we'll be assessed. Okay. That's correct. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's right. Yeah, three minds of 20 \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. I think that's it for now. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  a couple of questions for me. So on slide seven, when you talk about the city, was super funded back in the late 90s and early 2000s, can you just go over what super funded means again? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, definitely. That means that when the CalPERS actuary did their analysis, they were saying the amount of funding that we've already put in the plan because it's all pre-funded was enough to cover whatever they were calculating the liability to be. So there is always a liability that the city has. It may not be unfunded liability because if we fund everything, our liability is covered. So essentially they were saying \nSPEAKER_00:  Whatever they're projecting, we will owe retirees over, you know, this number of retirees with their salaries with their benefit earnings that we had enough in there. Now, hindsight is 2020. It's always a loaded. \nSPEAKER_00:  perspective, but you can see the calculation back then if they were assuming, oh, we're going to get 8.25 every year. \nSPEAKER_00:  If that's not accurate, then even though the statement was we were super funded or were funded, \nSPEAKER_00:  In reality, we may not be when we get to the point of, you know, actually having to cash out. As well as then the city also said, oh great, we're super funded. Let's negotiate a better plan. So the plan also got more expensive, a better formula. \nSPEAKER_00:  for employees. And so all of those things then change the super funding status with the biggest coming in 2009 when we had a lot of cash or a lot of assets in the plan. And in that case, ironically, that hurt us more because we had more to lose with the market crash and then had a bigger gap of now our liabilities, more of our liabilities being unfunded liabilities than funded. \nSPEAKER_01:  Understood. Okay. And so just to clarify so that means super funded basically means we didn't have any unfunded liability because at the time we had enough funds in the system in order to Assuming we had the 8.25% and everything else understood and then we had the market crash and then after that is when the risk mitigation strategies came in to help address some of that Liat the volatility so that we could plan better from a budgetary standpoint \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, the risk mitigation was more for CalPERS to lower the investment mix to be less risky. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then the volatility is still in effect. Like as that one chart that I showed, we are now very sensitive to investment returns in terms of what CalPERS will recognize, which from a funding perspective, it's actually better because what I was explaining before, but it might have been a little bit convoluted is prior to all of these changes. \nSPEAKER_00:  If the market did really well or the market did really bad, CalPERS would essentially only recognize a portion of it. That was their smoothing methodology. Is each year, if you had like a 20% loss, we're gonna make it seem like you only had a 1% loss. And over 20 years, we'll acknowledge that there was a loss in that one year. And so over the years, that can accumulate where, \nSPEAKER_00:  you're just not funding enough into the plan because they're not actually recognizing the market loss and that was one of the reforms that happened earlier on. So that's \nSPEAKER_01:  the amateurization portion you were talking about. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, great. And then just remind me one more time about how the funding ratio was calculated. \nSPEAKER_01:  or the funded ratio should say. \nSPEAKER_00:  on this slide. So they look at our liability and then our assets. And just it's a simple ratio of do our assets cover our liability. And after 2009 we were like around the 60 or 70 percent, which actually was bad for us but there were some other agencies that \nSPEAKER_00:  were a lot lower like under 50. I don't think we ever fell below 50% funded. That's what the funded ratio essentially means. It's how much assets do we have compared to our actual liability? \nSPEAKER_01:  great. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then on slide nine, I know these are hypothetical, but you can you just walk us through the table of the \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm gonna get this up with a commodity good bad like what that is supposed to be indicating to us just walk through that table. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, sure. So, the moderate, and if you see, is the middle blue line, in that case, let's say it took into consideration the 21.3% a good return in 2021. \nSPEAKER_00:  Or these percentages that you see on the table, you can consider are the hypothetical investment returns that's affecting our rates. So if we start with everyone having a good investment return in 2021, and then you go to the second row in fiscal year 2021-22, which is our fiscal year 22, moderate is, let's say, just a 3% investment return. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good investment return, let's say we gained 6.8% in that scenario. And a bad one is we had a loss of 3%. So you can see as you go down that table, moderate, \nSPEAKER_00:  Moving forward is just assuming 6.8% for all of the other out years. Good is just a hypothetical mix of 10, 8, 6.87, and bad is 35, 6.87. So it's just kind of a random, what would it look like if these were our investment rates returns? What would CalPERS actually charge us in those fiscal years? So then now you go to the line chart. \nSPEAKER_00:  In the middle line, the middle blue line shows you a visual representation of what we would be owing CalPERS. You know, these are the dollar numbers converted from back table rates. \nSPEAKER_00:  But if you look at the good scenario, the green, we have less expenses. And then when you look at the bad, the bad actually swings up even higher than the good. So it kind of shows that the bad because of the risk mitigation hits us worse than the good helps us. That's just a small visual representation here. But the big takeaway you could make is how volatile it is. I mean, we could be in a scenario. These percentages don't seem like ridiculous, right? These things, these investment returns seem within the realm of possibility. When we did the scenario, we weren't like making up like 50% return or negative 50. But just, I think the takeaway is here is within these very slight investment return outcomes, we could be in three very different scenarios of costs as it relates to our pension. That makes sense. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now, how does this, or maybe these don't connect, but how does these scenarios connect with the following slide talking about the contribution rates? Because I know you said there was a peak in fiscal year 31 and then it starts to decrease. Is that what we're seeing here in this slide? Because I see that the red and the blue projections eventually combine together and then it kind of moves out in the out years. Is that related to this expectation around the peak rates? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, that's a great question. So yes, the hypothetical scenario follows the general trajectory, the city is on, which is we have been since 09 and all of the changes that CalPERS have made, putting a lot of money back into the pension plan. And that broader plan that CalPERS has us on to put a lot more of our city's costs into pensions. In some years, it was like 10 million increase in the general plan for like three years in a row. So it was a significant cost driver. All of that is eventually putting us in a place where we will be able to slow down that rate of increase of money into the CalPERS plan. And that's what this is showing. Now you have paid enough of your unfended liability. You have a big enough asset that's covering our liabilities that we can sort of pump the brakes and lower our costs. So the hypothetical chart is also reflecting that. The actual projections we have here. \nSPEAKER_00:  is we work with our actuary consultant to do these forecasts. They're not based on those hypothetical investment returns that we talked about before, but a mix of what we know already, we already know because it's three years out that delay of investment returns. We already know what the return is for 22. We have a good sense. I think CalPERS just recently announced what they think the, \nSPEAKER_00:  preliminary investment return is for 23, I think it was like a 5.8%. So that can be factored into our projections for 25 and 26. And then for the out years, we can use the stable assumed rate of return with some work that we do with our actuary that makes it a little bit more nuanced. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, so that makes sense. Then basically saying if we do okay, basically kind of the moderate scenario for the next, let's say five to ten years, right, then we end up lowering our rates sooner after that peak. But if God forbid something like 2008 happens again, then that changes the, the, the accruals that we have and then projections that you're not providing us. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then just a clarification for me, what are pepper employees? I don't know, I'm not familiar with that acronym. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so Pepparat was the state reform that happened. I believe it was 2012. Let me just find that page. Yes, it was passed by the state and it stands for Public Employees Pension Reform Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, it was. \nSPEAKER_00:  that's PEPRA and so what they did there was for, so we call them PEPRA. If you were hired on after, is it hired on or after January 1, 2013. Prior to that, if you were part of the CalPERSystem, your term is classic. So you'll hear that terminology when we talk about pensions. Are you a classic employee? No, I'm a PEPRA employee. Oh, so sorry. If you are a PEPRA employee, you are formula, if you're miscellaneous, is 2% at 62. And if you're safety, you're 2.7 at 57. \nSPEAKER_01:  January 1st, 2020. \nSPEAKER_00:  So it is a \nSPEAKER_00:  cheaper formula. This is why it's reformed, but it's a worser benefit. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So we're for the UC system. So we have the we have also have it's a public pension system So we also have the 2013 we just don't we didn't we will have a special term for those folks But we do know that if you were hired 2013 is the same thing like oh, well, you know, it is what it is Okay, thank you \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I think that's it. So this is great. Um, any council member, Ranga. \nSPEAKER_03:  Nevertheless, the last discussion. \nSPEAKER_03:  That was very close to me because... \nSPEAKER_03:  Hey, got caught. \nSPEAKER_03:  in between that every time in 2013. \nSPEAKER_03:  But yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  We were trying to use it to prepare for our meat. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that was a classic employee of the 20 years of service already. So when I joined the reason with it because I retired, \nSPEAKER_03:  But we gotta take counsel. \nSPEAKER_03:  with a mean \nSPEAKER_03:  We're really hired. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that's where I was. \nSPEAKER_03:  like Karate be\u5c0f\u5fc3 like Karate be\u0440\u0443\u0437 However what classy \nSPEAKER_03:  So anyway, here I got you a little bit for me. I'm good. Have a yay! \nSPEAKER_03:  \ub124\ub180 \nSPEAKER_03:  So, my career obviously was with employees and contributions. And all this discussion about \nSPEAKER_03:  We're going to find him. I'll find it. \nSPEAKER_03:  We were at with, we got the budgets, I was getting, you know, it'll take care of employees in regards to \nSPEAKER_03: \u957f\u05d9\u05d1 underground \uc774 \ud30c\uad00\uc774 \nSPEAKER_03:  Where you get out of it? \nSPEAKER_03:  and it's really close to the negotiations. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Where we at? \nSPEAKER_03:  Please, part. \nSPEAKER_03:  Miss Radio, just a pri d \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't like the recombinance lady, I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is Colin Moyes. \nSPEAKER_03:  I want to \nSPEAKER_03:  to go and shake good contracts, whatever it tells. \nSPEAKER_03:  But, we're looking at. \nSPEAKER_03:  What you gotta do is clearly be. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd be right out of the way to say what he'd present. \nSPEAKER_03:  \ubb50\uc9c0? \ubb50\uc9c0? \uac00\ub9ac\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4? \nSPEAKER_03:  I got to read you right right now, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so for miscellaneous, it's 8% for classic. So for classic employees, miscellaneous are 8%. For most of public safety, it's 12%. And lifeguards and marine safety are 11. That's for classic. For Peppa employees, they are required to pay half of what is calculated to be their normal cost. And that might change every year or so. And right now, currently for miscellaneous, it's 8%. So similar to same as classic. And then for safety, it's 13.25%. \nSPEAKER_00:  is their employee contribution rate. \nSPEAKER_03:  So you guys, keep it. \nSPEAKER_00:  party. \nSPEAKER_03:  And there you have a job, keep it. \nSPEAKER_00:  No. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't see it anyway. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  The other thing I was concerned about was that \nSPEAKER_03:  because of the contributions. \nSPEAKER_03:  either potential that could be a decrease or the next. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think you were into 2020, maybe. \nSPEAKER_03:  Maybe if we read an increase, we wouldn't honor the protections twenty-five employees. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, no, that's a great question. So if there are the gains and losses to our plans, like I talked about before, anything different than expectation, all of the gains, but also all of the losses are then born on the employer contribution rate. So the employee contribution rate does not fluctuate. For example, like during these years where we had those pretty significant increases because of the, when the changes that CalPERS made to their plans first came out, the classic employee's contribution rate still stayed at 8% for miscellaneous. For example, it just stayed steady. \nSPEAKER_00:  The PEPRA employees, however, as I said, it is always, the state legislation is that it's always 50% of normal costs. Normal costs, though, tends to stay pretty steady. It does go up, it does go down a little, but it's the unfunded liability. That's the more volatile piece of our city's contribution rate. But for PEPRA employees, it is that formula of half of the normal cost. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, that's what I'm going to take you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  any additional comments from my council colleagues. \nSPEAKER_01:  saying none, we can go to public comment. \nSPEAKER_01:  Do we have anyone on the chamber who would like to address the committee on this agenda item? \nSPEAKER_01:  seen none. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we can go ahead and do a vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  to cheer McDonalds to thoughtful and boys out here in North Africa with another smart\ud558\uba74 carnival with some eucalypt group trainees in stats of the same height and approaches for more music on modern becomes a more beautiful urban African city warrior from the Cuierch pilot people black pilot \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Give me a second, my screen is not cooperating. \nSPEAKER_02:  We can take a verb of e-like. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're good. \nSPEAKER_00:  The motion is carried."
