If Taylor can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, I can, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I can hear you. So the minutes don't, I remembered after I got home that Commissioner Shotwell had previously told me he wouldn't be at the August meeting, he would be on vacation. And the minutes don't show an excused absence. And I'm hearing that that may not be required anymore to show it as excused or unexcused. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would still do it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so then I would like to amend the August minutes to reflect that Commissioner Schott will had an excused absence. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, you can make a motion to that effect. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that we amend the August minutes to reflect that Commissioner Shotwell had an excused absence. \nSPEAKER_00:  I move it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Does anyone else have any changes they'd like to see made or think need to be made in the minutes? \nSPEAKER_01:  see are there any public comments and our minutes from August? Seeing then can we call the vote please? \nSPEAKER_01:  We can't log in so you can have to roll call us. \nSPEAKER_00:  My apologies. That's okay.

The COI amendments for today's item are to add the police oversight commission and the commission for women and girls. These commissions are being added pursuant to the FPPC regulation that requires bodies that make substantive recommendations that are approved without significant amendments by another public official or government agency to be included in a local conflict of interest code. And these will be added to the city manager department's code. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then lastly upon further discussion regarding the CIO amendment process with Monique moving forward We won't be submitting like name changes of existing bodies or departments to the Commission for review such as removing The citizen police complaint commission because it's being replaced by the police oversight commission And with that that concludes our report and we're available for any questions.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  training program for AB 1234 compliance. \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh wait, I was supposed to announce the other one. The prior motion passed. Yes, thank you. I'm so used to the electronic system. OK. \nSPEAKER_01:  and chair, I'll be presenting on this one as well. So pretty much we just wanted to provide you a brief update that FPPC will be discontinuing their online ethics training program as of January 1st of next year due to lack of funding to support the increased demand for the program. And we are currently using their free training for elect officials and commissioners to comply with the state's AB1234 ethics training requirement. So our office will be working with Taylor and Heather to create a new training program through the city's learn LMS based on the state's training requirements. And so we'll work to complete that by the end of this year to start implementing at the beginning of next year once the FPP training programs discontinued. And with that, that concludes our report. And we are available for any questions. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, did you say that the state is not fun? Oh, sorry, can you use your mic? Here, it makes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh, sorry, can you use your mic? Your mic's not. \nSPEAKER_06:  Did you say the state is not funding education regarding 1234? \nSPEAKER_01:  So what they notified us that it was the FPPC saw additional funding for anticipated increased resources required to administer the online training. And then the Department of Finance declined to allocate the additional funding because the FPPC wasn't legally required to provide the training curriculum. \nSPEAKER_01:  And this was just like a service they offered with, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office and the Institute for Local Government that they collaborated with to create the training program. \nSPEAKER_06:  But I mean, do you know is there anything going on in Sacramento to try to \nSPEAKER_06:  make funding for this. \nSPEAKER_06:  and let us talk about for one, but I'm talking about for the whole state. \nSPEAKER_01:  yet not that I'm aware of and this was like due to there's another law that went to effect I think \nSPEAKER_01:  Last year, which amended one of the government codes include additional members for school districts, board of education and charter school boards beginning in January of 2025. So based on that, they needed additional funding for the technical support and additional demand for the training program. And they made requests to the state. And what they have communicated to us was that request was denied. So moving forward, all local agencies will be kind of on their own to create their own programs or kind of find another solution for that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there a overall resource that you know already that's ready to provide this? \nSPEAKER_01:  No, so this was the only online kind of like free training. Prior to this training that's offered, our office had like a work, I think the city attorney's office created a video that was that commissioners and elected officials previously used for the training and sometimes I think it was potentially online but then also we would have like commissioners or elected officials come to our office and to like sit and actually just watch the video on a computer for the two hours for their training to complete the requirement for the ethics training. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the institute, this is Taylor, the institute of local government has AB1234 training. The problem with that training is I believe it's like $40 or $50 a person. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right. Well, I have a lot of confidence in our staff to develop this based on how \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I think they have handled the ethics training, which I had an opportunity to take just recently. But it's very basic. It's just about the... \nSPEAKER_06:  values that we have and the \nSPEAKER_06:  the code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm very concerned about this at the state level and that's not what we're here to. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't have jurisdiction over that, but \nSPEAKER_06:  I do hope that somehow there'll be some... \nSPEAKER_06:  quality and uniformity across the state. \nSPEAKER_06:  on this and that it doesn't fall on the back of local government to figure out how to do it. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's all. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  But even... \nSPEAKER_03:  Knowing. \nSPEAKER_03:  the quality of the training materials that \nSPEAKER_03:  the staff prepared for ethics. It was a half hour. \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe AB 1-2-3-4 is two hours. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  It's two hours, right? Required. And also, I know Taylor, you had sent me the email from FPCC because I was concerned about this issue. And it seems that one of their issues was the administration of the training. So it's also providing the home base for the training, recording the training, making sure all the people are properly recorded, et cetera. But creating two hours of training every city in the state, creating two hours of training. But the alternative being $50 times $5,000. \nSPEAKER_03:  people for the just for the city of Wong Beach is crazy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are any of the cities talking about other alternatives to have, you know, some externally created training that we could get for less per person? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  You're looking at me, vice chair, so not that I know of yet. \nSPEAKER_05:  Taylor's down here. No. I can't look at her. Taylor, we're already fine. We're just fine. Just eat her. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're always fine. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just point up to the sky. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm right now working with Philip in the clerk's office to \nSPEAKER_04:  mitigate this as much as we can and be on top of it. \nSPEAKER_04:  As of right now to our knowledge. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Institute of Local Government is the only \nSPEAKER_04:  other training module that's available. The FPVC does have their content. \nSPEAKER_04:  available online. So we are able to \nSPEAKER_04:  red line what they've already done which puts us in a better position than having to create it from scratch but \nSPEAKER_04:  Your impressions are correct. This is a very heavy lift for staff to come up with this training and then. \nSPEAKER_04:  update the training, which is I think we're part of the problem is coming from FPC. \nSPEAKER_04:  their current training is really out of date. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. Especially in light of changes with the Levin Act, like transparency and ethics continues to be. \nSPEAKER_04:  As you all know, so very important. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the law keeps changing every year, which means the presentation needs to be changed. \nSPEAKER_04:  annually. So \nSPEAKER_04:  We're looking at ways to make the information more digestible. Two hours is a really long time to sit and digest information. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're looking at maybe breaking it into smaller modules to make it easier for commissioners to get it done. \nSPEAKER_04:  over time. \nSPEAKER_04:  rather than having to carve out a two hour chunk in their day. So if you all hear anything, we're open. \nSPEAKER_04:  But I think as of right now the impression is that we're all on the same \nSPEAKER_04:  kind of thinking ship. \nSPEAKER_04:  trying to paddle. \nSPEAKER_04:  to figure this out before the end of the year. \nSPEAKER_04:  on top of all of the other trainings that we're trying to get off the ground for ethics. So, this was, the timing is not great. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sure, if I may just add also the conversation, I kind of sent the general just that a factor with the kind of what's going on. So I think maybe one option could be to at least memorize your understanding on the issue of lack of funding could be to make work to create a letter. And then we could send it to representatives of the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's exactly what I was thinking, but let's go to Commissioner Shotwell first. \nSPEAKER_02:  I was I was going to recommend the same thing. Somehow if we want to think if we should voice our concern directly to the FBPC and if that has to come for if that can come from the commission or if it needs to come from the city or if it be stronger if it came from the city and we may also be able to ban with other cities. \nSPEAKER_07:  Somehow it woah. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think it would be stronger if it came from us as a commission and the FPPC has to make the funding request of the legislature. So I think it would be best if we sent a letter to Senator Gonzales and Assemblymember Lowenthal. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do we have another assembly member? Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  So, this is yours. \nSPEAKER_04:  So it would need to be a recommendation to the City Council and then the City Council would need to act to \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  either send a letter, they could do it through. We have the federal and \nSPEAKER_04:  It's called the Fed Ledge. \nSPEAKER_04:  Fed and state ledged, we renamed it recently, but it's basically \nSPEAKER_04:  We have \nSPEAKER_04:  staff who contact \nSPEAKER_04:  the state and the federal government about change in legislation and these types of issues, it can be added to that agenda. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I would recommend having your letter go to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then they can put it through their systems and manage it from there. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I hear you, Taylor. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know why this commission can't simply send a letter to Sacramento. I mean, I'm happy sending one to the City Council as well, but as an advisory board, even as an advisory board, I don't see why we would not be able to send a letter to Sacramento. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, what if the council then takes a position enough different than what we've taken? That's that there. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  for us. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  MBC \ub274\uc2a4 \uae40 \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, but so the problem that the chair is correct the problem is that your advisory to the city council \nSPEAKER_04:  And so you don't have independent authority to speak on behalf of the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  That's why it would need to go good to the VA. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think we'd be speaking on our own behalf as the ethics commission of the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  Anyway, but you're not independent from \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, that you're not independent from the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're not. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think if you maybe if you were the redistricting commission it would be a different conversation. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it'd be a lot of fun. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right? Because they're they're suffer from the city council, right? So \nSPEAKER_04:  Let's continue. \nSPEAKER_03:  continue that discussion another time I'm not conceding it but in the first let's To move on let's prepare a letter to the city council recommending they go to Sacramento with it and we can have that Conversation are you making that as a motion? \nSPEAKER_07:  and it's a motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  I move that we prepare a letter to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  who's the way that the ethics commission \nSPEAKER_03:  You have to do the writing it. \nSPEAKER_03:  that the chair and the vice chair prepare a letter to the city council for them to transmit to Sacramento expressing concern about the FPPC. \nSPEAKER_03:  termination of funding for AB1234 training and asking that Sacramento that the state legislature allocated appropriate funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  for the AB-124 training in 2024. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll second it. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll see you next time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, Commissioner Schott, what would like to second? \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there any discussion on the motion? \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there any public discussion on this? Is there any other discussion on anything related to this item? \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there any public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_07:  Seeing none, can you call the motion that... \nSPEAKER_07:  the vice chair and I write a letter to the city council. \nSPEAKER_07:  there. \nSPEAKER_05:  there. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, share in orbit. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner D.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  providing an update for the City of Long Beach Public Records Act program April. \nSPEAKER_00:  JT, do you want to just advance slides for me? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. Eric, can you pull up the PowerPoint? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so I think they're getting the clicker, so we can just put a couple of second pause on this and I'll get right into it. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, perfect. So we'll just go. So in April, I brought together, I brought forward an overview of the Public Records Act program for the City of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  There have been challenges then in the past and now due to a number of reasons. But this presentation today does review much of what we already discussed as grounding in what the program is, but also providing updates on progress and new initiatives since April. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I appreciate the chair and the vice chair allowing us to spend some time cleaning up the program and really dedicating resources to getting items closed out and then coming back to you now. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the overview today is includes challenges, dedicated resources, new efforts, initiatives, and progress made. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this is just another review of what the Public Records Act is. We've already presented this. It's in the presentation that was provided to you yesterday. You can ask any questions on this at the end, but I'm just going to. \nSPEAKER_00:  advance. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as was previously noted, challenges included COVID-19, staff vacancies, it's not a surprise, especially if you've been paying attention to budget discussions that we have, we still have significant vacancies within the city. The workloads and capacity have not changed. And so therefore with the vacancies, the workload and capacity continues to remain very high. And just as we still emerge from COVID, vacancies, homeless emergency staff have been feeling burnout and the overwhelming nature requests. \nSPEAKER_00:  contribute to that. \nSPEAKER_00:  So dedicated resources, we with the fiscal year 24 budget, as we've communicated, proposed the office of ethics and transparency so that we can bring together our Public Records Act program and our ethics commission and program under one umbrella. As I've communicated prior, this doesn't mean that any of the duties change. Heather and the team still work on what they're working on. Our peer 18 still works on what they're working on. But now there's a dedicated focus and just general ability to communicate that this is, this together is what we're doing to promote ethics and transparency for the city through the city manager's office. So in addition to myself, we have an assistant administrative analyst and a clerk type of three prior that was a temporary position, but through the support of the city manager as well as the ethics commission, we were able to structure the state of the city. And I believe our staff member, Sam, came on board around April and she's just been knocking things out of the park. So it's made a noticeable difference into tackling a lot of the old items and also \nSPEAKER_00:  incoming as we know we have city attorney team and then we have the police department I always like to note has their own separate team they have a couple of other related bills that require them to adhere to record disclosures and then citywide we have almost 50 liaisons these are not just 50 staff who are working on these a staff go beyond that but we have 50 liaisons who are basically what we would consider our SMEs subject matter experts or super users \nSPEAKER_00:  So new efforts and initiatives since we last presented. So we have met with every department's management team for a peer-a refresher. So myself, along with either Atoi or Anita, in the City Attorney's Office, have provided presentations to every department's management team. Because when we were working with the liaison, we realized that as much as they were really working hard and dedicated to closing out and addressing the peer-aids, it was really, they really needed the support of their leadership. So we started from the top. Dawn met with the City Manager's executive team, including all department heads. And then we did what we call a roadshow. We provide one-on-one virtual trainings with staff new to the GUABQA system and lieu of just sending them training materials and resources. So before, we only had one admin staff supporting this, they would just send them the existing materials and resources that we have. But now that we had an additional admin member, she's able to actually dedicate one-on-one virtual trainings with them, which I really do think makes a difference, especially if you're new to the GUABQA system as a user and a prover. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have established standing monthly meetings with the mayor and council offices to discuss their pending PRAs, address any questions or obstacles and provide support. We found that sometimes people just interpret things the way they're not meant to be interpreted and when we help them it actually simplifies a process that they seem to be over complicating. And so we're meeting with them monthly to walk through all of the outstanding PRAs that they have so that we can help them get them closed and gather documents. We're using new digital tools to create training materials. There is a tool called scribe that actually is better than Canva for training materials. So we started using that so that we can kind of bring together a more cohesive training program. We are working with department liaisons on individual tailored approaches. Everyone has different challenges. They have different operations, nuances. So we're working with them one on one to make sure we can address their individual needs, which again helps break down the complicated nuances and get them to where they need to be. And that just goes into revamping the training approach. And now we're working on many training guides to address the common questions that pop up over time from both staff and that staff when they're working on their teams and also when they're working in the GovQA system. \nSPEAKER_00:  progress made. So as of May we had 190 open PR requests that were considered 60 plus days old and 98 of them have since been closed. That's a big deal because as I mentioned before, some of these, you know, I just reviewed a batch that was only one attachment of several that needed to be closed out for a particular request and that particular item was over 300 pages of emails. So getting 98, 60 plus day, PRAs closed since May is a big accomplishment for our team. So on average, between May and August of this year, we received about 375 requests a month and we worked to close out about 343 requests per month. This compared to the same time period in 2022, the average received per month of 346 and the average closeout per month was 296. So our closeout rate has increased by about 6%. It's not a ton, but it shows improvement and it shows that the things that we are implementing are starting to show success. We'll take the small ones because it just builds over time. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that's it for me. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Come here, shot well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Great report. Really appreciate it. And I'd like the development of creating the Office of Ethics and Transparency. And I think that's going to create a lot of even more opportunities just to kind of... \nSPEAKER_06:  kind of help support both sides helping to support each other. I may have missed it, but in total then, what will be the size of the office? It's the first question. \nSPEAKER_00:  five FTEs. \nSPEAKER_06:  five fts and then the deputy city manager is over that office that's your role is it okay and that's and your role is focused just on that office \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, I have other projects and programs, but this is the core of my oversight, just like we have the Office of Climate Assessingability, and we have the Office of Equity. We create offices so that we can put the emphasis in the focus, and they're not just programs that are nice to have, like they are core programs and offices to the entire structure of our organization. So that was really the driver to creating this team, a cohesive approach that \nSPEAKER_00:  really showed the value of the mayor and council by approving it via the budget and our city manager too. \nSPEAKER_06:  So like the diversity and inclusion, I'm not getting the name right, that is a separate office. Okay, and but you oversee that office too. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that's another deputy. Thank you. That's all I want to go. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. That's what I want to come from. And I also very much appreciate your focus on targeted training for particular areas because everyone has a unique issues and that really helps to make sure that we are \nSPEAKER_06:  able to provide the records in a timely manner. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yep, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Before you go any further, I forgot to ask for a motion to receive a file that report. Somebody want to make the motion. And- \nSPEAKER_06:  Seconded. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does anyone else have any questions for April? \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  \ub0a0\uc528\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  following up on Commissioner Shotwell's questions. Are the people \nSPEAKER_03:  like the two that are listed under your position, the Assistant Administrative Analyst and the Clerk Type of Three. \nSPEAKER_03:  those people are only working on ethics. \nSPEAKER_03:  thing. \nSPEAKER_00:  pure thing to me. \nSPEAKER_00:  PRA. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think this is related to PRA. So no, to answer your question, they are PRA focus. They always have been. The clerk type is three is an addition. The intention is that hopefully over time as we close out the backlog, their capacity is freed up to support Heather in an administrative function, to track training progress, and that sort of thing. Right now, we talked about this. We're gonna give them time to focus on getting through the backlog of the PRAs, and then hopefully they can be as close to a 50-50 split between the PRA program and the ethics team. \nSPEAKER_00:  and is Vanguard CEO Th same As \nSPEAKER_03:  Heather's time going towards PRA. \nSPEAKER_00:  No, we might tap into Heather's expertise in the learn platform so that as we want to get trainings up into where code of conduct trainings live, but that shouldn't take much time. It's more guidance and pointing us in the right direction. But Heather is \nSPEAKER_00:  doing what she's been doing since she came up work. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I'm glad to see the extra resources being assigned to this. I think it's really important. So thank you to everybody that made that happen because I know it didn't just happen. \nSPEAKER_00:  made that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you have an idea? \nSPEAKER_03:  when you get caught up. \nSPEAKER_03:  and there \nSPEAKER_03:  that there won't be, there will only be a handful of requests that haven't been \nSPEAKER_03:  other than the ones that have just come in that have been written. \nSPEAKER_00:  with your future. \nSPEAKER_00:  responded to. So what I'm hearing is more or less more mostly caught up with the 60 plus state PRAs because the ones that come in are going to need time to to \nSPEAKER_00:  be addressed. \nSPEAKER_00:  We don't have a sense of time quite yet. We need, we're still working on addressing the old ones with the department heads and I do want to acknowledge the fact that Dawn and her team are becoming more involved in that with them. And I think that's important because we can advise them and train them on how it works, what it is, how you redact, is that a responsible document. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can we find something that achieves the goal of responding to this request in a more efficient way? But when we do have the lingering challenges, sometimes we need to get the city attorney's office to walk through it with those departments as well to highlight what they need to just put a little fire around. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  But we're trying to get them to do. So I'm hoping to come back in the new year with an update that we can address. You know, here's what we consider as outstanding. And here's where anticipating those items are closed out. But it's a revolving door, you know, next next month, a period that was only 45 days old is now 60 plus. So it's just ever changing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you keep track of whether or not the initial response that I think is supposed to be made within 10 days is made within 10 days? Yes. Okay. I think the next time that we have one of these reports that would be a useful. \nSPEAKER_03:  number two. \nSPEAKER_03:  to know. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if you could add that, I think it would be helpful. And also if you, like you, right at the end there, you gave us some comparative numbers to last year. I didn't quite get them, but I wish they were here. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  I could see them and I don't think they are. You just say. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I don't think. \nSPEAKER_03:  made it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, that's right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, that's presentation that was sent out. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, I added that. I added that. So we made the slime back up. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  including cuz people can \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  My team member was out, so I thought let me just send the PowerPoint and then I'll add it. So this PowerPoint, the most up-to-date one is on LedgerStar. I'm if you want to go back after the fact, but we'll get the PowerPoint back up so we can show you. Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  But it basically shows a 5% increase in monthly close outs, 5% or 6% and monthly close up since last year. So, here we go. So, we would... \nSPEAKER_00:  The 2022 closeout rate monthly. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  with \nSPEAKER_00:  Those. \nSPEAKER_00:  P.R.E.'s receipt versus closed out was approximately 85.5%. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then compared to this year that the same time frame is a 91.2% close at rate of the ones received so \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, that's what I didn't have and what I downloaded was what we were sent separately. I think so. Anyway, thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Last question I have is do these numbers include the requests that are being handled by the police department in there? \nSPEAKER_03:  That's it, unit. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  No, that's the whole, that's a separate team. So this is just citywide. This is not include the police department. But in the near, I'm happy to work with them to do a joint presentation on their \nSPEAKER_00:  their metrics as well as hours. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so when do you suggest we have \nSPEAKER_03:  Have you back on this issue? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  January? Okay, yeah. It might be hard, you know, we're hitting the holidays. So things might slow in terms of responsiveness. I mean, we're still going to respond within the legal requirements, but in terms of uploading documents and closing them out, we might see a little bit of a delay as staff quand vacation should be too much, but I think February is a good time to bring staff together to do another review. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so you think maybe overall this should be a twice a year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, for it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll be happy to do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll be happy to do that. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, that's great. All right, thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks, Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  On the chart, you say 190 of the original 190 that were open, 98 are now closed. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh-huh. \nSPEAKER_02:  of the requests that have been filed since May, the May through August numbers. Are any of those now over 60 days old? \nSPEAKER_00:  It could be and that's why I think when we were talking about this originally and we're getting into the data it's very hard. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's very hard to say because it's a fluid. So something that was not 60 days old yesterday is 60 days old tomorrow. And so it's hard to really dig in, which is why when we are going into data, the best way to communicate the information was by average of per month. So, yes, so there probably are some that were opened in May that are now 60 days old, same thing with June. \nSPEAKER_00:  So if you want us to get into it by month. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can do that. Like there was 30 received in May. \nSPEAKER_00:  of that time 60 were 60 plus days old. \nSPEAKER_00:  But it's hard because if I go into June and start saying that, well, I can tell you that. \nSPEAKER_00:  20 of the 60 plus day items were. \nSPEAKER_00:  closed out, but those could have been from prior to May, so the way it works is not always very clear. So we can talk about it in a chair and vice-chair meeting, and I can kind of show you the challenges with the data being so fluid. But as I was trying to dig into how we can best present the data, I was kind of hitting roadblocks. I mean, what we could do is we can get to one month, and we'd probably have like, \nSPEAKER_00:  three sides of data, but it's just... \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I would like more data. So on any day. \nSPEAKER_02:  Whatever day it is September 1, you go into the system. \nSPEAKER_02:  you can say to the system. \nSPEAKER_02:  show me all of the PRAs that are over 60 days old as of right today. Yes, okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  and if they're over. \nSPEAKER_02:  However, many days between May 1 and September 1, you know they pre-existed the May. \nSPEAKER_02:  day, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. Because you'll get a report that says we have 20 that are. \nSPEAKER_02:  120 days old. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have ten that are \nSPEAKER_02:  75, right? And you, is that a report that you're already getting? \nSPEAKER_02:  We can, yeah, we can slice the data that way. Okay. And can you also slice the data? Do you slice the data by department? Yes. Okay. So the way that you manage the overage PRA requests is you contact a particular department and say you have 10 that are over 120 days old. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so what do you have? \nSPEAKER_02:  What do you have? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  20 that are \nSPEAKER_00:  what we do is we send \nSPEAKER_02:  What we \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  who we were sending them monthly so we would send each department their monthly reports over 60 plus days old. It actually has all the data there. It shows it when it was open, who the requester was, what the requester is, how many days passed due. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, it is or how many days since we received it. So we don't say you have 10 that are 60 and 15 that are 75. We say here's your list, you see all the information and you can see how far back it goes. We are also doing the same thing which I didn't know in my presentation. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the department had briefing. So our city manager and assistant city manager brief with department heads at least monthly. Some of them, the larger departments are by monthly. So twice a month. And so every Friday, our team members send me the report. Here's all the department briefings we have coming up next week. And I go and put it in the CM and the ACM notes so that they know. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Public Works has to, parks has zero, you know. And so we have a couple of mechanisms to remind departments that they have end-to-perman heads that they have 60 plus day old periods. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I'm recognizing that the date is only good on the day that it's grabbed off the system. I would like to see as of a date. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you give it to us by department? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, over, you know, whether it's the number that they have over 60 days, if it's, if the report, if the data can spew out without a whole lot of manual labor, I'd like to know, you know, this department has 10 that are over 60 and five that are over 90, four that are over 120. I assume, you know, you've got 92 from the original 190 and right now those are probably, oh, well, they are well over six months old. \nSPEAKER_00:  bersViewedivo slip um. \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, some of them can be 61 days old. This is a 60 plus day report. \nSPEAKER_02:  No, no, I'm looking at the PowerPoint that was presented, the original 190 that were open, 98 of those are now closed, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Was that the original 990 or? If totally. \nSPEAKER_00:  it's totally. I guess it should read where as there were 190 open-perre requests that were 60 plus days old in May, there are only 98. \nSPEAKER_00:  that are, well actually no, I think it, so there's two ways we can read it. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  comprehensive and doing things to make the \nSPEAKER_00:  We can I would say yes of the 190 there are still 98 that's correct \nSPEAKER_02:  And there may be more because of the may time, because of the additional may time. \nSPEAKER_02:  In other words, if you take 190 subtract 98 that leads to 92. Do you have only 92? \nSPEAKER_02:  total PRA requests that are more than 60 days old right now or is that just from the original? \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe that it's just from the original, from the them and me. Yep. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, so it would be good to have some... \nSPEAKER_02:  more information on aging by department, how many are open and over 60 days old on the date you prepare the slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  God \u0421\u0435\u0440ds that. \nSPEAKER_00:  PM\u043e\u0442\u0430 CLO \u0430\u0432O \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, we'll talk more about it because I feel like \nSPEAKER_00:  I want to know what the goal of communicating this information is. Is it just so you have information? Is, you know, what is the goal of the data so that we know exactly how to pull it and how to tell the story? \nSPEAKER_04:  The goal is to give us reassurance that the number of outstanding PRAs are going, that are aging are going down. So to go to the vice chair's point, okay, there's roughly 92 that were open in May that are now still more than 60. But you've given us no information between May and September. How many that were not on that are now more than 60 days old. So really what we want to see is that that 60 day number is going away because the departments are closing them out more rapidly. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so I will just say in confidence that that 60 plus number will never go away. It won't ever go away because of the nature of some of the pierees that we receive. I mean, there's some pierees that they want the plans and the details for every major arterial street down to the AutoCAD files. That is going to be a multi-year piere to close it out. We are focused on making sure that we're legally compliant, which is that we are making significant or meaningful progress to providing those documents. So, whereas yes, we want them to be lower in nature. I just want to caveat that we're not going to see a day where we only have five, 60 plus day pierees. And that's why when we initially presented, there was, it's just very nuanced. So, you know, we have an item that's open six months, but we have ten, you know, assignments, which means all council mayor and maybe two departments that are uploading hundreds and hundreds of pages of \nSPEAKER_00:  It depends on the nature of the request. A community hospital or a Queen Mary is going to be more robust. I want to have a conversation related to what's the nature of the PRAs that are still open. There are multiple activities. We have ten activities associated with one PRA. All of them, but two have been closed. The request, even though it's 60, 90, 120, 90% of the documents related to their request. The other two activities probably are going to provide the same documents because they're all the same emails and the same people on it. But in order to comply with the law, those two offices still have to close theirs out. I do want to talk about the nature of these more robust periods are still open because I think it's valid to show that it's not that we're just sitting on it. There is a lot of staff time going into gathering historical documents or more robust data. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think dividing it by department will help us get to that. So we'll understand is it. \nSPEAKER_02:  aging because we still have a cultural problem or is it aging because of the nature of the request. So at some point you'll be able to get down to a point where a particular department can say, you know, my remaining aged requests are \nSPEAKER_02:  of a nature that they're going to require substantially more time. \nSPEAKER_02:  to complete. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think it's not as cut and dry as that. I think I could say it's both. I can say this department has both the nature and the culture at play here. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, and then we can have a critical staff member leave that was our number one on the Queen Mary for two years, and now we are scrambling to try to figure it out. So there's a story to tell around a lot of these, but I will acknowledge that there is just us still working through the cultural issues and the staffing challenges that surround what should be closed out easily. I mean, I can go into request and I can say 99% of the time, that should probably not take more than 20 days, and then there are sometimes a look at that, I'm like, this is going to be a really, really long one. So I appreciate that the Chair mentions that what is the compliance and assurance that we're making progress, but I also want to note that it's not all the stories on entirely told in the data that's provided, and then you have to really dig into the types of requests that we receive, and send departments might receive one huge request, and it takes them forever, and then all the other ones that get are small. So it just varies, it's not going to be, it could be a cultural and a nature, but it's just a lot of different factors, and just for my experience in seeing all these. \nSPEAKER_04:  And where a requester is asking for a plethora of information, we've gotten the culture acclimated to actually contacting the person, making the request so that we can understand what it is that they're asking for, what the end goal is so that we can kind of guide them to this information is what you need, not all of the street maps. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so I appreciate you asking that question because when we're doing our one-on-one trainings with the staff, the departments to work through their backlog as well as with mayor and council offices, that's the goal. It's like that's not what they're asking for. If you give them this, that will satisfy their requirement. And the other thing is like you don't get to have your department head sign off on purays that are deemed disposable by a city attorney or myself in some cases. You have to release it. So getting them to understand like \nSPEAKER_00:  the nuances and cut through and make things more efficient is also something we're working toward. And I think we're making progress, but I do believe the one on one and the more tailored approach is helping with that. \nSPEAKER_04:  So will agenda is for our next agenda setting meeting so that \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to share a North Median question. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I just have a quick question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry, Jared. \nSPEAKER_05:  April, thank you. Out of curiosity, when a PRA is received, \nSPEAKER_05:  Does it? \nSPEAKER_05:  Do you prioritize it based on the nature of the request? \nSPEAKER_05:  For example, there was a traffic accident at Pine and Ocean. I need records on the signals and the engineer. \nSPEAKER_05:  versus, oh my cat got stuck on a tree and I don't know if it's the city or the county line. Do you prioritize it when they come in or you handle it the day comes in or within those 10 days? \nSPEAKER_00:  We handle it within those 10 days generally speaking, although I will say that I get flagged on, that I'll send to the department and say, make sure you address this within the next week because I know what they're asking for can be handled in a day or two. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and do you prioritize? \nSPEAKER_05:  based on who sent in the request for resident versus an attorney representing. \nSPEAKER_05:  a plaintiff or defendant. \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  If it gets elevated to like for example the city attorney's office is working on something because they're representing the city. Okay. Then yes, absolutely we will look into that but just generally speaking if someone says you know I want. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Code enforcement went to a building flood. I want their reports. We treat them in its an attorney's office. We'll treat that like we do anyone asking for a permit for a past permit because they moved into a new house and they want to know if a permit got pulled for electrical. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  One follow-up question. If it's going to exceed the 10 days or it's a by-product period of time, do you provide an update or letter to the per-questor? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so that's one of the main, that was one of the main focus items that we were paying attention to around the April, May timeframe was let's just get into the habit at the very least you're responding within 10 calendar days and if you're not. \nSPEAKER_00:  You're asking for an extension before those 10 calendar days are up. And so I hope that we've kind of built that into it. And now it's addressing the speed of being the documents. But yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Any other questions for April? \nSPEAKER_04:  any comments from the public on this item? \nSPEAKER_04:  If you just come to the podium. \nSPEAKER_04:  and state, at least your first name for the record please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. How much time do I have? \nSPEAKER_04:  about three minutes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. I'm Laura Selmer. I'm a resident of District 4. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you commissioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  And thank you city staff. I appreciate the presentation a lot. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm here today because of a public request that's being denied. \nSPEAKER_01:  I didn't make the request. I'm just a party informed on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I'm wondering if there could be any, if there's any discussion about having any kind of arbitration. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't mean \nSPEAKER_01:  I just mean when there's a disagreement on why. \nSPEAKER_01:  why the records are being... \nSPEAKER_01:  withheld. \nSPEAKER_01:  and where they seem flawed. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the person might want to go. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know \nSPEAKER_01:  and have a bigger discussion, have some kind of a hearing or arbitration over that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Because right now it seems the only recourse. \nSPEAKER_01:  I remember the public has is to \nSPEAKER_01:  Get an attorney. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vila Lossu, very expensive for an individual. \nSPEAKER_01:  and also for the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it could easily be, I think, \nSPEAKER_01:  In the case that I'm bringing before you, it's \nSPEAKER_01:  an individual who's requesting records about euthanized animals at the shelter. \nSPEAKER_01:  And Joe. \nSPEAKER_01:  though all those records are being denied to the person. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I think it makes a lot of sense, this individual wants records because the shelter is claiming that it doesn't euthanize. \nSPEAKER_01:  healthy animals. \nSPEAKER_01:  but the public doesn't have any way to verify that. \nSPEAKER_01:  until they can look at some of the records and see. \nSPEAKER_01:  why animals have been euthanized. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that historically been something in place, that in animal welfare. \nSPEAKER_01:  people have been doing across the country. It's really just looking and seeing why the animals are euthanized. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, was it a minor? Did they have a cold? \nSPEAKER_01:  or what. And so that kind of transparency and disclosure is essential to some people who are looking at a very progressive shelter, but they just want to do their homework and check the records. \nSPEAKER_01:  others. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  records are now being denied to any member of the public who seeks them. \nSPEAKER_01:  but \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, another reason here is... \nSPEAKER_01:  that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Our veterinarians are buried at Long Beach Animal Care Services. \nSPEAKER_01:  five years ago they asked to add more staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  So they're very overworked. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, and if \nSPEAKER_01:  If they're not comfortable, believe it, we say. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  revealing the record. \nSPEAKER_01:  Then I think we have a bigger problem that we really need to staff up and support our veterinarians. \nSPEAKER_01:  but give them also a notice that \nSPEAKER_01:  Some of the work they do is public work. \nSPEAKER_01:  and there needs some members of the community want to see what's going on. Thank you very much. I'm Laura Selmer. \nSPEAKER_04:  for your comments. We'll take those under consideration at a future meeting. Any, can we call the vote on this item please? \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you make sure to know that? \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Divina Dictus. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can you make sure you're shot well? \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_00:  I.

Can I have a motion to receive and file the report? \nSPEAKER_02:  \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0631 the moose \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Norvey moved, Commissioner Feeler seconded. So in your agenda you have a copy of the draft, well actually it's not really drafting the survey tool that we plan on sending out to the community. Heather advises us that it's already been translated into the city's three threshold languages. So that's ready. The vice chair and I met with representatives of Long Beach forward and the nonprofit partnership on the 31st. They're going to help us also to see how we might get this out to the wider audience. We're going to see if we can make computers at the library's available, that we just get it out there because what we're really hoping is to get is robust. \nSPEAKER_00:  representation back and that will give us kind of a what we were trying to put together in a survey is a tool that will help us identify What are concerns in the community? What are areas that they're concerned about and we tried to make it as Wide and loosely based as possible the actual Draft lobbyist ordinance itself has not been changed since you last saw it the ad hoc committee decided that we didn't want to make any Changes in it until we had feedback from the community so that we didn't confuse anyone We'll be put working with staff to put together a one-pager that can go out in advance and kind of Help people understand what those proposed changes are So that in a nutshell is the report of the ad hoc are there any questions? \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair, thank you. These 11 questions, proposed questions, are they taken from our suggested questions a few months back? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's not the exact language that you gave us, but what we tried to do was take the spirit of what you were asking and include that in the questions that we refined. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. My second question is \nSPEAKER_02:  for question number three. \nSPEAKER_02:  There is no option for other. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just curious to know, should we add the option for other? \nSPEAKER_02:  on number three. \nSPEAKER_00:  We could do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Heather, can we make that change please? \nSPEAKER_02:  And then my last question is regarding number seven and eight. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seven are you a resident long beach? \nSPEAKER_02:  Should we ask? \nSPEAKER_02:  if they also work. \nSPEAKER_02:  and long beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does that matter? \nSPEAKER_02:  And number eight is what Council District you live in. \nSPEAKER_02:  Should we ask? \nSPEAKER_02:  what Councillor Dysarty will work in. \nSPEAKER_02:  as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  When we wrote those questions because the results of this will go to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  We wanted to show them what the voters in the people that are their direct constituent have said. Okay. So we could, but if they don't live in Long Beach we're going to present they probably work here. Okay. And we wanted to be able to have data that showed the council members. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  So they understand it. If they've got, you know, a thousand people in their district. \nSPEAKER_00:  that reside here, that are concerned about these issues, they'll understand that it really is an important issue for people in their community. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, I'm just hoping that... \nSPEAKER_02:  You said that. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a presumption that if the answer no, there's a presumption that they. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  They work. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can do the seven are you a resident or or do you work in and then maybe for the council district We just do which council just do we live in okay, and that would give us a delineation. Okay. Is that okay with everyone? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. I'm just thinking of other surveys and questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just thinking of other surveys and questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  They'll ask, do you live in Long Beach? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  or do you work in Long Beach? \nSPEAKER_00:  it's was edited out there, actually nayton Department of ethnicity of the Nation. Where? Where? Proceed, Ver\u8036 \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  So can we change number seven to be liver work and eight will leave as is. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Shatwa. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. A couple of questions. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  with regard to a more of a foundational question and it can be coming, we can ask it in the workshops themselves or done. \nSPEAKER_01:  the sessions themselves or in the survey question here but are is that \nSPEAKER_01:  It goes through the topics. Is it all topics that are raised or \nSPEAKER_01:  There's some should we consider topics that are only agendized. \nSPEAKER_01:  or formally before the city at a particular time, or we anticipate being before the city. That can be before on a city council agenda, or it could be something that has been submitted to a particular department for approval. So my question is, just general topics about things of interest, or should we also have an option, well, have a question that is focusing on what should be disclosed, general topics about anything discussed. \nSPEAKER_01:  or things that are more limited to particular \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  in a particular matter. I'm throwing out like a agenda topic or something that is formally before the city. I don't know what the right answer is or exactly how to word it, but that concept try to get a sense of really where do we, what are we trying to get information on anything and everything or just things that are formally before the city. I ask the question based on some experience where I do know some entities, we're only focused on it if it's actually on the agenda or has been formally presented to that particular entity. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's one question. \nSPEAKER_03:  We actually tried to avoid that distinction because it is also a distinction between lobbying and advocacy when something is on the agenda becomes lobbying. And we're trying to avoid in this survey getting at terms that are value-laden and trying instead to get down to what do you care about. \nSPEAKER_00:  And finally, \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're right, some organizations may not. \nSPEAKER_03:  engage until something's on the agenda. Those are organizations that engage in lobbying. \nSPEAKER_03:  because then it would be lobbying. This is to try to get at the broader issues of, well, if you care about something, do you want to know it, for example? \nSPEAKER_03:  certain folks are meeting with city officials about libraries. \nSPEAKER_03:  regardless of whether libraries are on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm very much. Thank you. I appreciate the explanation. \nSPEAKER_01:  Do we think it would be appropriate that we would say you can talk about libraries without any reporting but you cannot talk about cannabis? I'm kind of questioning how we would make that distinction. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're not. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  We're just gathering information. Gathering information. And then, okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  making that decision. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other question I have is with regard to question number four. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here we list who should be required to report and then we list a number of a through G. My only question is I mean and this goes to something that Commissioner Feedler and I talked about with regard to the disclosure policy. We've mentioned prior meetings is should it be on the city official or the person requests in the meeting. And why we make the distinction between the type of person requests in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  because we want to hear from the constituents as to what their thought process is. \nSPEAKER_01:  So they may say that if it's a non-profit organization, no, they shouldn't be required, but if it's a trade association, they should. \nSPEAKER_00:  or if it's an elected city official, you'll notice letter A is the city official. \nSPEAKER_01:  It will still then be on us to determine if that's fair in terms of the rules that we're proposing. Okay, so we're just gathering in for a moment. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  And if our recommendation goes to the City Council saying reporting should be required by the elected officials and blah blah blah we then have the data saying the constituents believe that this is the appropriate way to handle it. It's not just us looking like we're picking something out of the air. We have some backing for our recommendation. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I appreciate that. My only question was, to me, it was the person who's making the decision and the person trying to advocate or influence a decision. And I see everybody's listed in B through G as the people advocating. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  And so it was questioning why we make the distinction between who's advocating. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I do appreciate the fact that the opportunity to review and then the fact that we are getting the question around. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Feelor, do you have any comments? \nSPEAKER_00:  Susan, was there anything you wanted to add? \nSPEAKER_00:  No thanks. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, one final question. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm wondering since there's language and the proposed changes \nSPEAKER_02:  and forgive me, don't remember the number. \nSPEAKER_02:  We've gone back on for several times about \nSPEAKER_02:  the size of the organization. \nSPEAKER_02:  or agency or firm. \nSPEAKER_02:  Should we ask? \nSPEAKER_02:  how many members slash. \nSPEAKER_02:  employees. \nSPEAKER_02:  Slash. \nSPEAKER_02:  volunteers. \nSPEAKER_02:  are part of your organization. \nSPEAKER_02:  firm. \nSPEAKER_02:  or association. \nSPEAKER_02:  or we're thinking about \nSPEAKER_00:  We can't. We can't. \nSPEAKER_02:  placing a number of \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, if you're \nSPEAKER_02:  If your membership is less than 50 or if your membership is higher than 50 \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  the picture. Should we consider that? \nSPEAKER_00:  The proposal is written right now is based on a budgetary size. And so if you look at question three, \nSPEAKER_00:  It says if you answered yes to question one which communications to city officials should be. And letter B is communications with representatives of a nonprofit organization and then you have a selection of all nonprofits, representative nonprofit service organizations. And this language is as was recommended to us specifically by the nonprofit partnership and the Long Beach forward. They thought that where we had the dollar amount previously was too low. There's still a little concern about a $2 million threshold but they said they would be okay. Oh no, we've \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, we went, you know what, we didn't catch the five in I-I. Three is... \nSPEAKER_03:  It's in I.I.B. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  B3. \nSPEAKER_02:  be great. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's right. Okay, we gave them two different levels. Okay. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  levels. Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Any other comments, questions? Any public comments? \nSPEAKER_00:  seeing them. Can we call the vote please? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Michelle and Irving. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner DiBena Dictus. Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Chappell.

Can I have a motion on the recommendation to discuss the ethics commission role if any and reviewing the campaign disclosure statements to report alleged violations for enforcement during the 2024 election cycle? \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a motion by Commissioner Chattwell and a second by Commissioner D. Benedictis. So before we go into this item, I just would like to announce that the vice chair and I push Taylor again about the possibility of serving on more than one committee. And I'm happy to report that she has reviewed everything and rendered a decision that we can serve on more than one committee as long as we all remember that we cannot discuss what we're working on in any other committee. So when we meet with the committee, it's only to discuss those items that that committee is discussing. And I think that may have been a concern last month when we were discussing this if we would have enough people to do this and the other work that we've been doing. So with that, are there any discussion comments? \nSPEAKER_01:  Do we want to move forward with a vote to approve our and we don't have to set up the committee right now because JT When are the first financials do? \nSPEAKER_02:  Let me check on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not before November meeting. We could set up a committee in November, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I think November should be fine. Like there are like \nSPEAKER_02:  some filing that have taken place ready for this election cycle. Okay. But those are like... \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  not official candidates at this point because nomination period doesn't start until November. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you are interested in serving on that committee, please let Heather know before our November meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  I just chair I think because of the way the recommendation is written that we would need to clarify that it sounds like the motion is that the ethics commission intends to create an ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we would \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  And the motion doesn't let us do that today, does it? Oh, we have to do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  No, it does. You can't just accept the recommendation as written. So you just would need Commissioner Shotwell would need to amend the original motion so that \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Ryu. \nSPEAKER_01:  an ad hoc to look at financial statements. Do you do that Commissioner Shotwell? \nSPEAKER_01:  You just stay in the mic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  and commissioners that changes okay with you also. Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  and seeing no members of the public. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, you want to speak commission to it? Oh, you do. OK. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, it says you want to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think you signed up for the last item, but you were on the wrong one. I could clear that out if you'd like. \nSPEAKER_01:  When we lost our second of the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are we good to call the vote?

So before Heather actually starts her report, I think you all are aware that Julian Santa Nuda is going to be leaving us. I know we're all very sad. He's become an integral part of our team, but we want to wish him well and his new endeavors. That's the hard part about having staff that are really, really good is that they look for opportunities to grow and expand. And I personally would hope that they would each look for opportunities to grow and expand and we wish you the best. And now you can duck down so we can say hello to Jorge. \nSPEAKER_01:  Or, hey, you want to introduce or April, did you want to introduce? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, Julian has been an integral part. He is the OG staff member, along with JT, that really built this commission alongside all of you. It was, you know, bringing a new commission, especially charter is not for the faint of heart. And I think we've really gone to a good place and that. \nSPEAKER_05:  is due to the hard work of G.T. Hullian, Becky, and Amy. And so we've been privileged as a team to join them, to support the work that this commission is set out to do. And so just thank you, Julian, for all of the work that you've done. We work beyond just ethics together on a lot of other things. So, I have to see him go. But I'm really excited to see what he's going to do for the larger Long Beach business community and his new role. And a great promotion, well deserved in economic development. \nSPEAKER_05:  We do have a city member joining us who has worked for the organization for some time on the Civic Center project. It's familiar with change management, how to get staff on board to, you know, what we need to do to get them on board to adopt new projects programs, cultural shifts. Before George talks a little bit more Jorge, I would like to thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I would say it's all so when Jorge joined us back in 2018 I hired him into public work as an analyst and he went by George and \nSPEAKER_05:  I've been known to me in the last year he's now Jorge. So I feel really bad whenever I say George, because it's not culturally appropriate. I am part Latina and so it feels like a misstep. So I'm gonna continue to say that I'm learning. But before Jorge talks a little about his experience, I just wanna give Julian some time if you have any comments or thoughts to, before you part this particular role but staying within the organization. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I've reached out to you guys all, but why not address your body, right? So yeah, I guess JTN have been here for a good bit, but just reiterate what I've told you to guys separately, and that is that it really has been a pleasure working with you all. I think we went through the frustrating times, the good times as well. And it's been really good seeing, and then being with you evolve over time over the two plus years that I've been with you, seeing the frustration in your faces, and then also the wins in your faces as well. So it's been a great rollercoaster ride, and I've enjoyed being on it with you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I feel very good have no concerns about where, you know, this commission is that. Otherwise, I would have hesitation in leaving. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I've enjoyed initiating this with you all and \nSPEAKER_03:  know that good things are coming the way, partly because of all the ad hoc that I work with you on and the policies that we've drafted and researched so it really has been uh, they're all safe fun uh and \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, what April says is true. I will actually miss you guys, believe it or not. And everything that comes along with the commission, but I know that Jorge and Heather and April and Taylor will continue to support you in very good ways. And JT, where there is the real OG though. Yeah, and I'm just, you know, I'm still into the same. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, yes, Natalie, who's new to the team. Sorry, Natalie. We won't get to work long, but I'll still be here. So I will still be here. And as I mentioned to you guys, I am taking my ethical lens with me. So if you're not, you'll have an ambassador and an advocate of the ethics program at the Commodore Development Department. So thanks for letting me work with you. I appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Julian. Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi everyone, so yeah, my name is Jorge Godinez. I'm fresh off the ethics training that had their narrated, so I am caught up on that and got that in on time. But yeah, I come from Department of Public Works where I've been since 2018, joined as an analyst there. First project I worked on was the whole civic center move. So that was actually my first experience with city government right out of grad school. And I think it was the best experience I could have gone because I had a chance to really meet people from all the various departments. So I actually had an opportunity to work with Heather, and PASS, JT and the PASS just engaging with all the different departments. And then with public works, you know, we just naturally are involved in a lot of things. So there I was doing, I was managing the city's off street parking operation. So that's a big operation we had there. I was also doing contracts and grants as well. So bringing in some federal dollars through the infrastructure bill, the federal infrastructure bill, a really good experience. And then I was also the staff liaison for the Belmont Shore Parking Commission. So I do have commission experience there as well, which is interesting because I come here and I see all the support here and with the parking commission, it's just myself and someone else. And I'm literally and I just are doing the agendas, drafting everything, putting together reports. So like wow, there's a lot of support here, which is kind of nice. So I'm looking forward to that. And then I'm working, looking forward to learn more about the ethics commission and how I can support, supporting Heather and her role. I know that she had the new role in a dedicated role to ethics, which is great to see. And new office, so excited about that. Rejoining April, who I consider a mentor. So I'm excited about that. And then we are working with JT and the rest of the team. So looking forward to it. And yeah, we're happy to be here. Nice to meet you all. \nSPEAKER_01:  Alright Heather, now it's your turn. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  But you're not going anywhere. \nSPEAKER_01:  But you're not going anywhere. \nSPEAKER_01:  No. \nSPEAKER_06:  No, not today. \nSPEAKER_06:  So just a couple of things, I should have brought this up during the item, but for the community meeting in October, we just need to finalize a time. Right now I have a hold on five to nine, so just something to think about. We don't have to decide today, but just keep that in mind with. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it would be better if we decide today so that we can make it public. Sure. Is five a good time for the public that works to come or would 530 be better? \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would recommend no earlier than 530. \nSPEAKER_01:  Let's do 5-3, I'm going to do 5-30-9. \nSPEAKER_01:  And what if we get so much comment that it needs to run later? Is that okay? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  We're in it for the long haul. \nSPEAKER_01:  Is that... \nSPEAKER_06:  that work lawn, \nSPEAKER_01:  for everybody. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, for October. Correct. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, the end of October. Yeah. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  That's the 29th, isn't it? The 25th. October 25th. I knew it was somewhere in there. \nSPEAKER_02:  The 25th October 25th. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, the 25th. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I think you have to be dressed in a costume if it's like five days previous or after Halloween. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  for commissioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  We will be in costume. We'll be coming as commissioners. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  And then also you mentioned the one page you're hiding. \nSPEAKER_06:  If we're going to do a one-pager to send out, we should have that very soon, only because I want to translate that too. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  You were working on that right? \nSPEAKER_01:  That's a really important thing. \nSPEAKER_05:  What a story! \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. I was fully in working on that with you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can that be his last assignment? \nSPEAKER_06:  We've tried to \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, we'll let Julian transition and we'll bring Georgia horse hay into really hopefully that effort. He'll be great. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Z \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Let's get in touch this week. Sounds good. Training update. So we've got 75% of our workforce is now enrolled. So it's gone up about 6% since our last meeting. Of the 5700 or so that are currently unlearned a little over 3,000 of them have taken the training. So we're at a 53% completion rate, which is awesome, for a brand new training program. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  On the survey, we've got almost 600 people that have given feedback, which is really awesome, too. So excited to start extracting information and doing stuff with that feedback. \nSPEAKER_06:  The ethics guide update, so Taylor did complete the, we did a basic update to the existing guide, including the current city attorney. So Commissioner Norvey, we, that's checked off our list. I know we had talked about that before. So that's uploaded and then we continue to work on the bigger, good government guide as well as the code of conduct, the smaller guide to that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Just a reminder that we are moving from ledger star to one meeting. You'll get an email soon from the city clerk team about that transition and what that looks like. \nSPEAKER_06:  Just a reminder, if you haven't, to activate your learn accounts. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you haven't activated your account, your link has probably expired, so just reach out to me and we'll get that activated for you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are there some of our commission members that haven't finished the ethics training? \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't want to out anybody, but if it's a yes, maybe we could get that finished before our October meeting or actually, preferably by the end of the month. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, it's not that long a training, so it would be good if we set the example and everyone finishes it. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then I think that's really that we just continue to work on the FY24 curriculum. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that's all I have. Oh, and then I did. I mentioned to the Chair and Vice Chair before the meeting started that the ethics help line. We are. \nSPEAKER_06:  It looks like we're going to have to part ways with the auditor, not because we want to, but because the technology that we thought was going to be available to us to do it with one phone number is not available to \nSPEAKER_06:  to do \nSPEAKER_06:  to have the program run in the way we need it to run. So we will, we're working with NavX to \nSPEAKER_06:  create our own account that will give us our own telephone line and we'll have to update our web intake process but we'll still be using our ethics point form for now and just redirecting people. That's going to take some time given my experience so far. But so with that being said, we'll continue to use our current online form and work with the auditor on any ethics calls that they get on their help line so more to come on that. And that is my report. Thank you. Are there any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So first on the last point, I think you may have just mentioned it, but so. \nSPEAKER_02:  If that's going to create some confusion, so some people will call for the ethics office and really meaning to go to the auditor. So those cases then would be transferred. And does the auditor, does NavX handle both the auditor and the ethics helpline? So it should be easy for them to possibly move cases back and forth. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, ultimately the way it works is the communication specialists at NAVACS. If someone calls the auditor's hotline, that call, and however that specialist qualifies it from their list of qualifiers, however they qualify it, that automatically goes to the auditor's team. \nSPEAKER_06:  If doing as the auditors team starts to dig into it and they realize that this is more for the ethics team, it would have to come from them. The NAVIX folks would not decide if that's a better fit for the ethics helpline. And that was... \nSPEAKER_06:  That was part of my concern as it became. \nSPEAKER_06:  obvious that we weren't going to be able to do this the way we thought we were going to be able to do it where they help line \nSPEAKER_06:  automatically gets their calls based on \nSPEAKER_06:  the script that the communication specialist was following. It's very confusing. I don't want to load you with all of the details that I've had to process. But I know it is frustrating and a little discerning that we have to start here, but it's also a good time to do it because this program is still like we like to say in the incubation period. So this is the time for things to go wrong and for us to fix it. So it kind of studies itself as the program grows and \nSPEAKER_06:  Once this. \nSPEAKER_06:  you know, our new helpline and the Web and Take form is where we need it to be, you know, it, that's where it stays for now. So it's not ideal, but it's also not the end of the world. That's what I keep telling myself. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Also switching topics on the training. I'd be very interested with your sharing with the commission, the feedback that you get on the training. Maybe not line by line, but just the themes that you get in the feedback on the training for the feedback form. Sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  I found that I want to compliment you on the training. I really liked the training. I'll be honest with you when I first started. I was a little concerned that as like we're getting, a lot of entities are getting away from just oration training, but I actually found it as I was going through it to be very effective to continue to have that oration. A lot of companies are going to really requiring \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, the individual take in the training to actually read in this little volume or \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh \nSPEAKER_02:  sound in the training. My concern is oftentimes people then get to clip through. So I want to commend you. I thought it was done very well. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I just want to \nSPEAKER_05:  say because I won't say herself. She has gotten a lot of accolades and a lot of congratulations on a job well done not just with what Commissioner Shottwell saying about how it's laid out but also her her recording voice so and I think that's really important because when people have really great things to say about a training then they'll say it to other people and then those people will like oh this isn't gonna be so bad and we've gotten feedback from utilities department so non-city manager departments our city manager also thought she had a great voice so it just gone really well and in all it had her gift specific spread no she won't do her own horns I'll do it for her bye bye \nSPEAKER_01:  If I could turn, I met with the auditor this morning and she was highly complimentary of the training also. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that she was very happy to see it being implemented and thought it was a really good program. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, thank you as I am still doing my... \nSPEAKER_06:  different, I'm still on my road show talking to different departments and commissions and we've gotten to a point where the folks that I'm meeting with have most have taken the training by now. So I am, it's nice to just to get that feedback that people are taking it and interested and they're starting to recognize me and recognize the program which are all things that we are striving for. So it is very exciting to see \nSPEAKER_06:  Things starting to come to life, and like April said earlier, the little winds turn into big winds, so it's just, it's very exciting to be where we are. \nSPEAKER_06:  No. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Any other questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_01:  Any public comments on this item? \nSPEAKER_01:  Seeing none, can we have the vote to receive them via? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Michelle Norby. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Mr. DiPanadictus.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  The last item on the agenda is a recommendation to receive and file a report from the ad hoc committees. Discuss anticipated ad hoc committees for upcoming projects and if appropriate, take actions to dissolve or create ad hoc. Can I have a motion to receive and file the discussion? \nSPEAKER_04:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll second. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  We move by Commissioner Weiss, seconded by Commissioner Schottwell. So we've already had the report from the lobbying ad hoc. The only other ad hoc is the one that Commissioner Schottwell and Commissioner DeBenedick does sit on and I understand Commissioner Schottwell is ready with the report. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, in Commissioner D. Benedictus' absence. So Commissioner David Inectus, all right. And I have met with staff with regard to the policy ad hoc. The first focus will be on the conflicts of interest policy and developing a new comprehensive COI policy. That policy will deal with conflicts of interest generally, personal conflicts of interest. That will also include references to form 700, our procurement, conflicts of interest, and financial conflicts of interest. I'm sorry, the financial conflicts of interest is one of the references to form 700. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're developing a template using what we know that cities are using recommendations for a template for future policies, which will include definitions, reference materials, and disclosure processes. In parallel, we're developing a new CDY draft annual conflict of interest disclosure for consideration by the commission, with the policy. We'll need to revise the city personnel policy 1.7. This is dealing with collateral employment and business activities. And that policy was actually last updated, I believe, back in 1989. And we're revising the associated disclosure and request forms. That's on conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll have a we're planning on a separate policy, which will be referenced in the conflict of interest policy. That policy will focus on gifts, meals and entertainment or gifts, meals and gratuities. With the possibility of weeding it at least referencing and if. \nSPEAKER_04:  desired to be maybe eliminating the tickets policy. Both of these policies we intend to provide or we're aiming to provide in the October meeting depends on our ability as we draft them and then are working with staff on revisions but the plan is to give them before the commission in the October meeting. And then after we get the commission's feedback then share them with other city stakeholders for additional consideration. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so that's my report on behalf of Commission J. Benetictus and I and if anyone has any questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  Any questions for Commissioner Chattwell? \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there any public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_02:  just there was I think an interest in potentially changing the name of the ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_02:  The core layer gave him a very long name that we wanted to kind of revise potentially. \nSPEAKER_02:  the end of call. \nSPEAKER_04:  I forgot what the long name is. Can you help me out? I do remember our discussion on that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, the current name on that is the ad hoc committee on the development of coralie ethic policies to the vendor code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is that what we want to change the ad hoc name to? \nSPEAKER_02:  That's what a currently is. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, and what do we want to change it to? \nSPEAKER_04:  policies at Hawk. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  updated policies out of. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so you want to amend that right now we just have a receive and file your report. So you want to amend the motion to change the name of your... \nSPEAKER_03:  at Hawk to the updated policies at Hawk. \nSPEAKER_04:  We can, I did not make the motion, I seconded the motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's okay, you can make an amendment. Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, so I will make the amendment that we update the name of the committee just for ease of reference to the updated policies committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that's okay with the maker in the second of the original motion. \nSPEAKER_00:  It is. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  here you have water Add \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  All right. Is there any public input? \nSPEAKER_01:  Laura Selmer. Thank you again commissioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just have a question on this agenda item because I'm trying to follow along as you're going and \nSPEAKER_01:  So I click on the attachment. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the report is not available to the public in the agenda item. And I just thought, you know, I wanted to follow along with the report and that was made. And it's \nSPEAKER_01:  not actually here as an attachment. So I don't know if that's intended. \nSPEAKER_01:  or it might be an oversight. So thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're more reports are just verbal and this is a verbal report. That's why if you see the full agenda it says there's no written report. Thank you very much. You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's why if you see the \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we call the vote on this, please? \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm gonna share another. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  \u05db\u05de\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d3\u05e7\u05ea, \u05db\u05de\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Schatler. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Wise.
