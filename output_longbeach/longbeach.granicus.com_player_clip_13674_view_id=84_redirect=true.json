        "transcript": "SPEAKER_19:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  So the next item up is a recommendation to discuss the progress report from the ad hoc committee on the lobbyist ordinance recommendation. I'm going to have Commissioner Pollock give the report of the ad hoc first and then have the commission discuss it before we go into public comment. We're going to limit public comment to two minutes per person. And I'd like to say at the outset that we will not be voting on accepting or adopting any ordinance recommendations at this meeting. This is just an update. We are working with the staff on what a what a meeting would look like to have specific community input on the recommendations as we're going forward. So this is an ongoing process. So please tailor your comments accordingly. And the other thing I'd like to say is we know that there's a lot of interest in this. We appreciate everyone's interest. And it's really what we want to see is what the community thinks about what we're recommending. And as Commissioner Pollock will discuss, our goal is to make sure that there's transparency for the people that are the voting constituency. And even the non voting constituency, but the constituency in the city of Long Beach as to who is influencing the decision makers in the city. And as you're tailoring your comments, if there's something in the recommendation that you think is just not workable, what do you think would be a workable solution to enhance transparency? That's part of what we're asking everyone also and we will be asking going forward. So with that stage set, Commissioner Pollock, would you like to give the report please? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. At the March meeting we had significant public comment and we also received a significant number of submissions from written submissions from the public and we appreciate the input. The ad hoc committee met several times having reviewed all of the comments whether at the meeting or in writing. And we have made a number of changes from the draft recommendations that were submitted in the February and March meetings. I'd like to first review those changes and then discuss briefly the key provisions that we are continuing to work. First, the lobbying ad hoc modified certain of the recommendations. I'm sorry, can you go to the next page? \nSPEAKER_03:  Next page. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Loving ad hoc has modified specific recommendations. First eliminated the proposed requirement for registration and disclosure by business improvement districts, neighborhood associations and project area committees. Second continued the exemption for small 501c3 nonprofits and defined small as those that file IRS form 990 easy or 990 N and the requirements for those forms are 501c3 nonprofits with annual gross receipts less than $200,000 in assets less than $500,000. The reference to the IRS form is also under consideration by the LA City Council and would allow the amounts to change over time with inflation if the IRS changed the requirements for the forms without having to modify the ordinance. Also the ad hoc has replaced the requirement for entities to account for time spent in preparation for contacts with a requirement that entities disclose with their filings any materials provided to see the City leadership in connection with disclosed contacts and replaced the proposed requirement for City electives and staff to prepare reports of contact by lobbyists but replace that with appropriate funding to provide for robust audits of filings. The draft recommendations \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  continue to address advocacy as the current ordinance is written. Lava being only occurs when there is an effort to influence a specific legislative or administrative action. \nSPEAKER_14:  Mm. \nSPEAKER_03:  advocacy would encompass. \nSPEAKER_03:  the same kinds of efforts to influence city action but when there is not yet an item of specific legislative consideration or even as to new matters that are under consideration by the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  The threshold for disclosure, the ad hoc is continuing to recommend a reduced threshold for disclosure, moving from 50 hours to 10 hours in a three-month period or three contacts within a month. \nSPEAKER_03:  We, the ad hoc does want to recommend additional information be provided with the filing because if you look at the lobbying reports right now, sometimes it's very difficult to understand what position a particular lobbyist has taken. So there would be additional information required. So the current ordinance requires reporting on a six month cycle. By the time the six month cycle comes up, a matter may have come up before the city council and been decided before the public is aware of the influences that were brought to bear on the city decision makers. \nSPEAKER_03:  In addition to the current exemption for 501c3 organizations, there's an exemption for lobbying by other nonprofits, primarily 501c4, 5 and 6, which lobby the city using uncompensated \nSPEAKER_03:  members or directors. And so now significant lobbying can occur on behalf of 501C, 4, 5, and 6 organizations through uncompensated individuals. And the lobbying ad hoc is proposing to \nSPEAKER_03:  eliminate that exemption. \nSPEAKER_03:  In doing so, we recognize that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Non-profits often seek grants, support bond issuances and the like. There is currently in the ordinance an exemption for an entity that is having contacts with the city regarding bids and RFPs, and we would recommend expansion of that exemption to cover nonprofit organizations when they are seeking grants. Addressing bond issuances and the like. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know that the requirement that certain nonprofits register and disclose their activities, whether it's lobbying or advocacy is somewhat controversial. I would like to note the sorts of influences that may occur, for example. Assume there's an educational institution and they have decided they'd like to... \nSPEAKER_03:  open a satellite campus in Long Beach. They've identified several contiguous plots of land. One of those plots of land is owned by the city. Under the current rules, if that educational institution is a nonprofit, they would not be reporting on their conversations with city officials in an attempt to sell the idea of the educational institution opening a satellite campus in Long Beach. By the time the public would know of that effort, it might be very far down in the decision making process. Another example is that where you have a 501C6, which could be a trade association or a business league, let's assume you have a construction trade association. As long as they are using uncompensated members or officers. \nSPEAKER_03:  their lobbying would not be transparent to the public. And they might be meeting with city officials to talk about the impact of affordable housing requirements on the construction industry. And we believe that there should be greater transparency to those contacts. \nSPEAKER_03:  In addition, we'd be asking for the city to adequately fund robust audits and education for city officials and for the public who would be impacted by these changes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Lastly. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  enforcement at present of the lobbying ordinance can only be by \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Meanor or in fraction pursued by the City Attorney's Office, we're recommending administrative penalties be available. \nSPEAKER_03:  The Edhock Committee wants to increase the information available to the public on a timely basis regarding the efforts to influence decision-making without imposing undue burdens. \nSPEAKER_03:  We intend to seek concurrence of the full commission today to hold appropriate public or community meetings focused on potential changes to the current ordinance that would advance such goals. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's the committee report. \nSPEAKER_19:  Susan, was there anything you wanted to add? \nSPEAKER_21:  No, I'm interested in hearing the comments and questions from the commissioners and people that are here that want to speak. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay, so for Commissioner Dedenit, this and Commissioner Fiedler. \nSPEAKER_19:  When Commissioner or Vice Chair indicates that we're looking at having an appropriate meeting, basically there are two ways that we could handle a meeting for public comment and input to go forward. We could hold a public hearing where it would be noticed as a public meeting and all of the commissioners would participate. \nSPEAKER_19:  and hear the comments, but there would be no, just as an arm meeting where there is no dialogue back and forth. \nSPEAKER_19:  we would only be able to receive the comments in a public hearing. \nSPEAKER_19:  The other way to do it would be to have staff conduct community meeting or meetings. And if the staff conducts it, then they can have a more robust dialogue with the community members. So I know that that's the first that you've heard that there are two different ways that we could do that. And if you want to \nSPEAKER_19:  Think upon that for just a few minutes while we go forward. The other thing that we have talked about also is making sure that this is noticed on our website, that the documents are placed on our website, with an email that people can email in the comments. And I'd tell you, I believe you're working on that. \nSPEAKER_03:  If it's a community meeting, can we? \nSPEAKER_19:  members of the commissioners attend? We can attend as members of the public, but we would not be there in our capacity as a commissioner. \nSPEAKER_19:  because I think I believe Taylor is at right April. If all seven of us are there, does it then become a public meeting? \nSPEAKER_30:  I think so, yes. So Taylor had to sit by a way for a call with a council member, but we'll all talk to her about that. And if it's different, we'll let you know. \nSPEAKER_19:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_30:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_19:  Yeah, that would be the challenge is if we all seven show up, it might become a public meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  so we could nominate three. \nSPEAKER_03:  that's it and that way it will not work? \nSPEAKER_04:  So Commissioner Feedler? Just one follow-up question on that. So in that second hypothetical, if for example, like Vice Chair Pollock just proposed, say only three and no more than three commission members attend the meeting, are those three commission members able to engage in any sort of dialogue, or are we still, \nSPEAKER_19:  there would just be the staff that would be having the dialogue. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  because we would not be able to. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_19:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. \nSPEAKER_19:  because the brown act we're limited and what we can do. \nSPEAKER_04:  Got it. Just wanted to confirm. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_19:  I'm gonna be an addictist, did you have anything else? \nSPEAKER_21:  Bye, of course. \nSPEAKER_19:  Oh, I'm sorry. Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_21:  Yeah, I would like to ask Taylor some more questions about the Brown Act restriction, because I read some of the materials, and I understand that you can't go off topic, that you can only talk about what's on the noticed agenda or whatever, but I'm not seeing where you actually can't ask a question back. So I'd like more clarification about that restriction. There's a lot of warnings, and I understand it is difficult if someone starts talking whether it's one of us or one of the public about something that's not on the agenda, that's a problem, and someone has to say, \nSPEAKER_21:  We've gone too far. But anyway, I would like a little more. \nSPEAKER_21:  information on that when we can get it. And the reason is because in the ideal meeting, \nSPEAKER_21:  for me at least. What we would have is a discussion in which \nSPEAKER_21:  we could all work towards achieving the joint goals, or what I hope are the joint goals, because I think from the work that we've been doing in the subcommittee, the goal is to make sure that the public gets the information that they're entitled to have about who is influencing the government. This is just what the chair said at the very beginning when we started this topic. Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_21:  Nobody wants to burden anyone, but we want to figure out a way to collect that information. \nSPEAKER_21:  as it becomes significant. And sometimes there are huge things that happen, decisions that are made. \nSPEAKER_21:  without that sort of transparency. And sometimes I can think of, and some of the examples portray this, \nSPEAKER_21:  of situations where it is a nonprofit that's involved and it's not because the nonprofit's doing anything wrong, it's doing what they do and there is a tremendous contribution that they make. But we need to figure out a way, what we're looking for is a way to \nSPEAKER_21:  make that information available so the public \nSPEAKER_21:  can understand that influence. \nSPEAKER_21:  That's my ideal. \nSPEAKER_21:  That's my ideal meeting and that probably would involve some questions, but if we stand topic, then can that not happen? \nSPEAKER_21:  So. \nSPEAKER_21:  That's my concern. \nSPEAKER_19:  you \nSPEAKER_19:  but we'll have to wait for Taylor to come back and then you can re-express your question. Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  the mission of the Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_20:  Um \nSPEAKER_20:  with the exception to hearing some of Taylor's responses. I tend to be more supportive of the public hearing and where staff collects information. I don't know if, I think we can still achieve the same goals by collecting the information from the public, I like the email, and then there's still much to be considered. Based on what I'm hearing from the vice chair, it sounds like there's been a lot of movement and change, however, there's some areas that still need to be work through. And I think that's gonna take some time. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay, seeing no other comments from the commissioners, let's open it up to public comment. So again, public comment will be limited to two minutes each if you want to start lining up at the podium. \nSPEAKER_19:  anyone who's interested in making a public comment on this item. \nSPEAKER_19:  and JT, do they need to say their name for the record? \nSPEAKER_33:  They don't have to, but it is prefer. \nSPEAKER_19:  If you would like to state your name or organization for the rest of your life. \nSPEAKER_17:  you \nSPEAKER_33:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_17:  you \nSPEAKER_19:  Please feel free to \nSPEAKER_17:  to do so. \nSPEAKER_19:  you \nSPEAKER_17:  My name is Laine Anna Noble. I am here on behalf of the North Pine neighborhood Alliance. \nSPEAKER_17:  which is downtown. \nSPEAKER_17:  I first want to congratulate you for recognizing that \nSPEAKER_17:  the previous wording that included neighborhood groups. \nSPEAKER_17:  was created an incredible barrier. \nSPEAKER_17:  to you or anybody in the city hearing from us. \nSPEAKER_17:  So I'm glad that we are now not included in your efforts. \nSPEAKER_17:  But they also want to point out to you that as a neighborhood group, we have the opportunity to work with many nonprofits here in Long Beach. And this is our experience. The language you are currently proposing is the exact opposite of achieving equity. \nSPEAKER_17:  of achieving democracy. \nSPEAKER_17:  of listening to the majority of residents who are low income, immigrant, by-pawk folks. \nSPEAKER_17:  and with language access. And so I'm very concerned as a neighborhood activist about your current version. \nSPEAKER_17:  I also want to state that our experience in being advocates is that there's two sources of advocacy in Long Beach. One of them is money. \nSPEAKER_17:  and the other is numbers. \nSPEAKER_17:  And I hope you will address that as the basis for your decisions. \nSPEAKER_17:  because numbers is all me and my neighbors have. \nSPEAKER_17:  is our numbers. We do not have money. \nSPEAKER_17:  I also want to urge you to think about community good instead of profit. Those are the two big differentiations and our experience advocating for our neighbors and for our neighborhood. \nSPEAKER_17:  And I finally want to make sure you know. \nSPEAKER_04:  time isn't\u017cossible. \nSPEAKER_17:  that there have been three successful efforts, the housing element. \nSPEAKER_17:  working to protect all of us around COVID. \nSPEAKER_17:  and the Cambodia town development. If we did not have the nonprofits, regardless of their budgets, \nSPEAKER_17:  If we didn't have them involved in these city initiatives, we would fail. And what you are doing is undercutting. \nSPEAKER_17:  That important role. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_31:  Good evening. \nSPEAKER_31:  commissioners. My name is Karen Ryside. I'm a resident of the first district. I am president of the Long Beach Grey Panthers and I am a commissioner for LA County on the commission on aging. I thank you for going through this thoughtful process. I'm just going to say it because I've been going to meetings for over 20 years now on Long Beach City Council meetings. \nSPEAKER_31:  And we're going through this process because of one lobbyist, the main lobbyist in Long Beach, had a temper tantrum because he saw that the low income population was gaining enough power to influence decisions that directly impacted them. And I don't know if any of you went through the downtown plan development, but that was an absolute embarrassment to our city. And that was driven by this lobbyist. \nSPEAKER_31:  So you're looking at. \nSPEAKER_31:  small organizations to some larger organizations. \nSPEAKER_31:  Our organization is all volunteers. I don't think we would be impacted by this. \nSPEAKER_31:  ordinance depending on how you word it. \nSPEAKER_31:  But \nSPEAKER_31:  I do all the office work. I cannot, we do so much right now because there's so great a need that we cannot bear the burden of anymore. \nSPEAKER_31:  administrative requirements. We have, thanks to the city, we have an office. \nSPEAKER_31:  at the senior center. So yes, and we lobby. \nSPEAKER_31:  Often and we talked, we do a lot of events. We talked to our council members regularly. We also talked to Congress people and state assembly members and senators. So I want you to just really think about what you're doing because this one person couldn't get his way. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Hello, my name is Van Bui and I work with Long Beach Resents Empowered or Libre. I'm still standing here today in front of you all two months later to urge you all on the ethics commissions to remove these recommendations to include all of 511c3 nonprofits and \nSPEAKER_11:  the term advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_11:  to include advocacy in this ordinance as if it should be conflated with lobbying is inaccurate and inequitable. \nSPEAKER_11:  Non-profit organizations don't have the same capacity nor special interest as paid lobbyists do. \nSPEAKER_11:  We work as partners with the city to strive and work towards social good on issues. \nSPEAKER_11:  such as the current state of emergency on homelessness. \nSPEAKER_11:  We work with community members to advocate for their human rights and needs, and this lobbying ordinance as is would inhibit and hinder our movement. \nSPEAKER_11:  It's also important to note that 513 non-profits already have strict lobbying restrictions from the federal government and already comply with public disclosure laws. \nSPEAKER_11:  that is called lobbying such as the annual 994. \nSPEAKER_11:  This lobbying ordinance was placed even more barriers and take away further from our capacity to work with our communities who are already excluded from these crucial conversations that impact them. \nSPEAKER_11:  This lobbying ordinance is undemocratic and inequitable, which only winds the gap further that already exists for our marginalized community members, who we work with to be able to advocate for themselves. \nSPEAKER_11:  I urge you once again to remove the recommendations to ensure that you are not in the right place. \nSPEAKER_11:  to include these nonprofit organizations and advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_28:  My name is Dubia Flores and I work in Long Beach forward. I'm here today to ask you to please remove the recommendations to include 501C3 nonprofit organizations and advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. The recommendations and latest changes do not address the concerns raised regarding partnership and collaboration with nonprofit organizations and unfairly place more barriers onto community organizations. \nSPEAKER_28:  requiring nonprofit organizations to register as lobbyists and report advocacy directly inhibits and hinders their ability, our ability to achieve mischadriven work. \nSPEAKER_28:  And that long beach forward, our mission is to create a healthy long beach with low income communities of color by building community knowledge, leadership and power. These recommendations will create further burdens to already overburden organizations that are consistently being tasked with fulfilling the gaps that exist within our society and in our own community. Requiring 501C3 nonprofit organizations to register as lobbyists and report advocacy, to support, to support portioned, you get that, impacts communities and residents who are historically not represented or even considered in decision making because of their race, ethnicity, income, gender, sexuality or age. Advocating for people who are left out of the decision making should not make someone be labeled a lobbyist. Again, I'm Nubia Flores, I work at Long Beach Forward, I'm also a resident of Council District 9. I'm a parent advocate, a community organizer, a proud activist, I am not a lobbyist. \nSPEAKER_33:  Good afternoon, my name is Romeo Hebron. I'm the executive director for the Filipino Migrant Center. \nSPEAKER_33:  We're currently partnering with the Long Beach Health Department to conduct a needs assessment with the Filipino community. \nSPEAKER_33:  In recent focus groups, a common sentiment from residents is they feel ignored and forgotten by the city and that resources are not made available to them. \nSPEAKER_33:  As a trusted community messenger, Filipinos know they could come to our organization to express their frustration about gaps and services, and that we could work alongside them to advocate for positive changes by engaging with our elected officials. FMC and many of the organizations here today work tirelessly to improve the lives of Long Beach residents. The in-language materials, translation, and interpretation provided today by the City of Long Beach are a direct result of nonprofits and residents advocating together. This is just one example of many. \nSPEAKER_33:  Non-profits are not the same as paid lobbyists. While we serve the interests of the people, lobbyists serve for their own personal gain or for corporate interests. To lump us into the same category is unethical. \nSPEAKER_33:  Expanding this ordinance to include advocacy is a direct barrier to civic participation and democracy that will prevent the city from working with organizations who want to help address the multitude of issues that are community faces. \nSPEAKER_33:  If the city truly upholds and values the diversity of its residents, that it should ensure that these voices are given a chance to be heard. We ask the ethics commission to maintain the exemption of all the 501C3 non-profit organizations and not include the broad advocacy scope in the key recommendations to the city of Long Beach, loving ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_27:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_27:  My name is Michelle Byerley and I am the Executive Director of the Nonprofit Partnership. Thank you for the additional information on the context of the revisions. \nSPEAKER_27:  Also the understanding that there will be a convening of organizations or those impacted by this ordinance. \nSPEAKER_27:  And I will say that as a non-profit 501-C3 organization, we have had to advocate, not lobby, but advocate for \nSPEAKER_27:  Information sessions like that to include our nonprofit partners because often when we're looking at the economic development of the city Relieving nonprofits out and so that's another example of work that we do as nonprofit organizations That would be limited and halted or create another barrier to Participation understanding of the true needs of the city. So I thank you and we offer our support in those convenings \nSPEAKER_27:  I have time for the rest of my comments. \nSPEAKER_27:  The new requirements as written nonprofits would really hope their work with the city and again speaking to the talking about the grants grants are typically only available to 501c3 organizations. There isn't a lobbying limit on c4 and c6 so by imposing a new lobbying limit on those on 501c3 organizations you're putting their nonprofit status at risk. \nSPEAKER_27:  If we go over our legal limits of lobbying, we will lose our status. And that's what happens statewide and federally with nonprofit status if you're exceeding his lobbying limit. So I just want to ensure that we're not creating another barrier that will put the work of our nonprofits at risk and long beach. \nSPEAKER_27:  You know, we... \nSPEAKER_27:  Back to the equity points I'll try to make this quick. There has been, if the city was operating where there was community input and the voices were fully centered on the community voice and decision making, we would be having a different conversation, but that's just not the reality. And we really need our nonprofits to uplift those challenges and underserved and under resource neighborhoods and building a barrier to this collaboration and these partnerships. \nSPEAKER_27:  Specifically information sharing advocacy and in grants would really have detrimental impact to the intentional work the city is doing. \nSPEAKER_27:  to help the team thrive with nonprofit. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's totally\u0435\u0441\u0442 \nSPEAKER_27:  And again, we offer our support and any convenings that we can as you're learning more about this topic. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_35:  Hello, my name is Hollis Stewart and I live downtown here in Long Beach in Walker Building. \nSPEAKER_35:  and I've been quite involved in a lot of community projects. \nSPEAKER_35:  And I want to say that \nSPEAKER_35:  keeping \nSPEAKER_35:  501-C3. \nSPEAKER_35:  in a situation where they have freedom of speech is very important. \nSPEAKER_35:  We have an article one in the Constitution about freedom of speech. And there's that there for a reason. It was so that the government couldn't be controlled by a small group and everybody else be kept quiet. \nSPEAKER_35:  We have to continue to do that here. \nSPEAKER_35:  And I think you're doing a good job and I'm glad this. \nSPEAKER_35:  You're looking at all these issues in the way you are, but I'll be able to speak. \nSPEAKER_35:  So just protect. \nSPEAKER_35:  All right, to speak here. \nSPEAKER_35:  from 501C3s and other organizations and neighborhood organizations. \nSPEAKER_35:  and associations like the North Pine neighborhood alliance. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, my name is Dizal. I am the Direct Services Manager of the Filipino Migrant Center. \nSPEAKER_01:  And through my role, I see firsthand what issues. \nSPEAKER_01:  low income and migrant. \nSPEAKER_01:  community members and long beach face, such as \nSPEAKER_01:  lack of access to and affordability to fresh food to the point where we have to establish our own Mutual Aid program too. \nSPEAKER_01:  meet with them every week and understand the other issues that they're facing in their lives. \nSPEAKER_01:  such as mental health. \nSPEAKER_01:  due to being understaffed and overworked. \nSPEAKER_01:  and even through family separation through migration. \nSPEAKER_01:  We do. \nSPEAKER_01:  We address these needs through our own efforts by meeting with them regularly. \nSPEAKER_01:  in their homes even. \nSPEAKER_01:  And these recommendations make it difficult for us as a community orb to address these needs because \nSPEAKER_01:  These issues do not align with the paid lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the 501-C3 nonprofit organizations that would be negatively impacted by these recommendations are our own neighbors who seek to better the community not exploited from it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_16:  Good afternoon. My name is Peri Savin-Zant. I'm an equity and inclusion consultant and was even the city's equity toolkit consultant. Until recently I served five years as a technology and innovation commissioner and I'm confident that without the collaboration of long beaches and nonprofits, we wouldn't have been as successful as we were. And the city wouldn't have such a nationally recognized digital inclusion initiative. \nSPEAKER_16:  I'm here to strongly urge the Ethics Commission to remove the ad hoc \nSPEAKER_16:  recommendations to include 501c3 nonprofits and advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_16:  Death Ex-Commission already has beyond sufficient written and verbal testimony from its March meeting and more today that the proposed changes will not only irreversibly and negatively harmed nonprofits but the structurally marked marginalized communities they serve and that the city has a duty to serve. \nSPEAKER_16:  But if this commission is unable to listen to you and respect the voices of community leaders and make the right decision today. \nSPEAKER_16:  Then I asked you now to pause. \nSPEAKER_16:  and work with the Office of Equity to conduct a racial equity analysis of the proposed changes from the AdHoc Committee. And working with Office of Equity is key here because I see community build trust in this office over time. \nSPEAKER_16:  but this commission and ethics officer have not yet built this trust. \nSPEAKER_16:  Nor has the City Manager's office. In fact, the office is true. \nSPEAKER_16:  To not pause and perform the equity analysis would be a breach of their ethical duty under the very ethics code that you have recently revised. \nSPEAKER_16:  I call your attention to the entirety of Section F of the written pledge. \nSPEAKER_16:  and especially F.2, F.3 and F.5. \nSPEAKER_16:  I'm all for added transparency, but that goal must be intentionally balanced with the goals of equity and inclusion, so it's not to cause new harms. And also, there's more ways to equitably, more meaningfully, connect with community than what you all have been led to believe by Deputy City Attorney. Please reach out to the Office of Equity to fully understand your options. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_22:  Good afternoon commissioners. I'm Katherine Miles, the executive director of Tishner Clinic for Children, a nonprofit here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_22:  We provide life-changing services for children with disabilities and their families. Our team and board members are passionate about the work we do. \nSPEAKER_22:  and seek opportunities to raise awareness of the unique challenges experienced by this typically underrepresented population. \nSPEAKER_22:  with the goal of removing barriers and improving access to services. \nSPEAKER_22:  We advocate on behalf of children with disabilities. \nSPEAKER_22:  for the sole purpose of improving the quality of life and empowering their families to do the same. \nSPEAKER_22:  I don't believe our advocacy efforts qualify as lobbying. \nSPEAKER_22:  Our work does not benefit anyone individual, nor is it done for the benefit of our organization. \nSPEAKER_22:  We do this work to benefit the community we serve. \nSPEAKER_22:  It would be unfortunate for nonprofits to limit or cease their collaboration with the city. \nSPEAKER_22:  and are elected officials because they are required to register as lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_22:  especially when most of the advocacy work we engage in is not truly lobbying. \nSPEAKER_22:  We consider the city to be a partner. \nSPEAKER_22:  and having to register as lobbyists would change that relationship significantly. \nSPEAKER_22:  If this recommendation is passed, it will impede nonprofits in bringing about lasting change for the communities we serve. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_25:  Good afternoon commissioners. My name is Marlene Moltenyes, and I'm an Associate Director with Long Beach Forward. \nSPEAKER_25:  Along Beach Forward we'd work to ensure that race and income do not determine its future. \nSPEAKER_25:  in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_25:  and it is disappointing to see \nSPEAKER_25:  The recommendations and latest changes do not address the concerns raised. \nSPEAKER_25:  regarding partnerships and collaboration with nonprofit organizations. \nSPEAKER_25:  and unfairly place more burden. \nSPEAKER_25:  more burdens. \nSPEAKER_25:  Um \nSPEAKER_25:  on community organization. \nSPEAKER_25:  on community organizations. The recommendations send the wrong message to communities and local residents. \nSPEAKER_25:  or working hard to make a difference and care about. \nSPEAKER_25:  working together with the city. \nSPEAKER_25:  Our team at Long Beach Ford plays multiple roles in relationship to City Council offices, including facilitating, interpreting and preparing community partners and members to meet with \nSPEAKER_25:  Electrofacial, many times we are called upon these elected officials. \nSPEAKER_25:  to do this work alongside them. For example, during the pandemic, our team played a key role in outreach and hard-to-reach communities for vaccines. \nSPEAKER_25:  and we co-planned vaccine clinics throughout the city in collaboration with district offices. \nSPEAKER_25:  These recommendations would make urgent and laborious work even more burdensome on our team. \nSPEAKER_25:  Requiringness to register as lobbyists and report advocacy will hinder our abilities to do our driven mission work. Our team works hard. The challenges we work to address are very heavy requiring nonprofit organizations to register as lobbyists and report advocacy will disproportionately impact communities historically not represent it or even consider in decision making because of the race, ethnicity, income, gender, sexuality, and an age. \nSPEAKER_25:  advocating for people who are left out of the decision making. \nSPEAKER_25:  should not make us lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_25:  I recommend that \nSPEAKER_13:  I recommend that \nSPEAKER_25:  I remove their recommendations to include us, nonprofit organizations. \nSPEAKER_25:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_25:  and we are advocates and not lobbyists. \nSPEAKER_24:  Good afternoon, my name is Ariana Kennedy. I just wanted to share as a resident and an employee of a long beach nonprofit, nonprofits are overlooked and continually excluded from public sector decisions unless we involve ourselves in the process. \nSPEAKER_24:  By adding barriers, fewer nonprofits will be able to participate, therefore, fewer community voices will be heard. \nSPEAKER_24:  This is backed up by the work of this specific commission. \nSPEAKER_24:  who looked to LA sat down with the city manager's office. \nSPEAKER_24:  but didn't include those. \nSPEAKER_24:  most affected by this conversation, we had to include ourselves. \nSPEAKER_24:  The same pattern has occurred in the first 100 days. There have been multiple convenings of small businesses to speak with city officials. \nSPEAKER_24:  and nonprofits were not included. \nSPEAKER_24:  I urge you to re-examine adding barriers that will only lessen the community voices in city hall decision making. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you for listening to our comments. \nSPEAKER_18:  My name is Christina Krishvam. I have worked in the non-profit sector in Long Beach for nearly 30 years. \nSPEAKER_18:  20 of those years in violence prevention, non-profit. \nSPEAKER_18:  and the past five with the nonprofit partnership, where annually we work in collaboration with over 500 nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_18:  Now, profits voice the needs of the community, provide for the underserved, we uplift, we appreciate, we heal, and we improve our communities. \nSPEAKER_18:  We do this in collaboration with all stakeholders. \nSPEAKER_18:  community members, teachers, leaders, and yes elected officials. \nSPEAKER_18:  Not profits are not all the same. Different designations have different guidelines. \nSPEAKER_18:  At our nonprofit, we bring in programming for other nonprofits so they fully understand the benefits and yes, the boundaries. \nSPEAKER_18:  of their designation. \nSPEAKER_18:  Compliance and working within the guidelines are built into the many reporting requirements not just from the IRS, but including the IRS. \nSPEAKER_18:  the consequences of not complying with these requirements. \nSPEAKER_18:  is losing tax exempt status. \nSPEAKER_18:  Each designation has different guidelines. 501c4, 6 and 9 are very different. \nSPEAKER_18:  and to group all nonprofits under these new guidelines would bring broad sweeping changes and result in the silencing of many of these voices. \nSPEAKER_18:  The answer to more equity and community input is not by directing energy at the 501-C3 organizations and adding to the burden of requirements. \nSPEAKER_18:  requirements that already include transparency. \nSPEAKER_18:  We believe in creating a space for nonprofits to thrive and we ask that you embrace that too. \nSPEAKER_18:  not in creating an environment of fear, that by doing what we are designed to do, advocating for change, voicing the needs of the community, and bringing about a healthier and safer and more diverse and vibrant community. \nSPEAKER_18:  that by doing these things we run the risk of closing our doors. \nSPEAKER_18:  and our voices silenced. \nSPEAKER_18:  The burden on nonprofits is too great. We look forward to a continued dialogue with you to determine next steps. And we ask that you please, please, listen to the voices of nonprofits. Please do not silence us. \nSPEAKER_32:  Good afternoon members of the commission. My name is James Swazo. First and foremost, I'm a resident of the Sixth District here in Long Beach. I'm also Executive Director of Long Beach Forward where nonprofit here based in the city as well. I want to submit for the record a public comment letter that I believe we all receive via email as well. Signed by 21 nonprofit 501c3 organizations and also submit that to the city clerk for the record as well. I also want to respond to some of the commissioner comments in regards to some of these requirements and recommendations and lift up that we share the goal of transparency. At the end of the day, we also believe that transparency should build bridges and not barriers. One thing I want to really highlight about this is that many of these recommendations are extremely duplicative and cause unintended consequences on nonprofits regardless of their budget size. And I want to be really clear about that. Not only is a lot of this information including what expenditures and amounts are spent on lobbying already disclosed in 990 forms, we already also as registered organizations to do business with the city go through a rigorous process to submit some of this information. And in every bid process, any organization that looks and looks at applications for bids or information is already publicly disclosed whether we choose to or not. So there's a lot of information that we really want to encourage you to learn more about that is already being collected and disclosed that would not create additional burdens on organizations. Second, as I mentioned, I'm a resident of the six district. Last night at 11.30 p.m. on my block, a 12 year old child was killed by gunfire on my street. This is a very serious matter. And the end of the day, if that means that our organization or any group comes to elected officials to any decision making body and advocate for safer streets for more resources and that forces us to be registered as lobbyists. I question and I want to understand and hear from each and every one of you how is that both equitable and how is that ethical? I want to really go back to the question about how do we educate the public about how decision making are being influenced? There's a lot of education and by-on public education, we didn't learn what 990s were. We didn't learn about what nonprofits are. And I think there's a lot of good that we can do to collaborate together and leverage the position that you all have as an ethics commission to actually educate the public about who's making decisions without placing more administrative burdens. Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_14:  990s where we did. \nSPEAKER_29:  Good evening, my name is Samaria. I am a community organizer at Orelay, formerly known as LBRC. \nSPEAKER_29:  I know we've been here for a while hearing everybody's comment and so I'm going to keep it short and sweet. \nSPEAKER_29:  I just got out of the airplane 24 hours ago. I just came from a trip to Sacramento where I was advocating with my team. \nSPEAKER_29:  regarding policies that would benefit on docky-bound immigrants in California. But I remind you are your constituents. \nSPEAKER_29:  I am tired. \nSPEAKER_29:  to have this conversation and have to come back here is quite frankly insulting because you know I won't have to say it again. You know the type of work that everyone in this room does for your constituents. \nSPEAKER_29:  And precisely because you know the importance of the work that we do to even have to discuss something as ridiculous as this. \nSPEAKER_29:  is disturbing. \nSPEAKER_29:  I am tired. I could be home. I could be having meaningful conversations about important matters instead of being here and sending in front of you to have to name the obvious. \nSPEAKER_29:  So do the right thing. \nSPEAKER_29:  and please. \nSPEAKER_29:  stop having such a lack of respect for people's time, energy and resources. \nSPEAKER_34:  Hi, my name is Caitlin Bellis. I'm an attorney and also a resident of Warnbeach. I currently am the policy and community advocacy attorney for the National Integration Project, which is a nonprofit. I'm also on the board of Orelay, which is also a nonprofit. And in both of those capacities, I've appeared in numerous city council meetings, talked with various members of city council, various commission meetings, all of which has been crucial to moving forward policies that will benefit the residents of this city. \nSPEAKER_34:  because I have been in this capacity. \nSPEAKER_34:  Not just in my current role, but also for my entire career, I've been an attorney who works for nonprofit who has some form of advocacy as part of my job. \nSPEAKER_34:  I can personally attest, have many others to be. \nSPEAKER_34:  on our requirements that are already placed on nonprofits to track our time to make sure that we are accurately recording and reporting all of the time that we spend advocating for various issues. \nSPEAKER_34:  Adding another requirement on top of that is going to, as everyone also said, really frustrate our ability to do the work that we're supposed to do, which is to come and talk about the issues that affect people in this community. And so I think \nSPEAKER_34:  I think you're going to have the same from like 20 more people. And I would just really strongly recommend that you withdraw the lobbyist ordinance recommendation. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Good evening everybody, my name is Jamele and I'm a senior organizer with Orale. I've been organizing with Long Beach for over six years as a student and four years with Orale. And until today, I have seen very little progress when it comes to making Long Beach City Council and just Long Beach anything that he related more accessible to community members. Such small things that are really big in my opinion get overlooked. \nSPEAKER_02:  Agendas are in English. \nSPEAKER_02:  Not having interpretation available? \nSPEAKER_02:  The language using these meetings are not community friendly. \nSPEAKER_02:  because of these decisions. \nSPEAKER_02:  and access. \nSPEAKER_02:  A lot of the city council do not often include community voice or the invitations never actually make it to the neighborhoods unless they're invited by nonprofits that are here today. \nSPEAKER_02:  Organization continues to push the city in a direction that not only includes but is driven by community members. \nSPEAKER_02:  leadership. \nSPEAKER_02:  Our community members are empowered by organization to hold City accountable to prioritizing the most marginalized communities. \nSPEAKER_02:  I have lost count of how many monolingual Spanish speaking, low income immigrant women, I have organized to have entered the Long Beach City Council chambers for the first time. Even more so, how many of them have only attended their first meeting with council members for the very first time. And so many of them that have still not even met their own council members because of the language inaccessibility. \nSPEAKER_02:  I point this out because we have been committed to empowering immigrants in Long Beach to advocate for resources needed in our cities through budget advocacy. \nSPEAKER_02:  Our work is driven by community and for community. As nonprofits, we don't have any financial incentive or gain when we lobby. \nSPEAKER_02:  We are lobbying informed by the needs of community members who continue to be excluded. We're asking the City Ethics Commission to continue exempting nonprofits from existing lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_38:  Sorry, hey, all my names are in. \nSPEAKER_38:  Um. \nSPEAKER_38:  Everybody said a lot of what I was gonna say so I don't want to echo too much other than to say that \nSPEAKER_38:  Um \nSPEAKER_38:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_38:  I'm also with Orale, which is previously the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. And so I think this feels like a catch-all in the interest of transparency. So I think I can recognize the sort of like well intention there, though I think \nSPEAKER_38:  It'd be better suited for this commission to identify the issue that you have. Like, where is it that you want the transparency from whom on what issues? And like really dig into that and like not sort of, because there's so many folks here at the table that are going to be impacted by this. And I don't think anybody understands your motive. And so like, what are you trying to get at and do that and have that show through the process? I would suggest. And I think, \nSPEAKER_38:  Because not all organizations are going to be impacted the same way. \nSPEAKER_38:  I think, and if you are so interested in that reporting, \nSPEAKER_38:  My suggestion would be to take that to the city and the city should bear the brunt. Like your recommendations to say that the city should bear the brunt of the cost administratively, financially, whatever it takes to run these reportings. Like, Yasha, bear the brunt. If you're so interested in that transparency, then have the city stand on it. And that way we can continue to operate the way we have. And you get this transparency that feels like to me, or at least I hope, is where this is coming from. \nSPEAKER_05:  Good evening, my name is Myra Fernanda, and I am a District 2 resident and the lead organizer for Long Beach residents empowered. 501-C3 nonprofit organizations are inherently different from paid lobbyists who serve special interest clients, because our mission is to serve communities in need and provide a social good, not to make a profit. It's thanks to nonprofit organizations like Libre, whose focus is literally tenant empowerment, our way renters in Long Beach feel empowered enough and supported enough to be able to share their stories and struggles within the city of Long Beach, and making sure that their stories are reaching council members' ears. When we show up to the chambers, we show up as renters, as neighbors, as residents and constituents of the city of Long Beach. Expanding the scope of the ordinance to include advocacy is a direct barrier to civic participation and democracy that will prevent the city of Long Beach from working with organizations who want to help address homelessness, poverty, and quality of life issues. Stop continuing to further marginalize our communities. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Antes de que empiece mi tiempo, quiero poner dos quejas por discriminaci\u00f3n. \nSPEAKER_05:  So before my time starts, I want to submit two complaints of discrimination. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hace tres a\u00f1os hablamos con la se\u00f1orita que presente de Adea. \nSPEAKER_05:  Three years ago, we spoke with Heather from ADA. \nSPEAKER_07:  El muchacho de blanco que est\u00e1 y ha sentado es mi hijo. \nSPEAKER_05:  The voice sitting in the back of the chambers is my son. \nSPEAKER_07:  solicitamos el bot\u00f3n para que se abriuran estas fuerzas autom\u00e1ticamente ya que les completamente discapacitados. \nSPEAKER_05:  We solicited that a button for ADA be placed in front of the chambers to be able to open the door. He has 16 disabilities and can't enter the chambers without help. \nSPEAKER_07:  Dicen que estos ba\u00f1os son inclusivos, no hay donde le cambia el pa\u00f1uel. \nSPEAKER_05:  We are told that the City Council chambers have inclusive bathrooms. There is nowhere for us to change a stiffer other than on the floor. \nSPEAKER_07:  y la siguiente que esa es porque no tienen un traductor. \nSPEAKER_07:  Calificado para que yo pueda hablar a tu \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  My second complaint is why do we not have a qualified interpreter so that I can speak here today? \nSPEAKER_07:  Ahora s\u00ed podemos empezar mi tiempo. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now we can start my time. \nSPEAKER_07:  time. \nSPEAKER_07:  Gracias a estas organizaciones como libre, Lombish Forward, Tuegner, Topede Clinic y todas las dem\u00e1s que est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed. Yo tengo un techo hoy donde vivir. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you to organizations like Long Beach Forward, Long Beach residents empowered, and Tushna Orthopedic Clinic, and all other nonprofits organizations here today, is the reason why I have a roof over my head. \nSPEAKER_07:  Tuve una... \u00bfC\u00f3mo se dice? Cuando te quinas ac\u00e1. \nSPEAKER_05:  I had an eviction order. \nSPEAKER_05:  Enquisar... \nSPEAKER_07:  together. \nSPEAKER_05:  That was Unchirky by... \nSPEAKER_05:  because I called the city on my \nSPEAKER_05:  property management and on my property owner because I had a roach infestation in my unit. \nSPEAKER_07:  Inmediatamente tuve una orden de salojo por hacer eso. \nSPEAKER_05:  I immediately received an eviction order in retaliation to submit in a complaint. \nSPEAKER_07:  Pues que ayuda del... Mi distrito dos, nadie me ayud\u00f3. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  I asked for a \nSPEAKER_05:  help to my former representative of City Council District 2 and no one helped me. \nSPEAKER_07:  Sin embargo, las peque\u00f1as organizaciones, como las que ya nombr\u00e9, vinieron a dar la voz por m\u00ed y me ayudaron en mi proceso. \nSPEAKER_05:  However, these small organizations that are here before you are the ones that came and showed their face in City Hall and advocated for me. \nSPEAKER_07:  Me da verg\u00fcenza que no es la primera vez que para el concilio por no tener traducci\u00f3n. \nSPEAKER_05:  and you all should be ashamed that this is not the first time that I've had to stop someone in city council because there is not appropriate translation. \nSPEAKER_07:  Si no tenemos estas organizaciones, no hay nadie que decida a nuestros derechos. Gracias. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  organizations we have no one that can defend our rights for us. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_37:  Hello, and thank you for listening to our comments today. My name is Gray Manke and I'm a resident of Long Beach as well as a program coordinator for the Nonprofit Partnership. \nSPEAKER_37:  I'm here today to ask you not to include the 501C3 nonprofit organizations or advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_37:  City of Long Beach has recently partnered with a number of nonprofit organizations to reduce and address the impact of COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_37:  on the most at-risk, historically underserved. \nSPEAKER_37:  and under-resource populations among each. \nSPEAKER_37:  The city partners with nonprofit organizations because they know that nonprofits have built trust within communities and can provide \nSPEAKER_37:  and can provide intentional and equitable service. \nSPEAKER_37:  This revision to the lobbying ordinance creates uncertainty about interacting with the city at all. \nSPEAKER_37:  Because of the threat this poses to an organization 501C3 status, this will limit or even stop partnerships with nonprofits across the city. \nSPEAKER_37:  Please. \nSPEAKER_37:  I asked that you please keep partnerships between the city and nonprofits alive and do not impose the revisions to this ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_23:  Good afternoon. My name is Gregory Johnson. I am a resident of Long Beach, a business owner in Long Beach, and the board of board president for the Arts Council for Long Beach. I'm here today to stand with our friends. Everything that we really need to say is been said by Mr. Swazo of Long Beach forward, so we'll just echo that. But I also want to, you to consider, nonprofits like the Arts Council for Long Beach, our primary client is the City of Long Beach. So how do we do the work for our client, the City of Long Beach, to advocate for arts and culture in this city if we cannot have open communication with our elected officials? Does the, do these restrictions also operate the opposite way? Oftentimes, the City Council members need to address some topics of arts and culture in their various districts, and they need to have a meeting with us. Do they also too need to register in order to have a conversation with us? And lastly, when you have your community meetings or open forums or whatever it is that you all decide should be that procedure at the end of the day, as you do your fact finding, I don't have the data, but are there other nonprofits in the city whose primary client and service area is to do the bidding of the city and these elected, you know, are you able to \nSPEAKER_23:  come to a finding where you are able to apply these restrictions or rules or whatever it is that you all want to do with ethics. Two public corporations are nonprofit corporations like the Arts Council for Long Beach. I will share with you that we too were in Sacramento very recently advocating for arts and culture as part of a larger statewide arts and culture advocacy event. We spoke to our local officials that were there in state government to make sure that they kept an eye out for specific bills and what not that are passing out there for our city. And we want to make sure that those funds as an example, Prop 28 getting down to the schools. Do our schools have enough arts and culture funding to conduct arts and culture in the schools? We got to be able to talk to our elected officials blessings. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Hello, my name is Carla and I'm a community organizer for Long Beach Forward. And I am here today to ask that you remove the recommendation to include 501C3 Non-Properate Organizations Advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_10:  Advocating for the needs of our community, advocating for the needs our community deserves should not require, require us to be labeled as lobbyists. We are not the same as a community organizer. My main and only mission is to empower and serve our underserved communities, not to make a profit for my community's hardships. \nSPEAKER_10:  We see our community members as leaders, experts, and as humans, not as dollar signs. Recreting us to register as lobbyists will create a lot of confusion and mistrust in our communities. We have worked really hard to build these relationships with our office and forgotten long beach community members. \nSPEAKER_10:  For the past two years, my team and I have door knocked and talked to more than 20,000 Long Beach households. We have had many long emotional but needed conversations with these community members. We have heard the community needs and let me tell you this, our community needs more bridges not barriers. \nSPEAKER_10:  They need more community organizers who will empower them, not lobbyists who exploit their stories. So again, I'm here to remind you that we are not lobbyists and that our time, effort and hard work should go towards our communities. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Good afternoon everyone, my name is Joanna Diaz and I am the Civic Engagement Program Manager with Long Beach Forward. \nSPEAKER_09:  I've been a Long Beach community member for over 15 years and started off as a student who had dire concerns with what I saw going on in our community. I then became a volunteer with the local nonprofit who is here this evening. \nSPEAKER_09:  and found my voice and embrace that power that we as a community deserve to have. \nSPEAKER_09:  It was through my years of working in partnership with local nonprofits in 501C3s that I saw the need for organizers who are rooted in community. \nSPEAKER_09:  As a result of the support from that organization, I was able to make the transition to work at a grassroots local nonprofit and have been committed to uplift the voices of those who are intentionally excluded and underrepresented in city decision making processes like these. \nSPEAKER_09:  It is literally my job to ensure that our organization works with and for long beach residents to support and uplift their voices. The voices of community members who make long beach what it is today, the same community members you have each committed to represent. \nSPEAKER_09:  As a facilitator of the Language Justice Coalition, it is also my job to ensure that community members are literally heard. \nSPEAKER_09:  in these spaces because of that I have to take this moment to push your commission to make the necessary requests to provide the interpretation and translation that our community deserves at your meetings moving forward. \nSPEAKER_09:  All that said, the work of a 501c3 nonprofit organization is by law designed to serve the most vulnerable within society and our community, many of whom are historically and purposefully left out of decision making due to discrimination, language, and cultural barriers that you heard about this evening. And fear of retaliation based off of our lived experiences here in Long Beach in recent years. Comparing the influence of a 501c3 nonprofit organization to paid lobbyists, that lobby for personal wealth. \nSPEAKER_09:  or for the profit of a corporate interest is unethical, inequitable, and quite frankly, dangerous and offensive. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good afternoon ethics commissioners. I am Reverend Mary Jung. I am a senior organizer with crew, clergy and lay it united for economic justice. And I represent hundreds of faith leaders connected through crew across Los Angeles and Orange counties who are committed to walking with workers, immigrants, and marginalized communities in their struggle for dignity and justice. \nSPEAKER_00:  As an interfaith organization, we believe in the faith value of speaking truth to power as a prophetic witness in society. And we have seen this prophetic witness in the civilized movement. Faith leaders across spiritual traditions came together to advocate with elected officials for the end of segregation laws and legal discrimination and secure voting rights for the Black community. Without these numerous conversations between elected officials and nonprofits like SCOC and Christian leadership's conference representing the Black community, the US would not be in the place where we are today. The current recommendations will not help build fruitful relationships for such transformation between the city and nonprofits, working alongside vulnerable community members. We all know that trust takes time to build and the recommendations will limit the ability for the city officials to build trust and to make relationships with the community and address their concerns in a timely manner. During the pandemic, Clue was working with the LA County to educate low-income faith communities about COVID issues and provide them PPE and healing resources. The recommendations will not allow us to effectively collaborate with the city for the good of our communities. So I ask that you will remove the recommendations to include 501C3 nonprofit organizations and advocacy in the lobbying ordinance. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  Hello, my name is Christina Hall. Currently, I work with the nonprofit partnership here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_15:  but have been a community activist for over two decades in both Orange County and L.A. County. \nSPEAKER_15:  Just yesterday, literally yesterday, I without a conference and heard. \nSPEAKER_15:  from Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon. \nSPEAKER_15:  and the LA Mayor Karen Beth, how much they count on the communication with nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_15:  to make their decisions. \nSPEAKER_15:  and to know what's going on in their community. \nSPEAKER_15:  Yet today I'm here. \nSPEAKER_15:  Having to speak to you all. \nSPEAKER_15:  because you didn't listen last time we were here. \nSPEAKER_15:  That is really disturbing to me. \nSPEAKER_15:  I would like to share an example with you, though, of why I feel this way. \nSPEAKER_15:  I have taken many women and dads. \nSPEAKER_15:  on their first visit. \nSPEAKER_15:  Two City Council members. \nSPEAKER_15:  assembly people. \nSPEAKER_15:  state senators. \nSPEAKER_15:  And that was our first. \nSPEAKER_15:  visit to ever share their voice. \nSPEAKER_15:  Maybe it was our second visit. \nSPEAKER_15:  Hand holding someone. \nSPEAKER_15:  and going to have their voice heard. \nSPEAKER_15:  is not the same. It's apples and oranges from the example you put up here. \nSPEAKER_15:  of having an university that wants to build a second campus within a city. \nSPEAKER_15:  That university is really going to hire a lobbyist to really get into the door. They're not the same. That is apples and oranges to the nonprofits that are in this room. \nSPEAKER_15:  If you continue to want to go down this path, \nSPEAKER_15:  I would share and echo the easiest way to get the transparency you're looking for is to have the City Council members and decision-makers in the city track their meetings with us and share that information with you. \nSPEAKER_15:  rather than having the burden placed on us. \nSPEAKER_15:  I'm here today talking to you instead of being at my desk helping community in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  flows in a gut machine andations taken are defined, realized at the time. One condition, including a state where\u4f60\u770bing Taiwan, and its \nSPEAKER_26:  Good afternoon commissioners. \nSPEAKER_26:  My name is Violet Brown and I'm speaking to you today as a board member of the Arts Council for Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  As someone who is dedicated 14 years to supporting Long Beach by volunteering and helping make Long Beach the community it is today. \nSPEAKER_26:  I am incredibly disappointed that this commission has failed to hear the voices of our non-profits in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  the proposed inclusion of nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_26:  And the new lobbyists ordinance is a punishment for the investments we make in vulnerable communities. \nSPEAKER_26:  oftentimes at our local government's request. \nSPEAKER_26:  because frankly we are better equipped and better trained to handle the challenges on the ground. \nSPEAKER_26:  Many local nonprofits, including the Arts Council for Long Beach, have existing contracts with the City of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  which by their nature require extensive. \nSPEAKER_26:  communication with elected leaders and city staff. \nSPEAKER_26:  the proposed inclusion. \nSPEAKER_26:  of local nonprofits in this ordinance. \nSPEAKER_26:  will make that work virtually impossible for us. \nSPEAKER_26:  Additionally, a vast majority of our organizations serve as pass-throughs to help deliver funds to other non-profits within Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  For example, the arts council of Long Beach recently distributed over $600,000 in grants. \nSPEAKER_26:  to other nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_26:  to local artists and organizations. \nSPEAKER_26:  Most of that money is not our own, but that of the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  the California Arts Council and others in which in turn we disperse to supporting the others within Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_26:  Non-profits are already subject to high levels of scrutiny. \nSPEAKER_26:  and regulation by the IRS. \nSPEAKER_26:  due to their tax exempt status. \nSPEAKER_26:  They have to comply with a lot of reporting and disclosure requirements to maintain their nonprofit status. \nSPEAKER_26:  adding them to the lobbyist ordinance would only increase their compliance burden. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_26:  and ironically. \nSPEAKER_26:  create a taxpayer-funded bureaucracy for tax exempt organizations. \nSPEAKER_26:  501 organizations or charitable organizations that exist to serve the public good, not to promote their own self-interest. \nSPEAKER_26:  They don't have shareholders or owners who benefit financially from their activities. \nSPEAKER_26:  So there's no motive for them to use their resources to implement public officials. \nSPEAKER_00:  to implement. \nSPEAKER_26:  Um. \nSPEAKER_26:  At this time, I just want to say thank you for hearing us today and I hope that you will do something to help us. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Hello members of the Ethics Commission. My name is Jason Medecado, and I am a resident of Council District 2, and I'm also a volunteer with Libre or Long Beach residents empowered. I am here to request for the Ethics Commission to remove the recommendations to include the 501-C3 nonprofit organizations and advocacy and lobbying ordinance. \nSPEAKER_12:  The recommendation sends the wrong message to local residents who are working hard to make a difference and care about working together with the city. Through Libre, I've connected with tenants across the city, fighting for low income renters to have a safer living conditions and not to be displaced from their homes. \nSPEAKER_12:  Experiences from my neighbors in low income marginalized communities have historically been left out of the policy making process. Non-profits help us draw that power from our experiences and use our voices to advocate for the change we need in our city. \nSPEAKER_12:  Please don't make it harder for our communities and nonprofits to advocate for the change we need. I joined with the folks here today urging the Ethics Commission to maintain the existing nonprofit exemption in its lobbying ordinance so that we may continue to voice our concerns of the community and remember as well. \nSPEAKER_12:  build bridges. \nSPEAKER_12:  Not barriers. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_36:  Hello. My name is Andrea Donado and I am the director of the Long Beach Residence in Powered, or Libre. \nSPEAKER_36:  I'm here to urge that this commission to maintain the existing nonprofit exception in its loving ordinance. \nSPEAKER_36:  We are currently trying to prevent increase of homelessness. \nSPEAKER_36:  humanitarian crisis that affects everyone. \nSPEAKER_36:  Our staff is already burdened by the hundreds of calls from renters in distress and on the blink of getting elicted from their homes. \nSPEAKER_36:  We need their experiences to reach these chambers so that they can better advocate \nSPEAKER_36:  for the protections tenets in our city need and deserve. \nSPEAKER_36:  The voices of low income and marginalized communities are often excluded from this policy-making process, and eliminating the nonprofit exception will further tie the hands of organizations, fighting for the inclusion and protections that this community deserves. \nSPEAKER_36:  At least five Libre staff members are here today trying to protect the rights of those we represent and work for. During this time, we could have held at least ten community members from being evicted. Imagine the damage this will make if we had to report any meeting that we have with elected officials to protect them. \nSPEAKER_36:  Please keep the nonprofit exemption. \nSPEAKER_36:  So community advocate. \nSPEAKER_36:  can continue doing their work. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  Thank you, everyone, for your comments. Taylor, well, you were out. A question came up about what type of meeting we could have. Public meeting where we would just take comments like this versus a community meeting where the staff would be able to dialogue and interact more with the community. And Commissioner Weiss has had some questions about the Brown Act and why it limits our ability. And I think the comments that we've heard today kind of reflect what most of us are feeling. There were people who came up that I would have loved to have asked follow up questions, but we're just not, at least under what we've been told, we're not allowed to have that type of interaction. So Commissioner Weiss, do you want to expand a little bit further on what your question was? \nSPEAKER_21:  I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_21:  My question had to do with, as long as the discussion stays on topic. So if the discussion is about the proposed ordinance and that the purpose of the ordinance is to try to increase transparency about the communications and the influence that nonprofits have on electives. As long as everyone stays on that topic, can there not be an exchange? I looked at the materials you sent and I didn't see, I saw that there were warnings about people going off topic and anytime anybody comes to the mic in a public meeting, there is that danger, there is a danger that right now I will start talking about the Mississippi River or something. And you would say that's not on the agenda, so don't talk about that. But as long as I talk about the item that's on the agenda and can we ask questions and have a dialogue with people speaking to us. \nSPEAKER_21:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  So the answer is yes, and I talked through this with the chair. In theory, under the Brown Act, you can have a question and answer exchange. The problem that the city has found historically in allowing that type of activity is that it requires a significant amount of trust not only of the public but commissioners that everybody stays in line with what the agenda item is, and the reason for that is, \nSPEAKER_08:  If you start talking about things that are off agenda, and the place where this happens the most is non-agenda public comment, where someone comes to the mic and they want to talk about something that's within your purview that's very concerning, but it wasn't on the agenda for the evening. The opportunity to violate the Brown Act and begin a discussion that is outside the scope is fairly high, and part of the problem with that is that we have the rules in the Brown Act and 72 hours notice and all of these requirements, number one for transparency, and then number two to ensure that all of the members of the public who want to be present and have that discussion can be present. It's not fair if you start talking about the Mississippi River and there were people in the community where that's a priority to them, they're not able to be here. So that's where the basis of the rules are. \nSPEAKER_08:  If the commission understands those parameters, we have to set rules in place of what that looks like, right? \nSPEAKER_08:  What the question and answer portion looks like. There's also an issue with fairness, not just under the Brown Act, that some people may be given more time on the floor, rather than others. And so, the commissioners may have less questions for certain people rather than others, which is why we usually recommend that those things are handled in a community meeting, where there can be less than a quorum of the body, and... \nSPEAKER_08:  There's not that burden and risk of violating the Brown Act. I think the other issue too is we would have to talk through what the question and answer session would look like. \nSPEAKER_08:  and then whether \nSPEAKER_08:  or not an additional period of public comment would be necessary, right, to make sure that everybody's being given an opportunity to speak. It potentially sets up that there would be two opportunities to provide public comment. So there are a lot of logistical things that we would need to talk through to make sure that we were doing things in compliance with the Brown Act, which is why we typically, not number one, we looked through the record. I don't think any commission has ever... \nSPEAKER_08:  undergone this effort because of \nSPEAKER_08:  the things that I've discussed here. That's why it's usually done in a community meeting where there can be a question and answer, but that requires of course always staff time and facility facilitating it and noticing it. \nSPEAKER_08:  I know in email you had asked about the redistricting commission, all of the hearings and hearing from the community from the redistricting commission, that happened on the record in a Brown Act notice meeting. They all of the feedback they got from the community was done in a Brown Act meeting. So it's not to say that we can't do it, we don't recommend doing it because there's a significant amount of challenges with facilitating a Brown Act meeting that involves question and answers with the public. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's something to consider. \nSPEAKER_08:  you know, one of the suggestions that I had provided to the chair was if you have questions of the community, \nSPEAKER_08:  I think a brief exchange clarifying questions are usually okay, but if you guys have general questions for the community about the types of things that you want to hear from them, we can \nSPEAKER_08:  put them up on the screen so that it's readily apparent. The types of information the commission would like. I know it's \nSPEAKER_08:  It's a lot to come up and publicly speak and remember what the Commission asked of you. So like, I think that there's some opportunities. \nSPEAKER_08:  to help facilitate the kinds of information that you want from the public. So \nSPEAKER_08:  Hopefully that helps to clarify why. \nSPEAKER_08:  That we generally recommend if you look at other jurisdictions also They have rules and ordinances that prohibit council members and commissioners from exchanging with The public for this reason So Long Beach hasn't codified it, but as a general practice. This is how the city has operated as far as I was able to tell \nSPEAKER_21:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  So as Taylor said, we could do a public hearing, which... \nSPEAKER_19:  If that's the route we go, one of the suggestions that she and I had talked about is maybe coming up with three questions that we would like everyone who comes and interacts in that contemplate in terms of the information that we're soliciting. \nSPEAKER_19:  We understand the difference between an advocate and a lobbyist. I think it was in our last report that we had requested legal opinion from outside council to make sure that whatever we set up does not impact any 501c3s. \nSPEAKER_19:  legal standing as a 501c3 as we do this. But we also recognize that you as advocates are providing some vital information. \nSPEAKER_19:  that could be shared and possibly should be shared with the public. You know, some of you came up and spoke today about things that your organization is doing that I think the other people in the community would be interested in hearing. So that's one of the reasons that when I spoke at the beginning of the meeting, I talked about if there's something that you don't think works as we go forward into our future meetings and that would probably be question number one. If you think that we've set the threshold too low, too high, not in the right jurisdiction for what we are calling advocates. We're not calling you lobbyists. We're calling you advocates because we understand that you are advocating on behalf of the community and that you're advocating to make the community a holistically helpful place for everyone that lives here. \nSPEAKER_19:  So if what we're doing is not getting there, how do we make sure that the information that you're sharing with the decision makers that could change the minds of other people in our community? Could help other people in our community also understand better what is happening in our community? How do we get that shared with them? So if you could take that with you and think about that as we get ready for our meetings. Any public meeting that we're gonna have is probably not gonna be until later June. There's just not enough time to set it up for the latter part of this month. We have our regular meeting and we don't wanna do this as part of our regular meeting. We really wanna do this and there may be two, there may be three. We may need to move within the community so that people really have the opportunity to come and talk to us about what they think of this. And maybe there are people that are not affiliated with the nonprofits or the lobbyists who have thoughts about what information they want to see as being shared. We want the community as a whole to really look at this and tell us what is the information that's being provided to our city staff and our elected officials that we want to know as being provided with them, to them. So on that basis to the fellow commissioners, does anyone have any thoughts about what they would like to see as a meeting going forward? I don't think that the ad hoc is going to get together and do any more work on the recommendations that we have to date. I think that if it's up to you as to whether or not you want to see this go forward, you want to send it back to the commission based on the public comment. So really there are kind of three items I see that we need to talk about. Do you want the recommendations to go back to the ad hoc and for them to do additional work on it or do you want this to go what goes forward and whatever hearing that we have going forward? Do you want to see a community hearing or a public hearing? And then the third one, as Taylor had indicated, there's going to be a lot of logistics. Would you delegate the setting up of those logistics to the vice chair and I to work with the staff? \nSPEAKER_19:  And if there are specific questions that you think we should have in those. \nSPEAKER_19:  Please talk about them now also so that we can, the Vice-Chairn, I can make sure that those get into the record as we go forward. \nSPEAKER_19:  So does anyone want to start the discussion? \nSPEAKER_19:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Taylor, for that breakdown. I just want to make sure I'm following. When you said that it is possible for there to be more of a dialogue, if the commission attends some sort of community meeting in a capacity where we're less than the full seven, what kind of dialogue exactly are we talking about there? Because that would seem to be a material improvement. I think the logistical challenges that you spoke to, I think the turnout we've had at the two meetings where this has been on the agenda, say to me, just speaking personally, that those challenges are worth undertaking to try to get a little more of a dialogue, but I want to make sure I fully understand if, for example, three of us were to attend community meeting one, seems to reason, then, that we would need to have a different subset, maybe attend a second community meeting, but to get kind of full exposure of the full commission to the feedback from the community and have more of a back and forth, but I want to make sure that's something we are actually able to do, because that will just sort of, to answer the Chair's question, that'll help me sort of think through what you know, vote for as far as how to move forward. \nSPEAKER_08:  So. \nSPEAKER_08:  I wouldn't recommend breaking it up into groups of commissioners. I would recommend the same group of commissioners goes out and does the work. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think we could, this would be up to staff and I don't want to promise you something that's not possible. I think staff would need to get back to you. But the possibility of, you know, if we held it in a space where there could potentially be a recording of the meeting, at least an audio recording of the meeting, maybe not a video recording of the meeting. \nSPEAKER_08:  for the other commissioners to be able to listen to the meeting. I think that that would be an option so you could still hear the feedback but not risk participating in any way. The reason that I advise against more than three of you undergoing this effort is you might inadvertently \nSPEAKER_08:  start violating the Brown Act making decisions amongst you and we don't want that so it's to protect you As far as the question and answer part is concerned In the discussion I think community meetings provide for more of a free flow of information so We could talk about how to set it up, but you could engage and I think the question and answer portion Where you feel limited right now, right? So if someone says something and you want them to expand on it \nSPEAKER_08:  they could provide more details on it. But I think that we still have an issue of fairness, so making sure that \nSPEAKER_08:  We're providing an opportunity in noticing in a way that all stakeholders are able to come and be present and represent their views, not just one part of the community that's affected by whatever decision that you're making. And that's true for any decision that you're making and undergoing this type of effort. \nSPEAKER_04:  Understood. Thank you. With that in mind then \nSPEAKER_04:  That proposal is workable for me. I understand that there's probably no perfect solution, but I would like to do anything we can to facilitate a little bit more of a dialogue. We've heard great feedback. I think it's at the point now where some questions and answers might really help move this forward. I don't want to throw up suggestions about which three would be doing that, but to the extent that any three members of the Commission would \nSPEAKER_04:  I guess volunteer or be designated to attend one of those meetings and the rest are relegated to listening via audio. I am okay with that. I would prefer that than another notice meeting where we're sitting here as a full group of seven, but then we cannot. We can't sort of pitch questions and receive feedback and we're burdening folks to kind of present written statements and the dialogue is limited. So that's just my... \nSPEAKER_04:  preference. I don't know if I've answered all of the chair's questions, but that's kind of my initial thought on what would be the best thing to kind of do is a next step. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, Chair. I would be interested in the commission having a community meeting. I do agree on the idea of getting more of a dialogue or having the opportunity for a dialogue. If we were to do such a thing, I'd be interested in learning more. And part of this could come from staff in advance at how we might go through or do equity analysis, because I do very much appreciate the concerns about marginalization and want to make sure that that's being addressed. And ways that we would be able to obtain transparency without the burden. And I do believe that, quite some time ago, I made a ask a question at one of our meetings about whether the burden should be on the individuals making the communication or if it's more appropriate to put the burden on those who are in the elected offices or the appointed offices. I believe that comment was made at least once today. And I'd like to also learn more and understand more about that. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  follow up. That was a question I also echoed at the last meeting I think February or March where this was on the agenda. I shared the same thought that Commissioner Shotwell has previously shared. So I think clearly that's still on the minds of some of the, excuse me, folks of the commission. I would be interested in hearing more from the folks who have chosen to speak here. So I think a dialogue on that and many other issues is appropriate. I remember now Chair, you had said if the commission, if we're comfortable delegating some of that scheduling to you and the vice chair, just speaking for me, I am. And so I just wanted to make that make that clear. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  Thank you commissioners. \nSPEAKER_19:  Anyone else? \nSPEAKER_19:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_23:  MBC \ub274\uc2a4 \uae40 \nSPEAKER_21:  Is the issue that you're talking about, the one about the electance, is that the issue? Or is that the issue? Yeah, just. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, just to the extent that there's going to be a disclosure of more communications, just hypothetically speaking, on whom should that burden be placed? Should it be placed on the organizations that have come to speak before us today and similar, similarly situated organizations or conversely the folks on the other end of those same communications, namely the elected officials or the representatives in the city that are meeting with these organizations. I think a couple people have raised that in passing. I asked that question to that effect. What would people's thoughts be on a situation similar to that? No commissioner shot well has raised that in the past. So that's the general thinking behind that. And I know that the ad hoc has taken that into account to a certain degree, but maybe we need to have more of a back and forth discussion to try to sort of, again, move that forward. \nSPEAKER_21:  Okay, do you answer my question on that? I guess another question I would have is if we, I think this, however this setup, there should be some way has to be developed for the questions that the commission would want asked are collected somehow from us. And I don't know if we're ready today to put those lists together if there's a way \nSPEAKER_21:  or whether we can just submit them all to staff and then the groups that is going to do it can decide which ones to ask. Because while I've been listening, I've been making a list of questions that in the margins that I have that I would like the issues that I would like to be to have further discussion on or input from the community or whoever wants to speak to us. So somehow those questions have to be developed and at least I would want to have input into those regardless of whether I was one of the people going to the meeting. \nSPEAKER_19:  And we could do that the same way we've done with other things. And at each person we would set a date by which you would need to have your questions to staff. And then we would call those over and merge them together into a list. Because we don't want too many questions, probably like three. \nSPEAKER_04:  some of them will be included. \nSPEAKER_19:  Yeah, I think a lot of them will be duplicative. \nSPEAKER_19:  Are there any other comments? Does anyone have a motion? \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay, so let me take a shot then that Taylor helped me if I go astray here. So the motion would be to receive and file the report of the ad hoc committee on lobbying. \nSPEAKER_00:  So. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  So let me. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_19:  Direct this. \nSPEAKER_19:  chair and the vice chair to work with staff on the development of \nSPEAKER_19:  a community dialogue, community meeting process. \nSPEAKER_19:  with one or more meetings to be conducted depending upon what \nSPEAKER_19:  those people, the Tarenite Vice-Taren, or I am the chair, and the Vice-Tarenite come up with. \nSPEAKER_19:  Um \nSPEAKER_19:  I think for continuity sake we would designate the three members unless there's somebody who want because I would be willing to step back if there's one of the other commissioners that would like to be there at the meetings but it would be the ad hoc unless somebody would like to take my place. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm comfortable with the three of you attending. You guys have done great work on this stuff thus far. I'm happy to be listening to the dialogue remotely or however it's set up. \nSPEAKER_19:  So the three commissioners that would attend the community meetings with the staff would be \nSPEAKER_19:  Commissioner Weiss, the Vice Chair, and myself. \nSPEAKER_19:  And then \nSPEAKER_19:  Each member of the commission is asked to submit the questions that we would want to present to the community for contemplation in advance of those meetings within the next 10 days. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  Do I have a second? Do you want to add something? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think they forget something. Commissioner Chattel's point on looking into the exit. \nSPEAKER_19:  I was going to do that as part of what we do. We will also send this to staff. So that could be part of this motion also to ask staff to have an equity analysis done this in advance of our meeting. Do we think that they could get that done? \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, yes. And I was. \nSPEAKER_03:  and24 KrankenhausenLaW \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  Bye, mid-June. \nSPEAKER_31:  We can ask them, we can ask them. \nSPEAKER_19:  And you know what, if they can't, then we can at least tell the community that they're working on it and we can also kind of push back our meeting based on when they think they could get that to us so that it be sent for an equity analysis. Did we hit everything there? Is there a second? Wait, Commissioner Chattlotte? Well, it's something. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't know if it's off point or if there is an element of germainness, is there any benefit to also including or getting input from the city's commission on equity and inclusion. \nSPEAKER_19:  I think that's what we would be doing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  That's what we just added in on this show. \nSPEAKER_06:  So what at my point was we consider that commission. Okay. \nSPEAKER_30:  So it would be the commission or the staff? Well, the way you framed it, it would be staff. If you want to refer it to the equity and human relations commission, you have to specify that you want to refer it to them. And then they would be better. They would be better. They send it to the commission. \nSPEAKER_19:  and then they would be better. \nSPEAKER_19:  you \nSPEAKER_30:  It's up to you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm fine with staff with the city staff considering whether or not it's appropriate. And you know what if the staff \nSPEAKER_19:  And you know what if the staff comes back to us and says they would like it to go to the commission? We can always do that in the June meeting. \nSPEAKER_19:  So let's ask the question staff to staff first and then if they think that it should go to their full commission. \nSPEAKER_19:  then we can do that based on that. And actually, let's put that in. \nSPEAKER_19:  the motion so that we don't have to wait. So the motion would be recommended to staff for staff to determine if they can do an analysis or if it should be referred to the full. \nSPEAKER_19:  Equity Commission. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  how we recover all the bases. \nSPEAKER_19:  Is there a second now? \nSPEAKER_30:  Can I just try and really fast? I just want to make sure everyone's aware that just based on the cadence of that the equity human relations commission. \nSPEAKER_30:  and when they can agenda is \nSPEAKER_30:  I \nSPEAKER_19:  I know that's why I want it to go to staff first and if staff thinks that they can get it done. \nSPEAKER_30:  that's why I want to \nSPEAKER_19:  But if they think that you go to the full commission, then we're going to be \nSPEAKER_19:  longer period out. Got it. Yeah, I'm aware of that. Thank you, April though. \nSPEAKER_19:  for a second. \nSPEAKER_19:  Oh, I did. Commissioner deep in a deck to second it. Do I need to ask for more public comment? \nSPEAKER_19:  Taylor. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, you're good. \nSPEAKER_19:  I'm good. Okay. So then can we call the vote please? \nSPEAKER_04:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_19:  I thank everyone again and I will be seeing you down the road for more dialogue. \nSPEAKER_19:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_19:  So the next item. \nSPEAKER_19:  I'm going to recommend that we continue item 4 to the June"

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  providing an update for the City of Long Beach Public Records Act program April. \nSPEAKER_00:  JT, do you want to just advance slides for me? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. Eric, can you pull up the PowerPoint? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so I think they're getting the clicker, so we can just put a couple of second pause on this and I'll get right into it. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, perfect. So we'll just go. So in April, I brought together, I brought forward an overview of the Public Records Act program for the City of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  There have been challenges then in the past and now due to a number of reasons. But this presentation today does review much of what we already discussed as grounding in what the program is, but also providing updates on progress and new initiatives since April. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I appreciate the chair and the vice chair allowing us to spend some time cleaning up the program and really dedicating resources to getting items closed out and then coming back to you now. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the overview today is includes challenges, dedicated resources, new efforts, initiatives, and progress made. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this is just another review of what the Public Records Act is. We've already presented this. It's in the presentation that was provided to you yesterday. You can ask any questions on this at the end, but I'm just going to. \nSPEAKER_00:  advance. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as was previously noted, challenges included COVID-19, staff vacancies, it's not a surprise, especially if you've been paying attention to budget discussions that we have, we still have significant vacancies within the city. The workloads and capacity have not changed. And so therefore with the vacancies, the workload and capacity continues to remain very high. And just as we still emerge from COVID, vacancies, homeless emergency staff have been feeling burnout and the overwhelming nature requests. \nSPEAKER_00:  contribute to that. \nSPEAKER_00:  So dedicated resources, we with the fiscal year 24 budget, as we've communicated, proposed the office of ethics and transparency so that we can bring together our Public Records Act program and our ethics commission and program under one umbrella. As I've communicated prior, this doesn't mean that any of the duties change. Heather and the team still work on what they're working on. Our peer 18 still works on what they're working on. But now there's a dedicated focus and just general ability to communicate that this is, this together is what we're doing to promote ethics and transparency for the city through the city manager's office. So in addition to myself, we have an assistant administrative analyst and a clerk type of three prior that was a temporary position, but through the support of the city manager as well as the ethics commission, we were able to structure the state of the city. And I believe our staff member, Sam, came on board around April and she's just been knocking things out of the park. So it's made a noticeable difference into tackling a lot of the old items and also \nSPEAKER_00:  incoming as we know we have city attorney team and then we have the police department I always like to note has their own separate team they have a couple of other related bills that require them to adhere to record disclosures and then citywide we have almost 50 liaisons these are not just 50 staff who are working on these a staff go beyond that but we have 50 liaisons who are basically what we would consider our SMEs subject matter experts or super users \nSPEAKER_00:  So new efforts and initiatives since we last presented. So we have met with every department's management team for a peer-a refresher. So myself, along with either Atoi or Anita, in the City Attorney's Office, have provided presentations to every department's management team. Because when we were working with the liaison, we realized that as much as they were really working hard and dedicated to closing out and addressing the peer-aids, it was really, they really needed the support of their leadership. So we started from the top. Dawn met with the City Manager's executive team, including all department heads. And then we did what we call a roadshow. We provide one-on-one virtual trainings with staff new to the GUABQA system and lieu of just sending them training materials and resources. So before, we only had one admin staff supporting this, they would just send them the existing materials and resources that we have. But now that we had an additional admin member, she's able to actually dedicate one-on-one virtual trainings with them, which I really do think makes a difference, especially if you're new to the GUABQA system as a user and a prover. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have established standing monthly meetings with the mayor and council offices to discuss their pending PRAs, address any questions or obstacles and provide support. We found that sometimes people just interpret things the way they're not meant to be interpreted and when we help them it actually simplifies a process that they seem to be over complicating. And so we're meeting with them monthly to walk through all of the outstanding PRAs that they have so that we can help them get them closed and gather documents. We're using new digital tools to create training materials. There is a tool called scribe that actually is better than Canva for training materials. So we started using that so that we can kind of bring together a more cohesive training program. We are working with department liaisons on individual tailored approaches. Everyone has different challenges. They have different operations, nuances. So we're working with them one on one to make sure we can address their individual needs, which again helps break down the complicated nuances and get them to where they need to be. And that just goes into revamping the training approach. And now we're working on many training guides to address the common questions that pop up over time from both staff and that staff when they're working on their teams and also when they're working in the GovQA system. \nSPEAKER_00:  progress made. So as of May we had 190 open PR requests that were considered 60 plus days old and 98 of them have since been closed. That's a big deal because as I mentioned before, some of these, you know, I just reviewed a batch that was only one attachment of several that needed to be closed out for a particular request and that particular item was over 300 pages of emails. So getting 98, 60 plus day, PRAs closed since May is a big accomplishment for our team. So on average, between May and August of this year, we received about 375 requests a month and we worked to close out about 343 requests per month. This compared to the same time period in 2022, the average received per month of 346 and the average closeout per month was 296. So our closeout rate has increased by about 6%. It's not a ton, but it shows improvement and it shows that the things that we are implementing are starting to show success. We'll take the small ones because it just builds over time. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that's it for me. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Come here, shot well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Great report. Really appreciate it. And I'd like the development of creating the Office of Ethics and Transparency. And I think that's going to create a lot of even more opportunities just to kind of... \nSPEAKER_06:  kind of help support both sides helping to support each other. I may have missed it, but in total then, what will be the size of the office? It's the first question. \nSPEAKER_00:  five FTEs. \nSPEAKER_06:  five fts and then the deputy city manager is over that office that's your role is it okay and that's and your role is focused just on that office \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, I have other projects and programs, but this is the core of my oversight, just like we have the Office of Climate Assessingability, and we have the Office of Equity. We create offices so that we can put the emphasis in the focus, and they're not just programs that are nice to have, like they are core programs and offices to the entire structure of our organization. So that was really the driver to creating this team, a cohesive approach that \nSPEAKER_00:  really showed the value of the mayor and council by approving it via the budget and our city manager too. \nSPEAKER_06:  So like the diversity and inclusion, I'm not getting the name right, that is a separate office. Okay, and but you oversee that office too. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that's another deputy. Thank you. That's all I want to go. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. That's what I want to come from. And I also very much appreciate your focus on targeted training for particular areas because everyone has a unique issues and that really helps to make sure that we are \nSPEAKER_06:  able to provide the records in a timely manner. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yep, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Before you go any further, I forgot to ask for a motion to receive a file that report. Somebody want to make the motion. And- \nSPEAKER_06:  Seconded. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does anyone else have any questions for April? \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  \ub0a0\uc528\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  following up on Commissioner Shotwell's questions. Are the people \nSPEAKER_03:  like the two that are listed under your position, the Assistant Administrative Analyst and the Clerk Type of Three. \nSPEAKER_03:  those people are only working on ethics. \nSPEAKER_03:  thing. \nSPEAKER_00:  pure thing to me. \nSPEAKER_00:  PRA. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think this is related to PRA. So no, to answer your question, they are PRA focus. They always have been. The clerk type is three is an addition. The intention is that hopefully over time as we close out the backlog, their capacity is freed up to support Heather in an administrative function, to track training progress, and that sort of thing. Right now, we talked about this. We're gonna give them time to focus on getting through the backlog of the PRAs, and then hopefully they can be as close to a 50-50 split between the PRA program and the ethics team. \nSPEAKER_00:  and it's heavily included. \nSPEAKER_03:  Heather's time going towards PRA. \nSPEAKER_00:  No, we might tap into Heather's expertise in the learn platform so that as we want to get trainings up into where code of conduct trainings live, but that shouldn't take much time. It's more guidance and pointing us in the right direction. But Heather is \nSPEAKER_00:  doing what she's been doing since she came up work. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I'm glad to see the extra resources being assigned to this. I think it's really important. So thank you to everybody that made that happen because I know it didn't just happen. \nSPEAKER_00:  made that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you have an idea? \nSPEAKER_03:  when you get caught up. \nSPEAKER_03:  and there \nSPEAKER_03:  that there won't be, there will only be a handful of requests that haven't been \nSPEAKER_03:  other than the ones that have just come in that have been written. \nSPEAKER_00:  That happens to people getting \nSPEAKER_00:  responded to. So what I'm hearing is more or less more mostly caught up with the 60 plus state PRAs because the ones that come in are going to need time to to \nSPEAKER_00:  be addressed. \nSPEAKER_00:  We don't have a sense of time quite yet. We need, we're still working on addressing the old ones with the department heads and I do want to acknowledge the fact that Dawn and her team are becoming more involved in that with them. And I think that's important because we can advise them and train them on how it works, what it is, how you redact, is that a responsible document. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can we find something that achieves the goal of responding to this request in a more efficient way? But when we do have the lingering challenges, sometimes we need to get the city attorney's office to walk through it with those departments as well to highlight what they need to just put a little fire around. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  But we're trying to get them to do. So I'm hoping to come back in the new year with an update that we can address. You know, here's what we consider as outstanding. And here's where anticipating those items are closed out. But it's a revolving door, you know, next next month, a period that was only 45 days old is now 60 plus. So it's just ever changing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you keep track of whether or not the initial response that I think is supposed to be made within 10 days is made within 10 days? Yes. Okay. I think the next time that we have one of these reports that would be a useful. \nSPEAKER_03:  number two. \nSPEAKER_03:  to know. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if you could add that, I think it would be helpful. And also if you, like you, right at the end there, you gave us some comparative numbers to last year. I didn't quite get them, but I wish they were here. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  I could see them and I don't think they are. You just say. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I don't think. \nSPEAKER_03:  made it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, that's right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, that's presentation that was sent out. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, I added that. I added that. So we made the slime back up. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  million that sent me my \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  My team member was out, so I thought let me just send the PowerPoint and then I'll add it. So this PowerPoint, the most up-to-date one is on LedgerStar. I'm if you want to go back after the fact, but we'll get the PowerPoint back up so we can show you. Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  But it basically shows a 5% increase in monthly close outs, 5% or 6% and monthly close up since last year. So here we go. So we would. \nSPEAKER_00:  The 2022 closeout rate monthly. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  with \nSPEAKER_00:  Those. \nSPEAKER_00:  P.R.E.'s receipt versus closed out was approximately 85.5%. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then compared to this year that the same time frame is a 91.2% close at rate of the ones received so \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, that's what I didn't have and what I downloaded was what we were sent separately. I think so. Anyway, thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Last question I have is do these numbers include the requests that are being handled by the police department in there? \nSPEAKER_03:  unit. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  No, that's the whole, that's a separate team. So this is just citywide. This is not include the police department. But in the near, I'm happy to work with them to do a joint presentation on their \nSPEAKER_00:  their metrics as well as hours. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so when do you suggest we have \nSPEAKER_03:  Have you back on this issue? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  January? Okay, yeah. It might be hard, you know, we're hitting the holidays. So things might slow in terms of responsiveness. I mean, we're still going to respond within the legal requirements, but in terms of uploading documents and closing them out, we might see a little bit of a delay as staff quand vacation should be too much, but I think February is a good time to bring staff together to do another review. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so you think maybe overall this should be a twice a year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, for it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll be happy to do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll be happy to do that. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, that's great. All right, thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks, Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  On the chart, you say 190 of the original 190 that were open, 98 are now closed. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh-huh. \nSPEAKER_02:  of the requests that have been filed since May, the May through August numbers. Are any of those now over 60 days old? \nSPEAKER_00:  It could be and that's why I think when we were talking about this originally and we're getting into the data it's very hard. \nSPEAKER_00:  It's very hard to say because it's a fluid. So something that was not 60 days old yesterday is 60 days old tomorrow. And so it's hard to really dig in, which is why when we are going into data, the best way to communicate the information was by average of per month. So, yes, so there probably are some that were opened in May that are now 60 days old, same thing with June. \nSPEAKER_00:  So if you want us to get into it by month. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can do that. Like there was 30 received in May. \nSPEAKER_00:  of that time 60 were 60 plus days old. \nSPEAKER_00:  But it's hard because if I go into June and start saying that, well, I can tell you that. \nSPEAKER_00:  20 of the 60 plus day items were. \nSPEAKER_00:  closed out, but those could have been from prior to May, so the way it works is not always very clear. So we can talk about it in a chair and vice-chair meeting, and I can kind of show you the challenges with the data being so fluid. But as I was trying to dig into how we can best present the data, I was kind of hitting roadblocks. I mean, what we could do is we can get to one month, and we'd probably have like, \nSPEAKER_00:  three sides of data, but it's just... \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I would like more data. So on any day. \nSPEAKER_02:  Whatever day it is September 1, you go into the system. \nSPEAKER_02:  you can say to the system. \nSPEAKER_02:  show me all of the PRAs that are over 60 days old as of right today. Yes, okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  and if they're over. \nSPEAKER_02:  However, many days between May 1 and September 1, you know they pre-existed the May. \nSPEAKER_02:  day, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. Because you'll get a report that says we have 20 that are. \nSPEAKER_02:  120 days old. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have ten that are \nSPEAKER_02:  75, right? And you, is that a report that you're already getting? \nSPEAKER_02:  We can, yeah, we can slice the data that way. Okay. And can you also slice the data? Do you slice the data by department? Yes. Okay. So the way that you manage the overage PRA requests is you contact a particular department and say you have 10 that are over 120 days old. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so what do you have? \nSPEAKER_02:  What do you have? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  20 that are \nSPEAKER_00:  what we do is we send \nSPEAKER_02:  What we \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  who we were sending them monthly so we would send each department their monthly reports over 60 plus days old. It actually has all the data there. It shows it when it was open, who the requester was, what the requester is, how many days passed due. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, it is or how many days since we received it. So we don't say you have 10 that are 60 and 15 that are 75. We say here's your list, you see all the information and you can see how far back it goes. We are also doing the same thing which I didn't know in my presentation. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the department had briefing. So our city manager and assistant city manager brief with department heads at least monthly. Some of them, the larger departments are by monthly. So twice a month. And so every Friday, our team members send me the report. Here's all the department briefings we have coming up next week. And I go and put it in the CM and the ACM notes so that they know. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Public Works has to, parks has zero, you know. And so we have a couple of mechanisms to remind departments that they have end-to-perman heads that they have 60 plus day old periods. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I'm recognizing that the date is only good on the day that it's grabbed off the system. I would like to see as of a date. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you give it to us by department? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, over, you know, whether it's the number that they have over 60 days, if it's, if the report, if the data can spew out without a whole lot of manual labor, I'd like to know, you know, this department has 10 that are over 60 and five that are over 90, four that are over 120. I assume, you know, you've got 92 from the original 190 and right now those are probably, oh, well, they are well over six months old. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bien. \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, some of them can be 61 days old. This is a 60 plus day report. \nSPEAKER_02:  No, no, I'm looking at the PowerPoint that was presented, the original 190 that were open, 98 of those are now closed, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Was that the original 990 or? If totally. \nSPEAKER_00:  it's totally. I guess it should read where as there were 190 open-perre requests that were 60 plus days old in May, there are only 98. \nSPEAKER_00:  that are, well actually no, I think it, so there's two ways we can read it. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  have\ud558\uba74\uc11c we \nSPEAKER_00:  We can I would say yes of the 190 there are still 98 that's correct \nSPEAKER_02:  And there may be more because of the may time, because of the additional may time. \nSPEAKER_02:  In other words, if you take 190 subtract 98 that leads to 92. Do you have only 92? \nSPEAKER_02:  total PRA requests that are more than 60 days old right now or is that just from the original? \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe that it's just from the original, from the them and me. Yep. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, so it would be good to have some... \nSPEAKER_02:  more information on aging by department, how many are open and over 60 days old on the date you prepare the slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  for OK, more than 3,000 more. The City has declined on Sunday for January. 724. Thank you. All rightVi try Monsieur Michele Kita, we're sure you're just ahead of him, so not \u2013 visibility. Gillian said it's nothing gained info for COVID. This is what we miss however as we're trying to avoidnicere enough. Or not, cookieeremay and any criminals to go back to our website, goodbye. Bye, everyone. We're so sorry that we are Landitland. I'm happy for the \nSPEAKER_00:  over end of January. \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, we'll talk more about it because I feel like \nSPEAKER_00:  I want to know what the goal of communicating this information is. Is it just so you have information? Is, you know, what is the goal of the data so that we know exactly how to pull it and how to tell the story? \nSPEAKER_04:  The goal is to give us reassurance that the number of outstanding PRAs are going, that are aging are going down. So to go to the vice chair's point, okay, there's roughly 92 that were open in May that are now still more than 60. But you've given us no information between May and September. How many that were not on that are now more than 60 days old. So really what we want to see is that that 60 day number is going away because the departments are closing them out more rapidly. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so I will just say in confidence that that 60 plus number will never go away. It won't ever go away because of the nature of some of the pierees that we receive. I mean, there's some pierees that they want the plans and the details for every major arterial street down to the AutoCAD files. That is going to be a multi-year piere to close it out. We are focused on making sure that we're legally compliant, which is that we are making significant or meaningful progress to providing those documents. So, whereas yes, we want them to be lower in nature. I just want to caveat that we're not going to see a day where we only have five, 60 plus day pierees. And that's why when we initially presented, there was, it's just very nuanced. So, you know, we have an item that's open six months, but we have ten, you know, assignments, which means all council mayor and maybe two departments that are uploading hundreds and hundreds of pages of \nSPEAKER_00:  It depends on the nature of the request. A community hospital or a Queen Mary is going to be more robust. I want to have a conversation related to what's the nature of the PRAs that are still open. There are multiple activities. We have ten activities associated with one PRA. All of them, but two have been closed. The request, even though it's 60, 90, 120, 90% of the documents related to their request. The other two activities probably are going to provide the same documents because they're all the same emails and the same people on it. But in order to comply with the law, those two offices still have to close theirs out. I do want to talk about the nature of these more robust periods are still open because I think it's valid to show that it's not that we're just sitting on it. There is a lot of staff time going into gathering historical documents or more robust data. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think dividing it by department will help us get to that. So we'll understand is it. \nSPEAKER_02:  aging because we still have a cultural problem or is it aging because of the nature of the request. So at some point you'll be able to get down to a point where a particular department can say, you know, my remaining aged requests are \nSPEAKER_02:  of a nature that they're going to require substantially more time. \nSPEAKER_02:  to complete. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think it's not as cut and dry as that. I think I could say it's both. I can say this department has both the nature and the culture at play here. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, and then we can have a critical staff member leave that was our number one on the Queen Mary for two years, and now we are scrambling to try to figure it out. So there's a story to tell around a lot of these, but I will acknowledge that there is just us still working through the cultural issues and the staffing challenges that surround what should be closed out easily. I mean, I can go into request and I can say 99% of the time, that should probably not take more than 20 days, and then there are sometimes a look at that, I'm like, this is going to be a really, really long one. So I appreciate that the Chair mentions that what is the compliance and assurance that we're making progress, but I also want to note that it's not all the stories on entirely told in the data that's provided, and then you have to really dig into the types of requests that we receive, and send departments might receive one huge request, and it takes them forever, and then all the other ones that get are small. So it just varies, it's not going to be, it could be a cultural and a nature, but it's just a lot of different factors, and just for my experience in seeing all these. \nSPEAKER_04:  And where a requester is asking for a plethora of information, we've gotten the culture acclimated to actually contacting the person, making the request so that we can understand what it is that they're asking for, what the end goal is so that we can kind of guide them to this information is what you need, not all of the street maps. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so I appreciate you asking that question because when we're doing our one-on-one trainings with the staff, the departments to work through their backlog as well as with mayor and council offices, that's the goal. It's like that's not what they're asking for. If you give them this, that will satisfy their requirement. And the other thing is like you don't get to have your department head sign off on purays that are deemed disposable by a city attorney or myself in some cases. You have to release it. So getting them to understand like \nSPEAKER_00:  the nuances and cut through and make things more efficient is also something we're working toward. And I think we're making progress, but I do believe the one on one and the more tailored approach is helping with that. \nSPEAKER_04:  So will agenda is for our next agenda setting meeting so that \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to share a North Median question. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I just have a quick question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry, Jared. \nSPEAKER_05:  April, thank you. Out of curiosity, when a PRA is received, \nSPEAKER_05:  Does it? \nSPEAKER_05:  Do you prioritize it based on the nature of the request? \nSPEAKER_05:  For example, there was a traffic accident at Pine and Ocean. I need records on the signals and the engineer. \nSPEAKER_05:  versus, oh my cat got stuck on a tree and I don't know if it's the city or the county line. Do you prioritize it when they come in or you handle it the day comes in or within those 10 days? \nSPEAKER_00:  We handle it within those 10 days generally speaking, although I will say that I get flagged on, that I'll send to the department and say, make sure you address this within the next week because I know what they're asking for can be handled in a day or two. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and do you prioritize? \nSPEAKER_05:  based on who sent in the request for resident versus an attorney representing. \nSPEAKER_05:  a plaintiff or defendant. \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  If it gets elevated to like for example the city attorney's office is working on something because they're representing the city. Okay. Then yes, absolutely we will look into that but just generally speaking if someone says you know I want. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Code enforcement went to a building flood. I want their reports. We treat them in its an attorney's office. We'll treat that like we do anyone asking for a permit for a past permit because they moved into a new house and they want to know if a permit got pulled for electrical. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  One follow-up question. If it's going to exceed the 10 days or it's a by-product period of time, do you provide an update or letter to the per-questor? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, so that's one of the main, that was one of the main focus items that we were paying attention to around the April, May timeframe was let's just get into the habit at the very least you're responding within 10 calendar days and if you're not. \nSPEAKER_00:  You're asking for an extension before those 10 calendar days are up. And so I hope that we've kind of built that into it. And now it's addressing the speed of being the documents. But yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Any other questions for April? \nSPEAKER_04:  any comments from the public on this item? \nSPEAKER_04:  If you just come to the podium. \nSPEAKER_04:  and state, at least your first name for the record please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. How much time do I have? \nSPEAKER_04:  about three minutes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. I'm Laura Selmer. I'm a resident of District 4. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you commissioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  And thank you city staff. I appreciate the presentation a lot. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm here today because of a public request that's being denied. \nSPEAKER_01:  I didn't make the request. I'm just a party informed on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I'm wondering if there could be any, if there's any discussion about having any kind of arbitration. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't mean \nSPEAKER_01:  I just mean when there's a disagreement on why. \nSPEAKER_01:  why the records are being... \nSPEAKER_01:  withheld. \nSPEAKER_01:  and where they seem flawed. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the person might want to go. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know \nSPEAKER_01:  and have a bigger discussion, have some kind of a hearing or arbitration over that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Because right now it seems the only recourse. \nSPEAKER_01:  I remember the public has is to \nSPEAKER_01:  Get an attorney. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vila Lossu, very expensive for an individual. \nSPEAKER_01:  and also for the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it could easily be, I think, \nSPEAKER_01:  In the case that I'm bringing before you, it's \nSPEAKER_01:  an individual who's requesting records about euthanized animals at the shelter. \nSPEAKER_01:  And Joe. \nSPEAKER_01:  though all those records are being denied to the person. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I think it makes a lot of sense, this individual wants records because the shelter is claiming that it doesn't euthanize. \nSPEAKER_01:  healthy animals. \nSPEAKER_01:  but the public doesn't have any way to verify that. \nSPEAKER_01:  until they can look at some of the records and see. \nSPEAKER_01:  why animals have been euthanized. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that historically been something in place, that in animal welfare. \nSPEAKER_01:  people have been doing across the country. It's really just looking and seeing why the animals are euthanized. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, was it a minor? Did they have a cold? \nSPEAKER_01:  or what. And so that kind of transparency and disclosure is essential to some people who are looking at a very progressive shelter, but they just want to do their homework and check the records. \nSPEAKER_01:  others. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  records are now being denied to any member of the public who seeks them. \nSPEAKER_01:  but \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, another reason here is... \nSPEAKER_01:  that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Our veterinarians are buried at Long Beach Animal Care Services. \nSPEAKER_01:  five years ago they asked to add more staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  So they're very overworked. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, and if \nSPEAKER_01:  If they're not comfortable, believe it, we say. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  revealing the record. \nSPEAKER_01:  Then I think we have a bigger problem that we really need to staff up and support our veterinarians. \nSPEAKER_01:  but give them also a notice that \nSPEAKER_01:  Some of the work they do is public work. \nSPEAKER_01:  and there needs some members of the community want to see what's going on. Thank you very much. I'm Laura Selmer. \nSPEAKER_04:  for your comments. We'll take those under consideration at a future meeting. Any, can we call the vote on this item please? \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you make sure to know that? \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Divina Dictus. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can you make sure you're shot well? \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_00:  I.

Just wanted to let you know that we are moving forward with a June launch of the training and help line. So very excited about that. I did attend the ECI impact conference last week. That was very valuable as well. And then wanted to circle back on the city clerk's response to the commission's request about going back to the minutes of March and collecting more information and then moving forward collecting more information. The clerk is not going to be doing that just to keep it consistent with council and other commissions that they support. They're a small but mighty team. So just don't have that capacity to do that for everybody. And they're also transitioning to a new legislative management system for the agenda's minutes videos. So that software will have a feature that will create transcripts for each meeting and those transcripts will be searchable.

We already had the report from the lobbying committee. So it's the report of the \nSPEAKER_00:  The vendor code is \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Shaw, we're going to give that one. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll provide the report especially since I think I was solely responsible for it. I told you don't throw yourself on the sword. Well, solely responsible for the delay of the item. But we have the Commissioner Day Bendidictus and I have met with staff at a few occasions along with so both Heather, Julian and also Taylor. Based on the prior feedback of the Commission and the Commission's review, staff had pulled together all the comments. In addition, we had benefit of the benchmarking that had been done of other industry and government codes. And they put together a draft that reflected our input out of the two or three sessions that we had with staff. Both Commissioner Day Bendidictus and I were comfortable with that approach. We'd like the approach that staff had done. They really used an opportunity to increase the readability of the document. It's a lot shorter, more concise. It's all focused on basically our values based and very aspirational with reliance on the contractual terms and conditions where we need things to be a little bit more specific and not delivering the vendor code of conduct with that. So we will have the, I believe we'll be able to send it out shortly after this meeting to the full commission for the full commission's review. So we're looking forward to your additional review and input. We do anticipate that then both the ethics office of Heather, along with our vendor management team within the city, we'll be able to then work together and kind of jointly own the vendor code of conduct. And once we get to a point where one will be getting soliciting feedback from other departments within the city and then also promoting it once we've actually had adopted. We do, as part of this ad hoc, have also, and this has been things that we've discussed at prior meetings, feel that there's going to be the need for city, in some cases, city wide policies on certain types of activities. For example, gifts, meals in entertainment, gratuities, conflicts of interest, use of assets, anti retaliation, anti corruption. And these are where we're going to want to recommend that the commission consider further ad hoc to actually address those individually or collectively, but doing it in a way that we can actually get them adopted as resolutions, I think it's resolutions within the city so that they have city wide applicability and we're not having dependent on individual departments within the city having their own policies and points. And with that, I'll turn it over to Commissioner David and Indictus, anything to add? \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, and welcome back. \nSPEAKER_00:  Any questions for the work group? \nSPEAKER_00:  Any public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_00:  Seeing none, can I have a motion to receive and file the report? \nSPEAKER_00:  been moved by Commissioner Dibandia Dictus, seconded by Commissioner Fee.
