I'm Larry Rich. I'm the sustainability coordinator for the office of sustainability which administers the Sustainable City Commission and our item here today is to give you an overview of our annual work plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  So our enacting ordinance that created the commission calls for a annual work plan to be approved by the City Council. And so, pursuant to that each year in September, we hold an offsite retreat with our commission to kind of go over a work plan that they approved at their last meeting in October and it's coming to City Council perhaps on December 7th for City Council approval. And while it's usually approved on consent, today's meeting with the committee gives an opportunity to quickly go over some details. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  There we go. So our \nSPEAKER_03:  Sustainable City Action Plan and our work plan revolve around these seven focus areas. And so all of our actions have to do with these things. Like buildings and neighborhoods, climate, energy and climate, urban nature, green economy, waste reduction. \nSPEAKER_03:  water and so on. And next slide please. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we divide up our work plan into a series of program management projects so there's nine of them and I'll go over each one of them real quickly. Our lead off one is an ongoing effort to develop a direct install program for disadvantaged communities that reduce greenhouse gases. We are putting the final touches on a proposal to do a re-roofing program to enable low income households to get solar through a partner organization that they need a new roof first. So we're focusing in on \nSPEAKER_03:  roof replacement with a type of roofing product called a cool roof that already the nature of a cool roof a reduces greenhouse gas. \nSPEAKER_03:  potential greenhouse gases in that home but by putting a roof on the particular home that has been pre-approved for solar through a different program will help them to get solar as well. So we're hoping to come out with an R.K. on this in the next couple of months. Next is our green business recognition program, which is our ongoing program to do certification of long beach businesses as green where they work through a checklist and get technical assistance from our staff and also access to rebates. And this year we're putting a special effort and expanded outreach to support BIPOC-owned and disadvantaged businesses through partnerships with community-based organizations. And then we have a number of city department partners including the water department and environmental services bureau, economic development, etc. \nSPEAKER_03:  Our next one is \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, we're playing a role in the \nSPEAKER_03:  to implement implementation of the climate action adaptation plan, which is in its final stages before it comes to City Council, hopefully early next year for adoption. And so the office of sustainability is identified in a number of the actions in there for implementation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_03:  Urban agriculture initiatives in particular are urban agriculture incentive zone program where property owners of vacant lots can get a property tax reduction if they allow a urban agriculture use to occupy their property for a period of five years we have two of those \nSPEAKER_03:  incentives current and we're actually just received another one the other day we'll be working that one through. \nSPEAKER_03:  In addition to this, we're going to be working on a microgram program to support urban ag that hopefully can dovetail with our UAIZ program. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next is our watershed and urban forestry initiatives is has to do with tree planting but also paying attention to storm water infiltration projects so things like bioswales and bio retention tree wells and kind of merging those things together to help improve the health of the urban forest through increased infiltration of stormwater. So we work with public works on this and then also the conservation core of Long Beach that has some funding available to do additional tree planting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next is electric vehicle initiatives particularly around charging infrastructure. We have a giveaway program for level two chargers that residents can apply for if they pull a electrical permit to have them installed at their home. We're also working on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well our main effort is with a technical assistance grant with scag to develop a electric vehicle charging infrastructure plan that has a focus on multi-family dwellings and workplace charging but then public works is also involved in a blueprint for medium duty zero mission vehicles that were playing a role in as well next please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  next. \nSPEAKER_03:  lead for cities so lead is a green building rating system that has expanded to be able to. Rates cities as well and so we're part of a nationwide cohort to bring long beach through that certification process and so some time next year we should be submitting for a lead rating for lead for cities and then next is our street sustainability strategic plan. So this is meant to replace our \nSPEAKER_03:  more than 10-year-old Sustainable City Action Plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we're working through some \nSPEAKER_03:  public outreach efforts and internal gap analysis efforts to be able to bring that forward later this year or late sometime next year and have it you know be well integrated ideally with the cap during its implementation phase and other city strategic planning efforts. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then finally, contributing work on implementation of the framework for reconciliation, especially through youth workforce programs. So there's a big opportunity here with an item that will be coming to this committee later on the recently introduced youth climate core concept. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we'll be participating in that and doing all we can to plug that into, you know, the things that we do initiatives that we have in the office of sustainability and things to implement both the framework for reconciliation \nSPEAKER_03:  our own strategic plan and the climate action adaptation plan. Next please. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in addition to our program management, \nSPEAKER_03:  Project. \nSPEAKER_03:  Program Management Projects. We have a variety of field work programs where we currently \nSPEAKER_03:  uh, work with workforce development and conservation core of Long Beach to implement these urban greening activities around the city. So they include our multidilivery and pickup program, which makes free mult available at Willow Springs, but then people can also sign up for free delivery. Our tree planting program, which has been ongoing where residents can request a parkway tree in front of their house that will come out and plant, but also our fruit trees and front yards program. \nSPEAKER_03:  Our compost program has morphed into hosting and supporting an organization called the Long Beach Community Compost that has a site at Willow Springs where \nSPEAKER_03:  people bring their \nSPEAKER_03:  Kitchen scraps and turn it into compost and then people that are part of that network are able to take away finished compost but also will be working with the environmental services bureau to try to locate a master composting training program at Willis Springs as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  next place. \nSPEAKER_03:  We try to encourage edible landscapes, you know, for food production and, you know, local food networks. Our big push on that front is establishing a community orchard of Willow Springs Park in the same vicinity that the Long Beach Community Compost is operating and then continuing to provide edible garden workshops that have been online that we hope to reintroduce in-person workshops both at Willow Springs and perhaps at libraries as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then finally, Willis Springs Park's support in our native plant nursery. We have a variety of volunteer and workshop programs at Willis Springs that just has lots of potential to continue to expand and get more public activation of different areas of the park and engagement with youth and others. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  by expanding the restoration area and introducing \nSPEAKER_03:  you know \nSPEAKER_03:  pollinator plants and even public art opportunities. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then our last item on here is our annual special event where we partner with and the health department public works in walk long beach to host a nine mile urban hike connecting ranchalos serritos to ranchalos alamedos or vice versa we we shift directions every time going over the top of signal hill which we have that event in September. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  So those are all of the activities that the staff of the Office of Sustainability are working on, you know, many of them are ongoing. So we've been working on these. We'll continue them on in 2022. \nSPEAKER_03:  These are the list of topics that we organize for our commission. Our commission has nine meetings a year taking a couple of months off and then having that off-site retreat in September. And so on the left column are reoccurring topics and updates that we get from community partners like \nSPEAKER_03:  The aquarium and CSU will be in Long Beach transit, but also other city departments like the poor and public works. But then on the right are more one time requests by our commission on special topics that they want to hear about. \nSPEAKER_03:  and this first one, Surf is actually meant to be on our agenda next month. \nSPEAKER_03:  but other ones we hope to get updates on are like the Green Airport Plan. \nSPEAKER_03:  and stuff around oil operations and, you know, oil tax and equity considerations are some of the recent requests of our commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that's it. That's a quick overview. You know, our work plan is four pages. You just saw the, the, just of it and you'll, you'll see it come through council on December 7th for your approval. And I'm happy to answer any questions. You may have about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  them. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  before we get into \nSPEAKER_04:  comments or a public discussion can I get a motion please? \nSPEAKER_04:  moved. \nSPEAKER_04:  in second. So, um, \nSPEAKER_04:  So I am well first of all, thank you so much for that presentation Larry and I just have a few comments to start. I want to first say just thank you for the tour of Willis Springs Park that you and the chair will are provided. I really didn't know what to expect when I went there and I was just amazed. \nSPEAKER_04:  how much you've accomplished there. \nSPEAKER_04:  and also just the potential. \nSPEAKER_04:  for future transformation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I wanted to ask you, can you go a little bit more in detail? \nSPEAKER_04:  on the disadvantaged community, the GHC reduction program. \nSPEAKER_04:  What does this involve? \nSPEAKER_03:  So this is using AB 32 funding which is comes down from the state specifically to reduce greenhouse gases and this is a component of that funding that is meant to benefit directly disadvantaged community census tracks. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so for a while there we were looking at a direct install energy efficiency program that would allow participants to get energy efficiency upgrades, you know, insulation and other things to their homes. But then we through our due diligence found out that there is an existing program out there that people can already take advantage of through the Long Beach Community Action Partnership. So we didn't want to duplicate that even those ours would have been slightly different. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we \nSPEAKER_03:  found this other opportunity that relates to the organization grid alternatives that is very active and long beach, put installing free rooftop solar on qualifying households. \nSPEAKER_03:  and they have a number of households that they have pre-qualified. \nSPEAKER_03:  but they can't move forward with the solar project because they need roof repair or new roof, which their funding does not provide for. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we're in the final phases of \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  making sure that a cool roof program would qualify for AB 32 funding and there seems to be president out in the rest of California where other jurisdictions have used it for that purpose. And we are excited about the opportunity to increase the amount of solar on people's rooftops by giving them a cool roof which does a couple of things it cools the house down so that they potentially potentially \nSPEAKER_03:  will use less energy to begin with. \nSPEAKER_03:  But then we also understand that a light and cool roof basically means \nSPEAKER_03:  a light colored or close to white roof that reflects solar radiation. \nSPEAKER_03:  It actually some studies have revealed that it. \nSPEAKER_03:  increases the performance of solar panels because the roof is actually reflecting \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, more energy back towards the solar panels instead of absorbing it. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that's an exciting thing that we wouldn't be the first to do it, but there's not widespread programs. \nSPEAKER_03:  that you know other cities and we need to get there eventually have cool roof requirements that we do not at this time but this is an opportunity to help people get a new roof have a cooler home and \nSPEAKER_03:  participate in renewable energy. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, well, thank you for that. And also regarding the cap, I'm very excited that the office sustainability will be hosting a climate. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Hello? \nSPEAKER_04:  and that you'll be working closely with \nSPEAKER_04:  development services on implementation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Also, I know that Janine Pierce before departure contributed a significant amount of divide by nine funds. \nSPEAKER_04:  to the partners of the parks to promote the planning, a street trees and empty tree wells. \nSPEAKER_04:  I just wanted to know, are you working with them? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  when you plant parkway trees. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I'm familiar with that effort at the end of \nSPEAKER_03:  of former councilperson pierces, you know, I helped make suggestions towards that. Though, \nSPEAKER_03:  I haven't been recently in discussion with that. You know, so we get \nSPEAKER_03:  are requests directly from residents. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we work with the Public Works Department to make sure that the tree is approved. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I don't know if the funds that were raised through that effort are \nSPEAKER_03:  finding their own trees and they're going a different route or if they're actually \nSPEAKER_03:  But we're the ones that pay for the trees in our program. So I don't know. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you can help me get reconnected with that effort, we can see how we can help. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, good. So we'll, so yeah, I'll work on that and then we can. \nSPEAKER_04:  again connect and just see what we're at and what would that program. \nSPEAKER_04:  Also, I know that my amazing Chief of Staff has done the ranchals a walk every year and he speaks very highly of the work that you and your partners have done. \nSPEAKER_04:  at that event. So just want to say a special thank you Larry for your presentation and for all that you do. \nSPEAKER_04:  to support this sustainable city commission. And I just look forward to working with you. And now on so many. \nSPEAKER_04:  of the topics. We've got a lot of work to do. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we have identified as we move forward. So thank you. And then I'd like to just open it up to any other comments or questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you chairwoman I appreciate all that the committee's commissions doing and I'm constantly learning from everyone and I appreciate the discussions that we have outside of the committee meetings and I just want to thank you again for all that you're doing and specifically for your partnership with our staff. There's a lot that we need to continue to do as a city and it'll only get there if we all work together so thanks so much. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. And Madam Clerk, are there any public comments on this item? \nSPEAKER_01:  At this time, if there's any members of the public who wish to speak, please use the raised-hand functions. \nSPEAKER_01:  Our first speaker is Dave Schu-Ku. \nSPEAKER_01:  Dave, sugar, you can please begin. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hello? You hear me? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, very. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's her. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, first thing I noticed that Brian was wearing an SE t-shirt. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's the violation of AB 117. \nSPEAKER_00:  I may want to address that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I'd like to commissioners to ask. \nSPEAKER_00:  Larry Rich. \nSPEAKER_00:  What's going to happen if the CPUC decides on December 7th that they're going to allow Sunday, California Edison? \nSPEAKER_00:  to take away solar home. \nSPEAKER_00:  specifically the panels, the battery storage, and the net metering. \nSPEAKER_00:  uh... that \nSPEAKER_00:  solar homeowners in Long Beach were protesting SE headquarters on November 3rd. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Are there any more public comments? \nSPEAKER_01:  That concludes public comment for this item. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. Madam Clerk, can you please read item number three? \nSPEAKER_01:  Can we take a vote? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh yes, I'm sorry, yes, yes, we need to take a vote. \nSPEAKER_01:  first. No problem. \nSPEAKER_01:  Councilwoman Zinday has. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice your mongo. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here, Alan. \nSPEAKER_01:  I"

Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, now can you read item number three, please? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  Item 3 is a recommendation to receive and file a presentation on charge-ready program update. \nSPEAKER_06:  Perfect. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  And let's start with the staff report on this item. \nSPEAKER_07:  chair Allen this is Oscar Oscar or see so at a previous meeting of the city discuss its efforts at charge ready programs and at that time the committee expressed interest in and better understanding with Southern California Edison's requirements were and we have a have the pleasure here of \nSPEAKER_07:  hearing from Mr. Bustamante, Brian Bustamante with Southern California Edison, and he is here today to give you a representation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Hello everyone, thank you for having me. \nSPEAKER_02:  first day. \nSPEAKER_02:  was not aware of and I'm not familiar with the AB 117 but I took the shirt off so I apologize for. \nSPEAKER_02:  that inconvenience. So the charge ready program. So the charge ready program is a program that the utility funds it's a $432 million program for EV charging infrastructure throughout the service territory. This is a \nSPEAKER_02:  program aimed at getting about 38,000 charging stations out into the field across the service territory. It was just launched July of this year, but it is a five year program. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So there are actually three different specific components of the charge ready program. And I'm going to go into each of them in a little bit of detail and each slide will kind of build upon the next. But essentially the first offering is charging infrastructure and rebates for just really any of those. \nSPEAKER_02:  sites out in the field where we would potentially come out there and \nSPEAKER_02:  build out the infrastructure to a make ready position so what that means to you as a customers is all the infrastructure up until that step up and then the responsibility of the the actual charging station unit and beyond would be the responsibility of the customer in this particular scenario the city of Long Beach has been active participant in this. But we are looking to deploy about 20,000 stations just under within this space over the course of the program. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  The second offering within this is what is called our turnkey installation. This is really for multi-family units that are identified in a disadvantage air quality community. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a much tougher subset to fit within within, but it is a \nSPEAKER_02:  part of the program really trying to focus on those hard to hit communities within the service territory where we can potentially offer this. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Lastly, it's the new construction remake this is really looking at 15,000 ports. Most of which are at least half of which we want to target in disadvantaged communities and again its air quality disadvantage. This is really for those buildings that code is required to. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  to have make ready positions but those charging stations were weren't put in place. So the goal of this piece of the program is to really help drive that further implementation and install the charging station. So this really focuses on incentivizing the cost of the installation of the charging station itself knowing that the infrastructure is already in place by code. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So some of the program requirements so the program requirements for this is that you have to be a non-residential customer it goes into a lot of the details on this slide but I'm really going to touch on the high level. Really it is a 10 year program we need charging data from the customer customers are required to report their pricing but it's up to you how you charge your customers really the goal of this is to deploy EV infrastructure into the service territory so customers have options to charge their vehicles upon adoption we know that this is going to be a growing market space just in the pathway towards clean electrification and we know that infrastructure is typically the barrier to adoption so the goal of this is really to streamline that process. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm not sure what happened, but the presentation is looking a little jumbled on my side. \nSPEAKER_02:  but \nSPEAKER_02:  So \nSPEAKER_02:  This slide typically covers the various different program offerings. So this kind of goes into a bit more of the detail in terms of the breakouts within each of the specific offerings. So for example, option one where we build out the infrastructure, you actually have two different options to participate in that. Being a customer, you can have SCE do all the work and we do all the conduits, the wires. \nSPEAKER_02:  etc up to the stub up and then you customer and customer it's not just the city along which it's any commercial customer within the service territory are responsible for the stub ups or you have the option to \nSPEAKER_02:  You can say, SCE, we want to do this work and we don't want SCE to do it. \nSPEAKER_02:  You can do all that work and its customer installed infrastructure and then we would incentivize up to 80% of that project cost. But this kind of goes into a little bit more of the details on some of those other program offerings. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this is really the meat of it. So this slide really captures how the program works, typically for any of customers that have \nSPEAKER_02:  our line of demarcation between where the utility stops and where customer infrastructure starts is really this gray line on this slide. The utilities responsible for the transformation, the service, and then the actual meter. Customers are typically responsible for the panel and then the conduit and wires going to their building. As part of this program, we would potentially cover all of that work and do all the work at including the permitting and transceeing, civil, etc. as associated with these projects, then you as a customer are responsible for procuring that charging station. So what is the orange within this? \nSPEAKER_02:  picture. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this slide really touches on some of the program breakouts. I'm not going to spend a lot of time here, but it's an easy comparison chart of the different program offerings, the goal when we came out with, so this is really the third phase of the program. We had a pilot phase, a bridge phase, and then this is full program. The goal being that we have, that there were lessons learned through the first two phases, and we have more offerings for customers and more options on how they can deploy their infrastructure. So that's really why we do this comparison chart. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we also have an approved product list. This is an important component of the \nSPEAKER_02:  of the program, essentially the ask is that these \nSPEAKER_02:  approved items be meet the safety requirements of the program and that they provide data and really the goal of this program is that it gives options to customers we don't want to deploy charging stations will only service one type of vehicle for going to spend money for infrastructure we wanted to have to be able to charge essentially any sort of vehicle on the marketplace so it's looking for an industry standard. Thanks. Slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So disadvantaged communities, I mentioned this a few times, as part of what we identify as disadvantaged in \nSPEAKER_02:  this program is based upon Cal EPA its air quality disadvantage and not necessarily economically disadvantage a lot of times they align but not always but for the sake of this program it's based upon air quality next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is why it's important. So as part of \nSPEAKER_02:  identifying where this falls in terms of a disadvantaged community or not. \nSPEAKER_02:  Not only are we covering that all the infrastructure costs related to these projects, but we're also incentivizing on the charging stations. So if it's located within an air quality disadvantage community. We're covering 100% of the base costs of the unit. \nSPEAKER_02:  If it's a multi-unit dwelling, it's 50%. \nSPEAKER_02:  All other customers that don't fit within those two, we're still going to incentivize the charging station, but it's only 25% of that base cost. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this is how the rebates work. So for \nSPEAKER_02:  You're going to be looking at the far right hand slide. So for a level one, it's if you're not in a disadvantage community, you'd be getting about 550. Most customers are falling in that level two space. It would be $725 per port. And again, that's per port. So if you get a two port station, you are eligible for up to double that rebate. \nSPEAKER_02:  if you are in a disadvantaged community. \nSPEAKER_02:  and not part of the fortune 1000, then you would get $2,900 per port. So it's. \nSPEAKER_02:  air quality disadvantage plays a significant role and the rebates are significantly higher so not only we paint for all the infrastructure if you're in a disadvantage community you're getting twenty nine hundred dollars per port on the base cost of the unit of the charging station as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this slide really touches on the level of charging stations that this program is focused on. We will have a DC fast charging option. That subset is significantly smaller though. We're only looking at about 225 ports as per that program only because those sites are going to be much more selective. The cost of infrastructure is just significantly more expensive. And we feel like this is the space in the market that we're truly going to reach the largest amount of the population at the most cost effective price. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So EV rates. So as part of participation in the charge ready program, our EV rates are also, we call it the manualization. They're segmented up. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  If you participate between now in 2023 there are no demand charges on the bill and then after that they start to ratchet up until 2029 when you start to pay the full demand charges the goal being to help promote the adoption in this space and \nSPEAKER_02:  get customers accustomed to what a demand charge is. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So additionally, they're... \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the requirements of the program is demand response. There are \nSPEAKER_02:  multiple different ways in which you can participate in demand response and here sort of the time frames associated with that. Most of them the time frames are between that 4 to 9 p.m. time period only because that is when the peak is the peak times for the utility. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  So finally, we have an advisory service where we can come out there and potentially look at any of the fleet sites or sites for multi-family. Any of those. \nSPEAKER_02:  locations where you're not sure if you're a good fit. We're willing to come out there and take a look and see if \nSPEAKER_02:  what you would potentially qualify for or not a lot of these projects are built upon we have to meet eighty a requirements there's a cost per port threshold we have to meet \nSPEAKER_02:  As long as we can meet those really the number of ports drives the ability to do some of these projects if you ask us to do a couple gets a little bit more challenging if they're significant work that the utility needs to do. But the goal being is to find that right balance on the number of ports and what fits and hopefully they align and then we can do the project for you from the utility. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Okay. So I think actually that's it. I'm not sure what happened, but the slide deck that I sent over this one slightly different. \nSPEAKER_02:  but \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, we can just... \nSPEAKER_02:  jump to the Q&A on this. I apologize. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right, no worries. Well, thank you, Brian, for the helpful presentation. Before we get started, can I get a motion on this item? \nSPEAKER_05:  So moved. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. I think so I think moved by Councilman Zendaijas and second by Stacy Mon, by Councilwoman Mungo. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so I have just a few comments and questions to start, Brian. I know that the make ready infrastructure elements are costly. \nSPEAKER_05:  and time consuming with them permitting an inspections. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it's great to see that Southern California Edison is covering the cost of that process. \nSPEAKER_05:  and the rebates for hardware and installation of charging ports themselves. \nSPEAKER_05:  should be very helpful. Question for you. Have you connected with our local small property owners association or our local apartment associations? \nSPEAKER_05:  to identify any... \nSPEAKER_05:  ideal applicants. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I know that we have a whole team that is doing a lot of that work and promotion on that side. And honestly, that's our hardest side to reach. And so if you can make some of those connections, we're more than happy to have those conversations. Those are a big part of the goal. And just seeing how it went through phase one and phase two, not just in Long Beach everywhere. That's the hardest market for us to reach. That said, \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, we have options not only on the residential side, but I didn't this. \nSPEAKER_02:  presentation didn't touch on the medium to heavy duty space, but we have a very similar program just for that as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I'm happy to help. I think it'd be good partners and happy to make introductions of that helpful. Helpful. Who should I reach out to? \nSPEAKER_02:  So I actually work directly with \nSPEAKER_02:  The programs on our site and public works. If you want to reach out to me, I can make those connections with the appropriate parties on the SCE team and make sure that they're reporting it back. \nSPEAKER_02:  to yourself and whoever the \nSPEAKER_02:  the appropriate parties are at \nSPEAKER_02:  the city as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, great. Thank you, Brian. And then I'm next expanding the \nSPEAKER_05:  zero-mission vehicle infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_05:  is massively important for many many reasons. First and foremost, transitioning to zero mission vehicles represent one of the largest. \nSPEAKER_05:  individual choices that resident can make that can help us combat. \nSPEAKER_05:  a climate change. \nSPEAKER_05:  Ann. \nSPEAKER_05:  Secondly, the minimum deployment of multifamily charging infrastructure \nSPEAKER_05:  is a major equity issue and our densest neighborhoods. I know that one of the biggest issue with switching to zero emission vehicles \nSPEAKER_05:  is the \nSPEAKER_05:  development of the charging infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_05:  So increasing access to charging equipment for multi-family dwellings, especially in our dense waterfront and our downtown neighborhoods. \nSPEAKER_05:  is going to be key to promoting equity and \nSPEAKER_05:  better. \nSPEAKER_05:  air quality locally. \nSPEAKER_05:  I see that program one target is to install \nSPEAKER_05:  38,000. \nSPEAKER_05:  charging ports across the SE territory. \nSPEAKER_05:  Do you brain have any estimate on how many? \nSPEAKER_05:  would be ideal. \nSPEAKER_05:  I deal here in Long Beach and what would be the timeline on that goal. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's hard to so in terms of ideal for Long Beach that I think is going to be a question that Long Beach kind of has to push us. We're more than willing to look at as many sites that you want to look at. We have some cities that are more that participate more than others. We. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're agnostic to it. We just want to deploy these out. If the city wants them, if you have the deployment for them, we want to be a partner within that space. In terms of timeline, we just open the program and I can tell you that there was a lot of. \nSPEAKER_02:  customers are excited about it. We got a lot of applications all at once the city themselves submitted quite a few applications. A significant amount for any single city by far and compared to any of our other cities but \nSPEAKER_02:  Right now we're looking at a nine month roughly deployment schedule and that's going to vary depending upon the big question market in here is the what we don't control. So like permitting timeline things like that. So we tell customers nine to 12 months after that we're hoping it's going to tighten up a little bit as customers start to get more and city start to get more accustomed to this type of work. But right now we're seeing about a nine month lead time on these. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Alright, so about nine months for any charging port. Okay, awesome. And also, so I had a constituent ask me if it's possible to install a curbside chargers under this program. \nSPEAKER_05:  He asked about curbsides in retail. \nSPEAKER_05:  and restaurant areas. \nSPEAKER_05:  on the streets adjacent to our parks where residents plan to stay for a while. Have you explored this with our public work staff? \nSPEAKER_02:  So... \nSPEAKER_02:  Curbside, I don't believe we've explored it specifically with Long Beach. I can tell you we're looking at it and we're looking at actually not only deploying from \nSPEAKER_02:  a charging station but other you know future looking technologies and means to do that off of sce assets we're not quite there yet in terms of how \nSPEAKER_02:  that is \nSPEAKER_02:  in terms of unpacking that, but I can tell you we're open to curbside. We're looking at it at some other in some other cities, but we have not looked at it specifically in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  In program 2, what criteria are you using to? \nSPEAKER_05:  to find this managed communities is at the SB 535. \nSPEAKER_02:  Cheers. \nSPEAKER_02:  Double-check. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, SB 535, yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, I'm glad to see that the map has significant parts of Long Beach eligible. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  in any case, I'm how I. \nSPEAKER_05:  How fast might we see this these turnkey installs implemented? \nSPEAKER_05:  and how many can get more beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  We can, I mean, at this point, you're probably about a month. \nSPEAKER_02:  into the program. I want to say you'd probably start. The city actually has some. \nSPEAKER_02:  charge ready ports from the bridge and pilot phase were looking to install significantly more through charge ready to I would say you're probably seven eight months out from a charge ready to deployment. \nSPEAKER_02:  But \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a significant number of applications that are coming all at once down the pipeline. So \nSPEAKER_02:  it's not 1Z2Z, you're looking at 20 plus that are in the pipeline. And so it's going to be a pretty quick deployment. And then \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sure there will be additional phases after that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, awesome. In program number three, I know we have construction cranes pulling up across downtown. \nSPEAKER_05:  and midtown want beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  Have you connected with our development services department to get network with? \nSPEAKER_05:  the developers. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't know if anyone else, so my team has, I have not. But I can make that connection as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  and yeah, and let me know. I'm happy to make introductions there as well if I can help. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  And I'm also... \nSPEAKER_05:  What I didn't see here was any mention of the green rate program. \nSPEAKER_05:  can commercial public and multi-family operators and owners who install who installed charging state charging infrastructure operated through \nSPEAKER_05:  the green rate program. \nSPEAKER_02:  Mm-hmm, that's just kind of a... \nSPEAKER_02:  We call it a rate writer. It's an option in above and beyond to what your normal rate is. You'd be on a time of use rate and there are benefits to participate in charge ready for being on that rate, but you can opt to have the green rate on top of that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I just want you to know that. I know there are many of my constituents. \nSPEAKER_05:  who would prefer to charge their EVs only with green electricity. \nSPEAKER_05:  if possible. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  And then also, so right now I'd like to open this up. Are there any other comments from my colleagues? \nSPEAKER_05:  for questions. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair Allen. Thank you for that great presentation, also Brian. That's really, really thorough. One of the things that I really liked is the incentives. I think that incentives are really great, especially in a program like this. So thank you for that. One of the things that I was wondering is how, \nSPEAKER_00:  Qu\u00e9bec Edm Merda \nSPEAKER_00:  When I get a lot of questions from my constituents are how do we \nSPEAKER_00:  put these in, in. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, the condos and the, you know, homes will, with, you know, built in with multiple homes so that they could use it. Is that something that we're looking at right now as well? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, that would fit under the multi-family and that's you hit it's bottom. That's our hardest \nSPEAKER_02:  market to touch on. \nSPEAKER_02:  but we have, we're specifically targeting those and we have some representative similar to myself. That's not actually my space, but we have representative similar to myself who do work specifically with those customers because we know it's, there's a gap there and we want to meet that market need. So please feel free to reach out. There's actually, if it's not myself, there's a charge ready at sce.com email address that can be emailed and you can feel free to give that out as well. If they reach out to us, someone will be assigned to work specifically with them to help them through that process, although the utility does do the bulk of the work in this. There's still some education to be done on how these work, what these rates are, what is time of use because it's becoming an increasingly larger part of how we operate. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  So. \nSPEAKER_00:  all these were. \nSPEAKER_00:  Uh-huh, and it's especially common. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm in \nSPEAKER_00:  buildings where you own your condo and stuff and you want to, you know, you don't want to use anybody else's utilities to be able to have a charging station. You want it? \nSPEAKER_00:  to be yours. There is a cost associated with it, of course, but \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, they want to be able to do them and how to route that to their utility boxes. \nSPEAKER_00:  is interesting. So yes, I will pass on that information. And also how are we doing? How are you doing outreach? \nSPEAKER_00:  to our community and regards to all the programs and services that are available. \nSPEAKER_00:  in regards to these. \nSPEAKER_02:  So... \nSPEAKER_02:  We have several different programs and how we outreach or a lot of different programs and how we each reach out for each of the programs is all slightly different. We do a lot of social media outreach. We do some, you know, just traditional billboard outreach. More specifically, we have a team that works with chambers and a lot of we try to reach as best as possible in mass. But additionally, we have also partnered with the city on some of these efforts, the sponsor specifically on some of the city related efforts. I think we put. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  We partner to, or we, \nSPEAKER_02:  We paid to get into to get on like the water bill to promote the green rate and things like that. So we're open to ideas. So if you have any specific ideas on how we should target. We're open to those. There's just a lot of different programs and how we reach everyone is always a challenge with so many different areas. But we're. \nSPEAKER_02:  Open, we try to get out as best as possible, but please let us know if there's specific areas. \nSPEAKER_02:  or ways you think we should be targeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Are there any other comments from my colleagues? \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, hearing none, are there a public, I think we have public comment next. \nSPEAKER_08:  Any members of the public that would wish to address the committee, please use the raise your hand function. \nSPEAKER_08:  Our first speaker is Dave Schuigler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Hello, opinion. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, we can. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, great. \nSPEAKER_01:  Please be advised this entire conversation may be subject to violation of AB 117. \nSPEAKER_01:  You don't just have a responsibility council members to sorry for the noise one second. \nSPEAKER_01:  You just have a responsibility to the citizens of Longby. \nSPEAKER_01:  but you also have responsibility to the state of California and to all the CCAs currently operating within it. \nSPEAKER_01:  both for information sharing as well as for \nSPEAKER_01:  keeping \nSPEAKER_01:  the process of Long Beach determining whether it wants to have its own community choice aggregation freed from potential interference. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is the right interference. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's important to note two things. One, a lot of these programs have a lot of if-ands or butts that can't be compared with any publicly available data. Unlike all CCAs, they make their integrated resource planning documents publicly available. They show that they get the environmental performance. I haven't heard a single thing in a climate environmental action committee about how we're going to get actual emissions reductions and actual environmental performance. That's your goal. That's your mission. That's your charge. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other thing. \nSPEAKER_01:  uh... but but but but yeah the uh... presentation uh... changed \nSPEAKER_01:  from when I downloaded it. The SE presentation for this item changed from when I downloaded it. \nSPEAKER_01:  around 12.50pm. \nSPEAKER_01:  to when it was presented this afternoon, and I would like that noted for the record please. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, that is noted. Thank you. Are there any other public comments? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, our next speaker is Pete Marsh. Please begin. \nSPEAKER_03:  I get afternoon councilmember Allen councilmembers and they us and councilmember one go thank you Ryan thank you I thought it was a great presentation and and a good program I appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm an electric vehicle driver for about the last three years. We're on our second one now. And \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm a homeowner in Long Beach, but I support this program's focus on \nSPEAKER_03:  especially the disadvantaged communities, the multifamily. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  I... \nSPEAKER_03:  I like your ratio of the level two versus DC fast chargers for in town charging and for residents. I think that's very appropriate. The DC fast chargers are much more well suited for long distance. I've done. \nSPEAKER_03:  20,000 miles road tripping and so I use \nSPEAKER_03:  fast chargers then and I use a level two charger at home. So I think that's a good ratio. \nSPEAKER_03:  I like the idea about the curbside accessibility. \nSPEAKER_03:  as part of it, you know, as much as you can build that in as makes sense. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I like it. \nSPEAKER_03:  The focus you had, Brian, on an emphasis on integrating it with your demand response program. I think that's critical. \nSPEAKER_03:  as we build the grid of the future. \nSPEAKER_03:  You probably know that better than I probably, but \nSPEAKER_03:  Appreciate it that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  as part of the multifamily. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  focus. I \nSPEAKER_03:  I think the city and \nSPEAKER_03:  Utility \nSPEAKER_03:  are right to be focusing more probably on. \nSPEAKER_03:  ten and fill multi-family buildings rather than owner occupied condos and \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm a solar contractor as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, one of the reasons the solar contractor industry is criticized. \nSPEAKER_03:  currently is. \nSPEAKER_03:  that many of the early adopters of SOAR today have been \nSPEAKER_03:  more well-off families, especially homeowners. And that's because of the \nSPEAKER_03:  it's \nSPEAKER_03:  It's an infant industry and its infancy, but it's also a real tough not to crack with the benefits accruing differently the costs between tenants and landlords. And so. \nSPEAKER_03:  if we can. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  support. \nSPEAKER_03:  This was, plung3X \nSPEAKER_03:  programs like this I think that's beneficial. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's see. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  That's really all the comments I have on the EV charging program. Thank you. I think it's \nSPEAKER_03:  It's going to be really important to the transition as we move to sort of hashtag, let's go to everything. \nSPEAKER_03:  for the committee. And I know you have already items on the future agenda for this but a related topic of \nSPEAKER_03:  following closely after electrification of transportation is \nSPEAKER_03:  electrifying. \nSPEAKER_03:  building stock. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  existing building stock in particular is a real tough nut to crack. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I look forward to those future discussions. \nSPEAKER_03:  There are some. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh \nSPEAKER_03:  I've been in touch a little bit with Connor already about this council member Alan but there are several \nSPEAKER_03:  several programs. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  that the city could look \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. That can be put below comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  Awesome. All right, can I call for a vote please? \nSPEAKER_06:  one is in Dejas. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. Bye, sheer mongo. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Alan. \nSPEAKER_06:  I wish you the best! \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So, so I'm mad and clerk, I know that we have closed session at three and we are running away behind. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know in the interest of time I know we have our next presenter here. I know that Councilwoman Mungo was really excited about this but I wanted to see can we move count item number four. \nSPEAKER_05:  to our next meeting just to ensure that we have enough time. \nSPEAKER_05:  to do the presentation justice. \nSPEAKER_06:  Absolutely, yes you can. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and then also Madam Clark can I also request in the since we have four minutes to get into a closed session can I take items. \nSPEAKER_05:  five, six and seven. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  in one vote is that allowed? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Let's do it. Can you call the calling 4 or 5, 6 and 7? Please can you read them? \nSPEAKER_06:  Item five. \nSPEAKER_06:  is a recommendation to request the future presentation on California's e-bike grant program. \nSPEAKER_06:  Item 6. \nSPEAKER_06:  is a recommendation to request a future presentation on efforts aimed at removing trucks from the I-710. \nSPEAKER_06:  item. \nSPEAKER_06:  Seven. \nSPEAKER_06:  is a recommendation to request a future presentation on reducing reliance on city revenue from oil production memo and next step. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, can I get a motion? \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilman. \nSPEAKER_04:  This is Council in Mungo and I would support those items. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would. \nSPEAKER_04:  also be interested in adding as we reduce the reliance on \nSPEAKER_04:  oil presentation to include. \nSPEAKER_04:  alternative revenue streams to maintain services if you're okay with that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, I'm I'm \nSPEAKER_05:  perfectly fine with that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I'm, I'll make the most of it. \nSPEAKER_05:  \uc774 \uc788\uc744 Grac KO \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, perfect. Can I call for the vote? \nSPEAKER_06:  Can we get public comment on these items first, Chair? Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  At this time, if there's any member of the book that wishes to speak on any of these items, please use a raised hand function. \nSPEAKER_08:  seen done that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Councilwoman Zendai has. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. Nice to meet you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Fear Allen. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then so Madam Clerk, do we need a vote to continue item number four? \nSPEAKER_06:  No, we do not. You're carrying it over and noting that you're"
