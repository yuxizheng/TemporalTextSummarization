        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Could I have a motion on the recommendation to discuss and approve the application and selection process for the upcoming Commissioner Vacancy including timing interview questions and the interview process. \nSPEAKER_05:  So before we actually go into the process, \nSPEAKER_05:  I just like to say that Luke we're all really really going to miss you. We understand family comes first and your family has a big opportunity outside of the state of California and our loss is Illinois's gain and no politics in Chicago is vastly different. But I think I'm going to present this now. We have a little token of our esteem for your time with the commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's very sweet. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Except. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  This is our standard. \nSPEAKER_05:  It has an ethical lens so that you're reminded throughout your life. You already look at everything through an ethical lens, but just a reminder to everyone that you are highly ethical person. And... \nSPEAKER_05:  We were looking forward to you being on this commission for a long time and doing other great things for the city. But we were very fortunate to have your wise counsel with us while we did. And we also thank you for letting us know Nick last month that you were planning to leave after this meeting because as we started looking over the time frame, there has to go into letting somebody, getting somebody replaced, 60 days is fast. So before we actually go into the item, is there anything you want it's there you want to wait until after the meeting? \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm happy to wait. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  just thank you so much everyone that's incredibly thoughtful and I will miss everyone sincerely and this has been an incredible opportunity and I can we can all speak further about it later but thank you so much that's I'm very touched really \nSPEAKER_05:  So, Heather, you want to go over the calendar that we put together? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you chair. So yes this staff report that you received with the agenda will just go over that quickly and answer any questions that you might have so like the chair was saying the charter guidelines for vacancies we have 60 days to fill commissioner feedlers vacancy that time clock starts that's effective tomorrow October 12. So the commission must use the same method that we used for the initial appointment for commissioner feedler. The new commissioner will serve the remainder of commissioner feedlers term which will conclude in June of 2024 June 30th following the expiration of the partial term the commission has the discretion to reappoint the incumbent or initiate an application process for a different commissioner. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  appointments to a partial term do not count towards the term of Office of the Ethics Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the proposed selection process that you have in front of you, if this item is approved the way it's written or with any edits that you make today, the application will launch tomorrow, Thursday, October 12th, and will conclude Monday, October 30th. Staff will manage that part. \nSPEAKER_00:  Tuesday, October 31st, to Friday, November 3rd, staff will review application and resumes to ensure all applicants have met the minimum required qualifications. The list of qualified candidates will be placed on the commission's Wednesday, November 8th, agenda for discussion and selection of applicants for interviews. \nSPEAKER_00:  To ensure fair and transparent selection process, all identifying information will be redacted from applications and resumes before given to the commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  Wednesday, November 8th, commission will discuss and select applicant pool. \nSPEAKER_00:  Wednesday, November 15, interviews and final selection, a Billie Jean King Library, time to be determined. And if we need an additional day to do interviews and final selection, Wednesday, December 6 has been tentatively held for that. \nSPEAKER_00:  The application, you have a copy of the application as it looks now. We've used that, or we put that together using Microsoft Forms and is based on the previous Commission application that was used to select Commissioner Feedler as well as the current City of Long Beach. Commissioners, boards and committees application. \nSPEAKER_00:  There are minimum qualifications that the applicant will have to meet. That staff will be looking for as we review applications and resumes. That includes they must be a resident of Long Beach must submit a resume. And then there's other do's and don'ts under qualifications. There's also desirable qualifications that you all can take a look at. \nSPEAKER_00:  Interview questions we've given you a list of sample questions that we gave you in 2020. \nSPEAKER_00:  to help you select questions that you may find valuable. There's also an outline of the interview process. The entire process has to occur. \nSPEAKER_00:  during open and public brown act meeting so all of this will take place publicly including the interviews and selection. I know that we had talked about possibly having a closed session but that is not. \nSPEAKER_00:  That can't be done by this body. For outreach, we've suggested doing a public notice. We'll use the commission's email. \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll also post on our website a city social media post as allowed. We'll request the applications or the notice to be put in council district newsletters as well as the go-long beach city wide newsletter. And then we'll also reach out to our neighborhood resource center to use their email address or contacts. And with that, that concludes my report. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So the first day that we'll do this November 8th is our regular meeting. The November 15th date, hopefully everyone can make that work. Unfortunately, we have to have this done before our December meeting. So that's why the next two dates are between our November meeting and our December meeting. It's just the December meeting is like four days outside of our 60 day window. But we're hoping that maybe we can get that done on the 15th depending on how many candidates we have. So everyone's okay with the dates. Everyone's okay with the application process. Is there anything else that anyone would like to see on the application? \nSPEAKER_04:  and that I just want to question. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Heather, thank you. I have a question about the tentative December 6 date. \nSPEAKER_04:  the if needed part. I'm assuming that if we \nSPEAKER_04:  have to conduct. \nSPEAKER_04:  interviews that do not. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we cannot accommodate on the previous date. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_00:  It could be that or it could be we've just run out of time that we've given ourselves that day depending on the pool of applicants that we get that will determine really how much time the commission needs. \nSPEAKER_04:  and so the commission is not considering. \nSPEAKER_04:  grant you an opportunity to someone who may be sick. \nSPEAKER_04:  on the 15th. \nSPEAKER_04:  November. \nSPEAKER_00:  that hasn't been discussed, but that can be discussed now. \nSPEAKER_04:  I only bring it up because that was my experience. I still can't let it go. But in March 2020, I was a separate interview and Omar Ramos from... \nSPEAKER_04:  HR. \nSPEAKER_04:  never return my email. \nSPEAKER_04:  about rescheduling. So I just made an assumption that you weren't rescheduling people who called in sec. \nSPEAKER_04:  is that what we're doing here because that was not. \nSPEAKER_04:  afford to me. \nSPEAKER_04:  2020. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we could use the sixth of that day. \nSPEAKER_05:  to reschedule, but it would have to be the six because we have the tight window and part of the application process is also notifying people that would be the 15th. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  The other thing that we could look, you know, can't the Billie Jean King can we do remote access so that somebody could we could look into that also. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that if somebody was sick that maybe we could do a video conference with them, but we'll look at the opportunities. But we can't go beyond the six because we have to make that final choice no later than the six in order to meet our obligation by the charter. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, we have thought about the 29th, but we were trying to avoid the Thanksgiving holiday. And as I remember, Taylor and Heather are out at a conference that week. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that really wasn't going to work. They're being emphasized. \nSPEAKER_05:  will actually be out the week of this. \nSPEAKER_00:  the week of the week of the six. But we were discussing holiday impact on that the week of the 29th. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  but we can still discuss it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  to the 296 somewhere in there. \nSPEAKER_00:  END \nSPEAKER_05:  We can figure it out. Hopefully everyone stays well. They're feeling good. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  And the questions, are we okay with the questions on the back? And the second page of Attachment B are the questions that we asked last time. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so really Commissioner Schottwell and I were part of putting those questions together. And maybe the three of you that had to answer those questions were they, were they sufficient, were they a little, and you may remember we gave everyone the questions in advance. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think Commissioner Shotwell and I feel like that gave us the information that we needed to make our selection. \nSPEAKER_01:  The only thing in looking at the other questions that were there, the second question that would carry over is what is your interest in becoming involved in the City's ethics commission? And some of the other jurisdictions said, why do you want to be, why do you want to serve as a member of the City of the United States? \nSPEAKER_01:  a blank commissioner and ethics, city ethics commissioner. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's asking for the same information. It just... \nSPEAKER_01:  Strikes me. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the Y is an easier \nSPEAKER_01:  It is just more straightforward. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know if it strikes others the same way. \nSPEAKER_01:  I do think that you elicited the information that was appropriate. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the questions you use. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  any other comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  I would only add that some of the other questions that I saw the other cities do. I actually don't think that many of those add too much value or are getting right to the point of what the service on the commission is about. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, if we're okay with this and see no members of the public for comment, can we call the vote in the vote is to approve the timeline, the questions and the process? \nSPEAKER_05:  with the caveat that we will be looking at how to schedule people who are sick within the time frame that we have. \nSPEAKER_01:  need a motion in a second. \nSPEAKER_05:  We had. \nSPEAKER_05:  There it is. Commissioner Arnor and I. Commissioner DeBio. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  It wasn't on my screen. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm trying to be good about doing it first thing."

Benedictis. So before we go into this item, I just would like to announce that the vice chair and I push Taylor again about the possibility of serving on more than one committee. And I'm happy to report that she has reviewed everything and rendered a decision that we can serve on more than one committee as long as we all remember that we cannot discuss what we're working on in any other committee. So when we meet with the committee, it's only to discuss those items that that committee is discussing. And I think that may have been a concern last month when we were discussing this if we would have enough people to do this and the other work that we've been doing. So with that, are there any discussion comments? \nSPEAKER_01:  Do we want to move forward with a vote to approve our and we don't have to set up the committee right now because JT When are the first financials do? \nSPEAKER_02:  Let me check on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not before November meeting. We could set up a committee in November, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I think November should be fine. Like there are like \nSPEAKER_02:  some filing that have taken place ready for this election cycle. Okay. But those are like... \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  not official candidates at this point because nomination period doesn't start until November. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you are interested in serving on that committee, please let Heather know before our November meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  I just chair I think because of the way the recommendation is written that we would need to clarify that it sounds like the motion is that the ethics commission intends to create an ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we would \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  And the motion doesn't let us do that today, does it?

Do you do that Commissioner Shotwell? \nSPEAKER_01:  You just stay in the mic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  and commissioners that changes okay with you also. Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  and seeing no members of the public. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, you want to speak commission to it? Oh, you do. OK. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, it says you want to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think you signed up for the last item, but you were on the wrong one. I could clear that out if you'd like. \nSPEAKER_01:  When we lost our second of the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are we good to call the vote?

The survey for the community outreach for our lobbyists, ordinance recommendations leading up to our special meeting for the 25th. That survey launched last week in our four languages. \nSPEAKER_00:  This meeting will be at 5.30 so just a reminder to have that on your schedule or your calendar. This will be a hybrid meeting but commissioners all have to be here in person. \nSPEAKER_00:  The survey will end October 19th. We had to go through a few things to actually get that launched, but it did launch successfully, and then we'll close that on the 19th, so we can put the data together for you leading up to the 25th. The ad hoc will, wait, that was my notes from the last one. So we used a public notice to get the survey out. We also used social media. We're seeing it as well in council district newsletters, so that's good. So far, we have 154 responses, average time to complete is about 18 and a half minutes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Also, I wanted to confirm that one meeting is officially launching, so we're going from Legislature and Granicus to one meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  That will launch on they're using it for the council meeting on October 24th, so the week of the 23rd So you will be one of the \nSPEAKER_00:  earlier commissions to use this new system with our special meeting on the 25th. So the clerk's office is asking this commission to come 45 minutes to an hour earlier on the 25th. So if that all possible, if you all can make it at 4.30, maybe even 4 o'clock, I imagine the public will start showing up around 5 o'clock for the special meeting. And that way they'll walk you through the new system and well I or not kinks as we go. \nSPEAKER_00:  JT wanted me to share with you that the system is a little bit more complicated, which is why we just need a little bit more extra time so I know \nSPEAKER_00:  Most of you are coming from work that day, but if you can make it a little bit earlier, that would be great. \nSPEAKER_00:  Help line update so we have officially parted ways with the auditor. So we are now working towards our own help line, our own telephone line and our own website. So I'm working with NeoGov on those changes, but just wanted to confirm that we are. \nSPEAKER_00:  going our separate ways. I know some of you have been absent the last couple of meetings, but we just got to a point where \nSPEAKER_00:  The technology that NeoGov essentially had promised us really wasn't the technology that we were getting and there really was no way to separate our stuff from the auditor stuff without getting in each other's space. So that just wasn't realistic for our best to continue. So unfortunately we had to part ways and I think some of the commissioners from the start wanted us to have our own separate help line anyway so we'll start working with NeoGov to establish that and then we'll start the outreach to undo everything that we've done so far. But still it's a good time to fix stuff. And then the chair already mentioned it strategic plan updates so we are moving forward Jorge and I met with the chair and vice chair last week to put together you know a framework of first steps or next step so Jorge and I are working on. \nSPEAKER_00:  reaching out to potential consultants and just figuring out what that looks like. Jorge has sent a couple of emails just to start conversations with potential consultants that may help us do our strategic plan. So we're actively \nSPEAKER_00:  researching and we'll have a better update for you next month. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that is my report. \nSPEAKER_00:  Are there any questions for her? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for your time. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, shot well. \nSPEAKER_02:  Just one logistical question. So on the 25th, so I just want to confirm, what time would you like us as commissioners here? \nSPEAKER_00:  And now before the meeting, I'm going to ask you to be here at 4 o'clock only because if this meeting is as popular as I think it's going to be, I imagine the public will start showing up at 5 o'clock. \nSPEAKER_02:  and now it's for the \nSPEAKER_02:  So, and meeting starts at 5 or 5. 5.30. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then you anticipate that you set it three hours. \nSPEAKER_00:  We're giving ourselves three hours, but we'll see. So yes, I would give yourself three hours. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Any other questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. Need to vote. Oh, was it supposed to take a motion on this to accept? \nSPEAKER_01:  to receive and file. \nSPEAKER_01:  I need a second on receiving and filing.

And does the other ad hoc have any? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure, we can try. We've been moving along with drafting conflict of interest and our gift policies. We're working with staff on what is the best method to move those along. And I think I'll defer to council. I think you all remember we were looking towards, there's two different options that we can proceed with policy resolution versus ordinance. But I think staff is best qualified to tell us what's the best method for our commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. So initially we had discussed pursuing a resolution and the benefits to doing a resolution. They're a lot easier to amend a lot. \nSPEAKER_01:  less time consuming to amend, an ordinance typically takes two readings, and then it takes another 31 days after the mayor signs it to go into effect. What we're finding with how robust the ethics policies are is that I think an ordinance would be better to manage how robust this is going to be, and the content, it'll make it more accessible. I think \nSPEAKER_01:  The tentative recommendation right now is we have a couple spaces in the municipal code for an actual title. And by the way the municode is set up is that we have the charter and then the municipal code. In the municipal code we have titles of major \nSPEAKER_01:  I guess themes of laws, right? General provisions, I'm working on one that's for elections. We have one that manages staff, one that's public health. So, one's business license. So the idea of creating a code that would be specific to ethics, and ethics regulations. \nSPEAKER_01:  It would make it easier from like a definition standpoint. And then we have so many different groups of people that we have to account for, whereas we're trying, going through this process, resolution feels like it doesn't make as much sense. We could use chapters to manage the information and eat, I think it'll make a lot more sense when we lay it out. I know this is very in the weeds, but the conclusion is that I think an ordinance \nSPEAKER_01:  We've changed our mind. I've changed my mind. And ordinance would be a better idea. And then looking at other cities, that seems to be... \nSPEAKER_01:  how some of them are doing it as well. There's also a gravitas and a little bit of permanence with an ordinance, even though it is harder to change. I think it does help convey the seriousness of it for whatever reason in people's minds, even though a policy on ethics is equally as important that it's a law, and we'll have to think through enforceability in articulating what that means, because I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm pretty confident that a misdemeanor won't be appropriate in 99% of the situations, but we can articulate what discipline looks like and \nSPEAKER_01:  We have some other good models to work off of and how to manage that. So we hit a little bit of a hiccup because we're working on reformatting. \nSPEAKER_01:  The current recommendation that the ad hoc is working on into this new format, which will take a little bit of time. And then we'll we'll be cooking with oil once we get to that place and hopefully get a recommendation to you and something to red line pretty soon. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if I understand correctly, an ordinance will apply across the entire city, so it will cover harbor and utilities. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So regardless of what we adopt, we'll have to articulate who it applies to. The intent, and I don't want to completely speak for the ad hoc, but in our discussions, the point is to create policies that apply citywide, regardless of department, so that there's consistency in policy. So as opposed to what the structure we have now, city manager has policies for all city manager departments independent. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, there's a bunch of islands, same government. \nSPEAKER_01:  But we're all doing our own little cultures and rules and things that differ. So the idea is to have an umbrella for everyone. So yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then that gets to my second question of who within the city owns. \nSPEAKER_03:  the policies, if you will. I'll know if it's then an ordinance, but if somebody wants to look up, what's the policy on conflict of interest? Where will they find it other than the municode? \nSPEAKER_01:  So the idea is to codify in the municode and then create an accessible, digestible, not lawyer version of what the rules are in the ethics, in the good government guide that we're working on creating. So \nSPEAKER_01:  it'll be repeated. \nSPEAKER_01:  right it'll be in two forms you can look up the pure version of it in the ordinance or there'll be a manageable version of it in the good government guide and then the long-term goal when we get there is that we'll have super awesome videos and digestible content about what each of these policies and rules are so that they're accessible to staff they're easy to understand and everybody understands that the rules that apply to them. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then that would live on the ethics commission page. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know if we've gotten that far from an education standpoint. It would be, we have a learn platform. The content would most likely be there for staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  That starts to get out of my purview and we haven't, like I said, had that conversation yet that would be a staff conversation and I think \nSPEAKER_01:  what the commission is interested in, whether it's appropriate to have it there, you know, those kinds of things. So. \nSPEAKER_03:  So being an ordinance in the municode would not restrict our ability to then put the policies where appropriate on the intranet. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh no. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just wanted to make sure because no. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to make \nSPEAKER_01:  No. \nSPEAKER_01:  Putting it in the municode, what's it in one location that everybody, regardless of what department, you know you can at least go to the municode to find it. And then we're working, of course, perpetually on an accessible way to provide the content to staff in one location beyond the municode. \nSPEAKER_03:  \ub3c4\uc911!! \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a lot of moving parts. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you for your shot well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, and thank you. So I've come around on this, so I would like the approach. The couple of questions that I'd like to ask now before we get back into the ad hoc is one, well, it may just be one question, and then I support what Commissioner Pollock was asking about in terms of, we'll be able to kind of put everything together where employees of the city can find it or others in the city can find it. The question I have is how used to, we don't have to have an answer for this now. It can be later on, but how used to complying with city ordinances are the employees of the commission. So I'm a stranger to this type of an environment, and so I know city ordinances apply to all citizens of the city, people interacting, but is it a normal place where city employees would go for some of the rules and apply to them? No, there would be an answer. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, it would be unusual. But the current system. \nSPEAKER_01:  is it depends on your department where you go typically to access the information where \nSPEAKER_01:  individuals across multiple departments are going to different spaces to access the rules that apply to them if that makes sense. \nSPEAKER_00:  That makes sense and I think that really is, give that kids to it and then I like the approach of regardless of where it's housed and we can are able to kind of present it in the ethics guy ethics handbook along with where we would show it on the basically the internet within the city so people have clear access to everything applies to them. I like the universal approach. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and it gives us a space to cover the legal part. \nSPEAKER_01:  but then make it digestible, right? To plug the holes and put all the... \nSPEAKER_01:  parts that you don't like having in the guy. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? That make sure that the policy is clear, but then creating a digestible version that's accessible to folks. So... \nSPEAKER_00:  Good to have good happy medium on guidelines and then I imagine when we get to Presenting it to the commission we can also present the commission with a the steps for how it's fall how it's going to be adopted Who actually formally adopts it the timeline for that plan for that? Thank you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I can help with that. No problem. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Any other questions or comments on this item? \nSPEAKER_02:  seeing that and seeing no members of the public present can we have the vote please. \nSPEAKER_04:  motion carries."
