Good afternoon, honorable. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair Mongo and committee members. I'm Katie Nomura, Deputy City Manager here to present the Cannabis Cultivation Tax and Retail Tax Feasibility Studies. And to kick us off, we have Valencia Mota, our Cannabis Program Manager. \nSPEAKER_04:  Hi, good afternoon. \nSPEAKER_04:  Again, to pick start a presentation, I will be providing some background on the Feats Abilities Studies and Campus Ordinances. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_04:  On March 15th City Council directed staff to explore the feasibility of repealing the cultivation tax for medical and the built use cannabis similar similarly on make 10 City Council direct the staff to explore the feasibility of reducing the adult use recal tax rate To align with the medical tax rate please note that due to the interrelationship of these requests these feasibility studies were combined into one comprehensive report release the City Council as a yesterday, August 17th. \nSPEAKER_02:  And Nancy, can I ask a question beforehand? \nSPEAKER_02:  It's my understanding that state law has changed since these two requests came in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, that is correct and we will be covering it, I believe. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. Great. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let me go to the next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I should on this slide the medical cannabis ordinance and cannabis business license tax ordinance known as measure and measure and or both public on November 8 2016 while the adult use cannabis ordinance was passed by city council on the light 10 2018. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  It is important to know that the cannabis equity program is established as part of this ordinance. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Moving on to the city's cannabis structure, the chart is a breakdown of the tax rates for each license type under medical and adult use cannabis. The cultivation rate is the same for medical and adult use cannabis, which is currently set up $13.41 per foot of canopy space. Please note that the tax was originally set up $12 but has increased in the passage of measure and may as a result of an annual adjustment of the consumer price index or CPI at 7 or in the ordinance. \nSPEAKER_04:  The adult use cannabis retail tax rate is said at 8% of gross receipts, while the medical tax rate is said at 6% of gross receipts, when no changes to either tax since the path to job measure MA. \nSPEAKER_04:  It is important to know that manufacturing distribution and log testing license types under medical and a field use for initially said at 6% but were reduced to 1% by city council in early 2020. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_04:  The cannabis taxes at the state level are imposed and regulated by the Department of Tax and P and administration. The 50% excites as is based on the average market price for all cannabis business sites except except for cultivation. \nSPEAKER_04:  The cultivation tackles previously in close and it's not really from the way in ounces for cannabis flower leave the first cannabis plants this tax was recently eliminated as part of the fiscal year 2022 to 2020 3 state state budget and approval assembly bill 195 also known as a cannabis tax reform trade of the trailer bill. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  As part of the speed's ability study staff, research cannabis tax structures and comparable large cities, which are selected based on similar populations, I've cannabis license types, tax structures and recent tax reform policies. \nSPEAKER_04:  I've shown in the table San Jose and Los Angeles have the highest growth receipts at 10% for adult use retail tax rate followed by the long beach and followed by long beach and send you equal 8% and friends know at 4%. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oakland and San Francisco have similar tax structures with their high-rise retail tax rate category at 5%. Fresno is the only city that hasn't posed the cultivation tax per square foot like Wall Street. All other cities based the cultivation tax on the percentage of gross receipts, which affords businesses the ability to grow a self-cantivist first and then pay taxes. As opposed to paying a flat rate based on the square footage of canopy space, which does not account if the business is had a successful grow or sales. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Continuing on with the list of comparable cities as I mentioned I mentioned Oakland earlier in Oakland is the only city with the tier tax structure for equity and non equity businesses. This table shows the adult use retail tax rate based on a range of grocery seats generated for each business type the cultivation tax rates are shown on the next slide. \nSPEAKER_04:  Similar to the adult use tactics, the cultivation tactics are based on a range of gross received with the specific distinction made between indoor and outdoor cultivation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Staff also reaches cannabis tax ruptures and neighboring jurisdictions to examine market competition locally, specifically along the 405-3 corridor. \nSPEAKER_04:  Maywood and Los Angeles have the highest retail tax rate at 10% followed by Santa Ana and La Unbeata 8%. \nSPEAKER_04:  Both are has the highest cultivation tax rate at $15 per square foot of Canopy Space among the neighboring cities. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  The list of neighboring jurisdictions continues with the unequal for 80 and incorporated areas of Los Angeles County. The county recently announced a proposed tax structure for the November 8, 2022 ballot for cannabis businesses. If approved by the voters of cultivation tax rate would be initially set between $2 to $7 depending on the specific cultivation activity and 4% of gross receipts for adult use retail. The initial tax rates would then increase beginning on July of 2026, rate you from $2 to $10 per square foot, a full deviation and 6% of gross receipts for adult use retail. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_04:  That posted a series of round people discussion with licensed cultivators and retailers including or pending equity cultivators. The purpose of these discussion was to solicit beefback on what other businesses believe. Given elimination and or reduction of the cultivation and adult use retail tax would one. \nSPEAKER_04:  Encourage businesses operating in the illicit markets to join the legal market to increase the number of legal cannabis businesses in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_04:  three, impact the local cannabis industry, their business and or vertically integrated businesses. \nSPEAKER_04:  and for impact of the pricing of cannabis goods, consumer habits, sales at retail, and or tax revenue. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  from these round table discussions, staff identified common themes expressed by both cold sabedators and retailers, including \nSPEAKER_04:  which I will call some of these here, little to no impact on the elicit market, as local taxes are not the sole deciding factor on whether to enter the legal market. Other factors include consumer-based regulatory compliance. \nSPEAKER_04:  and unlimited and commercial and industrial space within the permitted areas, state taxes, and inadequate enforcement of neighboring cities. \nSPEAKER_04:  Other feedback received by the businesses was if this will help reduce or debt ceiling and provide financial stability in such a competitive and volatile market. \nSPEAKER_04:  Another commenting would be competitive tax rates with neighboring cities, specifically though, again, along the 405 freeway, which was the best way to encourage consumers to participate in the legal market. \nSPEAKER_04:  And lastly, a lesser tax burden upfront may reduce startup challenges for equity business, especially the eight new equity dispensaries, entering and establishing competitive market, which may further saturate it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Measure and a revenues includes all cannabis tax revenues for each of the cannabis license tax categories. The table shows actual revenues collected for fiscal year 18 through fiscal year 21. Revenues and fiscal year 18 were low due to the slow start of businesses becoming licensed. \nSPEAKER_04:  for revenues nearly doubling during the pandemic in fiscal year 20. We've estimated revenues at fiscal 21 levels at 12 million a year, but it is unclear whether it will remain at these levels. And as a reminder, adult use cannabis retail start on taxes generated the highest amount on 9.7 million, which is equivalent to 80 percent of all revenues. With medical cannabis cultivation taxes following out about 1 million. \nSPEAKER_00:  And as ever. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_04:  In fact, on the cultivation factor of any such on the table or based on a reduction of $1 increments. The fiscal impact of eliminating the cultivation tax of the 1.1 million equivalent to 9%. \nSPEAKER_04:  if the cultivation tax rate were effectively reduced to zero. \nSPEAKER_04:  Any future increases or reinstatement of the tax are repirable to the public. \nSPEAKER_04:  However, \nSPEAKER_04:  If the tax rates are not eliminated and simply reduced under the established threshold threshold, then voter approval is not required for future tax rate increases. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_04:  And now, in fact, on the retail tax revenues I've shown in the table are basically 1% increment reduction. If the, now if the adult use retail taxes reduced to 6% to align with the medical cannabis retail tax rate, the total revenue loss would be approximately 2.4 million on fiscal 23 revenues. If the adult use cannabis retail taxes are eliminated, this would account for a revenue loss of 9.7 million equivalent to 80% and measure a revenues. \nSPEAKER_04:  next life piece and I will now pass it on to Katie to go over potential scenario that impacts the services. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. So this slide is just to give an overview of what, you know, what it could look like, what we're looking at. And so in one of the scenarios, if you eliminate cultivation tax and a 1% reduction of the adult use tax that would have a revenue loss of 2.3 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you eliminate both the cultivation tax and adult use retail tax that has a revenue loss of 11 million, so there's a range of things that could happen. \nSPEAKER_05:  If we chose to defer all cannabis taxes for one year, that has a minimal fiscal impact because deferral would imply they still owe the money, but we would not collect it for a year. But it did, while it could provide temporary relief, it could impose \nSPEAKER_00:  but it does. \nSPEAKER_05:  a burden on the businesses paying both the deferred taxes and the New Year's taxes at the same time. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh, alternatively, if we were to go around, let's say, for going the taxes for a year, that would be a equivalent of eliminating them and would require a vote of the public to re-state. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then moving on to scenario four. If we could choose to annually adjust taxes, subscribe revenues do not exceed an established baseline and it's to maintain level of service. \nSPEAKER_05:  This would have nowhere of a new loss assuming the baseline is set to our estimated 12 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  And in scenario five we have it set to reduce adult use and medical cultivation and retail taxes for equity businesses. This would result in no revenue loss as equity businesses are still starting up and they have not contributed in our estimated $12 million in revenue. \nSPEAKER_05:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so any reduction to measure and may revenues will have an impact on the general fund and the program funded by it. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll see you out there. \nSPEAKER_05:  particularly measure and may funding has been used to fund the cannabis program, racial equity, public health and safety and contributes to the budget stabilization fund as shown on this slide. Next slide, thanks. \nSPEAKER_05:  In addition, there have been enhancements made in the proposed fiscal year 23 budget as part of those fundings to \nSPEAKER_05:  support homeless services such as another reach team counselors supporting the proactive homeless initiative. It also helps to support other programs such as translation services, the fire departments, \nSPEAKER_05:  Diversity Recruitment Program. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then also the Park Safety Investor Program and the Office of Veteran Affairs as shown on this slide. \nSPEAKER_05:  And next like you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So staff's recommendation today is to reduce the adult use in medical cannabis cultivation and retail taxes for equity businesses. As this is an alignment with the city's goal to lift up equity and to also support our cannabis equity program. \nSPEAKER_05:  It also helps that \nSPEAKER_05:  It will help businesses, these equity businesses that are entering an already established market that have their brands and consumer bases already set up. \nSPEAKER_05:  This would level the playing field as the existing businesses were able to enter a new market where they didn't have to compete with others. This could also we've heard anecdotally that throughout the state there are instances where non equity businesses do not want to partner with. \nSPEAKER_05:  equity businesses and so this could create a more level playing field where they can reduce their prices and become more competitive as a partner and so we need to work with a retailer. \nSPEAKER_05:  and this next slide please. \nSPEAKER_05:  This concludes our presentation and we're here for any questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's start with public comment and then we'll dive into \nSPEAKER_02:  Committee member comments. \nSPEAKER_00:  If there are any members of the public that would just be on this item, please use the raise hand feature or dial star 9. \nSPEAKER_00:  seen none, that can include public comment for the item. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great presentation. It's my understanding that the committee will provide some feedback and then you'll be making a revised presentation to the full council on Tuesday. \nSPEAKER_05:  We are next. \nSPEAKER_05:  is the VOC on next Tuesday. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, um. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I love your lists in the beginning about the comparisons of cities and what those tax rates are. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think it would be really helpful for us if those were in order from highest to lowest instead of \nSPEAKER_02:  Trying to figure that out. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that it's also important to put in there the cities that touch our city. \nSPEAKER_02:  that do not have approved systems in place at all. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. \nSPEAKER_02:  So like Hawaiian gardens, Los Alamedos, Ross Moore touches Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  Unincorporated LA County. \nSPEAKER_02:  Touch us long beach, Lakewood touches long beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  If those are not approved, \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's see that if they are approved and they're just not comparable cities, then I'd want to know that because when we talk about another slide, the the advantage disadvantage and the market share, I think that it's helpful to know where those competitors are. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  the chart regarding outdoor and indoor. \nSPEAKER_02:  Cultivation, our city only has one type. What type is that? \nSPEAKER_02:  indoor. \nSPEAKER_02:  Correct. Indoor cultivation, yes. We don't allow for any outdoor cultivation. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So I don't think that's even necessary. I think it just provides some confusion. Maybe put a footnote and say outdoor cultivation is available upon request. But I mean, if we spent money, \nSPEAKER_02:  researching something that our city does not allow. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't think that was a great part on our management of that contract. We talk about 8 to 10% taxes for those of you who are familiar with. \nSPEAKER_02:  starting a business. Sometimes you'll choose to go the franchise route because it comes with systems and all of those things and they take 8 to 10% of grocery seats. One of the things I always felt really great about was that since our tax rate was 8 to 10%, it didn't make us a viable option for outside \nSPEAKER_02:  franchises to come into our city and kind of gobble up that market share. We really had a lot of locally grown home grown. \nSPEAKER_02:  opportunities, but I do see a big opportunity, especially in our equity partner side to potentially eliminating that because it would be replaced with that franchise cost. And those franchises provide additional training and resources. \nSPEAKER_02:  like a kind of a turnkey operation. \nSPEAKER_02:  for people to open up. And I think that in equities type situations, that could make a lot of sense. They also have the ability to get out of that contract in a few years, when those systems are up and they're educated on that. It's like a, \nSPEAKER_02:  A fee for a... \nSPEAKER_02:  School of Hard Knocks, would you say, where someone's over your shoulder investing in you and making sure you're successful. So I'm open to and I'd love to hear councilman Allen's ideas, but I'd be open to really looking at reducing these fees for \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Those equity partners. \nSPEAKER_02:  Slide 13. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think you should post on that page the percentage that you stated of what percentage of this revenue is adult use and what percentage is medical. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then I think that the difference too is you're showing \nSPEAKER_02:  We lose this much or that much. Start with the main number. Our revenue is this. And then show how it goes down. \nSPEAKER_02:  with each number. \nSPEAKER_02:  What's the estimate of the number? We can do the math in our head. They give you goes from $8 million to $7 million. That's $1 million. We get that. \nSPEAKER_02:  But it's very confusing to have the blanks at the top and I was trying to do that math in my head. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Site 14, add with that annual revenue number, looks like. \nSPEAKER_02:  I love the idea of deferring taxes, but I do say that when those taxes become due. \nSPEAKER_02:  Unfortunately, people's ability to save that money in advance just doesn't happen. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  I really love that you put the specifics of what public health and safety things are funded by this money because I'm not willing to lose those things. As a council member, I have bought. \nSPEAKER_02:  Alongside \nSPEAKER_02:  No. \nSPEAKER_02:  fought really hard myself but alongside council member uranga and now council lamens and theyhoss has joined the fight to really i mean \nSPEAKER_02:  are our language access program, our health equity. I mean we have so many programs that are funded by this money. Many know that we're projecting a deficit with salary raises. I don't want to burden the marijuana industry, but I also don't want to say no to it. \nSPEAKER_02:  two years from now giving I am the salary increases that they need to keep up with inflation. And so we're really in this tough position because $9 million is significant. \nSPEAKER_02:  and every decision we're making as a council kind of flows into that. And so I'm going to really have to think about that, but I really appreciate that you put that in there. I wish the page about what would be cut with simpler. \nSPEAKER_02:  not just a picture out of the book. \nSPEAKER_02:  I understand you had time restrictions, but \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean, what does that mean? If you eliminate the AA2 in health services, we fought for four years to get that funding. It started as like a 12.25. \nSPEAKER_02:  Then we had a point point five person. Now we finally have a full time person. What are the things they're working on that are going to fall through their cracks? Because we're already understaffed and under budgeted. \nSPEAKER_02:  I want to find a solution because I want to ensure that it's equitable. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I want to help these businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  But I want to do it in a way that is not detrimental to the community that we have worked so hard to build up. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman Allen, do you have comments? \nSPEAKER_02:  And by the way, great presentation and Councilman Allen, you're muted. \nSPEAKER_02:  But the presentation was fantastic. \nSPEAKER_02:  Just really great detail, really good flow. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, are you ready? Yes. All right. So one of the things that I, \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, you talked about not wanting to burden the marijuana industry, but I just I still have a hard time wrapping my head around. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's total is tax is a burden and it is unfair. So how do we maybe staff can help me understand this? Like how do we treat them differently than any other business? And you know, I come to this as a business person myself. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  talk about being unfair. I get it that we need to pay for all these things but \nSPEAKER_01:  If it's marijuana, what's next? I mean, at what point do we burden one industry? \nSPEAKER_01:  and not figure out how to fund these other programs. So I just, if someone could like help me, like what's the rationale? Like how do we as a city explain it to these industries that we're gonna attack she more than anybody else because what is that reason? \nSPEAKER_01:  Does it kidnap anyone? And if you can't answer that, that's fine. I just, I have a hard time wrapping my head around that. \nSPEAKER_01:  deuxi\u00e8me \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks, everyone. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll give a little bit of insight. In the beginning, we wanted to bring forward a marijuana \nSPEAKER_02:  ordinance and the public was having a hard time. I think the initial \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  way that the community was open to accepting it was \nSPEAKER_02:  It will pay for itself. There were a lot of fears around this. It'll be a significant increase in police costs. There's going to be a significant increase in, and we were hearing those things at the dius, and there'd be 70 people lined up for it, and 70 people lined up against it. And when we started talking about, look, they're going to bring in their own revenue to support. \nSPEAKER_02:  The things that happen in a city around public health because they did not do that. Merrill want I'm sorry tobacco did not do that alcohol and there are these unintended expenses on a city for those things. And so I think that part of that was we're a city who was taking a chance and it was. \nSPEAKER_02:  It went through three and four cycles for a decade of failing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  of not being able to get the support of the community and therefore the council. And so I think that one, it was, you're getting into an industry where you're getting a law. So similar to if you want to open, say, a Popeye's chicken. \nSPEAKER_02:  Popeye says if you pay this fee, additionally, we're going to make sure there's no other Popeyes around you. In similar way, we said as a city, there are only going to be 30 whatever marijuana dispensaries. You are going to have a piece of that locked market. And for that, we are going to charge you \nSPEAKER_02:  And that makeup of how we charge, I don't think we knew where to go. When I look at the per square foot and the ounces of this and the weight of the leaves and all \nSPEAKER_02:  Wow! As a business owner, I don't want to calculate all that stuff. That is a significant \nSPEAKER_02:  administrative burden on them on top of the financial burden. I mean, I see us looking at a way where we go forward in a way that \nSPEAKER_02:  simplifies the process. \nSPEAKER_02:  Rose receipts is a tough one because on top of Rose receipts they're still having the sales tax that they charge off to the customer. \nSPEAKER_02:  But I would see that if there could be a way that they could charge something to the customer on top of the fee separate. \nSPEAKER_02:  kind of like Councilman Allen is saying, like to charge them differently. \nSPEAKER_02:  I see the challenge, but I also know that we were talking about, and this was years ago, we're having the financial crisis. \nSPEAKER_02:  Maybe we need a grocery seats tax on services. \nSPEAKER_02:  because \nSPEAKER_02:  sales has a tax. But like you're you're accountant and you're a lawyer and all of these other things didn't contribute in the same way and have other expenses associated. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  But I don't think that that ended up being popular and \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  It kind of... \nSPEAKER_02:  When I say, I, I mean, I meant the community decided to go to a different direction, but the city of Los Angeles grows receipts everything. \nSPEAKER_02:  So to them. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a little bit different. We don't do that. So I hear you 100%. I think there's been an evolution of the acceptance of this industry in the last 10 years. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and I think that's where, you know, I'm coming in into \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, the next episode of this challenge, but \nSPEAKER_01:  you know when you're um \nSPEAKER_01:  I appreciate your example, but you know, as a franchisee, yeah, you are protected. You are truly protected, but we haven't locked down the market for these folks. We have a warranty. Let me just finish. So we haven't guaranteed them because the illicit market is so strong. And so we can't, you know, it's not, it's not fair to say that we've locked it down. We haven't. In fact, it's even gotten illicit market has gotten stronger. So it's so hard for these businesses because of the illicit market and the competition where as in another business, you wouldn't be happening. And it wouldn't matter. So this is, I think it's just unique. I definitely don't know the answers to councilwoman, but I'm just kind of venting some of my... \nSPEAKER_04:  We have. \nSPEAKER_01:  My I'm thoughts. Kit, could I kindly ask, can you bring up the recommendations? \nSPEAKER_01:  the recommendation page please. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'mune for that Jen. \nSPEAKER_01:  So \nSPEAKER_01:  Obviously, I like anything that we need to do for equity applicants. That's always \nSPEAKER_01:  This is a take at the page and with all the options on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  There are some lovely ideals score that allowed in receptions, lime and olive. All in all now can be Available fat and qualified. More\u5dde community can be rimmed. That's the vast majority community. That's the biggest propaganda story in the nation. People following them keep telling them it's something everybody is filigure loses good Cheese cuts right now. \nSPEAKER_01:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_02:  There are a bunch of equal signs. There we go. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  There we go. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think, I mean, one of the things that I am concerned is like, how do we stop? \nSPEAKER_01:  This, you know, obviously I'd love to lower the taxes as much as we can and I understand the significance to other programs. Could we look at an option like right now we have guaranteed. \nSPEAKER_01:  12 million I think is what it is. Yes, 12 million right now is already I believe committed to services. \nSPEAKER_01:  for for 23. So is there is there an option to look at anything over 12 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  and how does that go back? \nSPEAKER_01:  to \nSPEAKER_01:  the retailers because we, you know, because all we'll do if this goes up. \nSPEAKER_01:  to 14, 15, 16 million down the road. Then we're \nSPEAKER_01:  We're guaranteeing that money for other services. How do we cap is our probably way to cap it at this and then look at, you know, as this increases. And I'm assuming that this may increase. I guess you guys can answer that. How if that could go back to those retailers just as an option. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that's scenario 4. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we would adjust for CPI. So if the budget of the city increases, that 12 million would be slightly adjustable. But I agree with you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that understanding that. \nSPEAKER_02:  and how we support it and ensuring that they're getting an investment back. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  in their industry. \nSPEAKER_02:  in terms of support for eliminating the illicit market. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then I and then even even narrow five as well, I mean, it may as well just look at that because it's no there's no revenue loss. \nSPEAKER_01:  in that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  And then also, did you, when you were talking to the retailers staff, did they speak on their feeling? I mean, I was reading, \nSPEAKER_01:  cutting the cultivation tax to zero, which we can't do because my understanding is we don't want to do that because then if we have to raise it, but you know if we \nSPEAKER_01:  but lower that is without a significant priority for them. \nSPEAKER_01:  because it lowers the price through the supply chain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, that is correct. That is a sentiment that was expressed by a lot of the full three colors and cultivators that the biggest impact would come from a production and the cultivation facts. Because that would reduce essentially what they purchase in place in the price of the flower. \nSPEAKER_04:  They've reduced it throughout the pandemic. You know, they're all the supply chain. And then by the point that it gets that cannabis holds to the retailers, I think that's where the significant price drop can go, which can then, if that's a, with the price drop, it'll be a reuse of course, reduced price consumers. And then what they expressed with that this could then attract more consumers because now the prices are lower versus the high prices and like the compounding taxes and the regard to it, but that's how it's set up right now. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then um \nSPEAKER_01:  Is there a... \nSPEAKER_01:  any advantage to going to a percentage of gross cells on cultivation as opposed to \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh \nSPEAKER_01:  Just square foot. \nSPEAKER_04:  There is because right now the cultivation tax is an account for how it's set up right now is one of business prior to this is becoming license for a full Curve cultivator they are required to pay the tax upfront since it's based on the square footage of you know first work footage and not the grocery See so it doesn't have an advantage in that \nSPEAKER_04:  or think of it in the sense where this new cultivator is just starting out. They haven't grown any cannabis and get right out the gate. \nSPEAKER_04:  they are supposed to pay $1,000 in full deviation tax. And that is not guaranteed that they are going to become a successful bro. It could be that they pay this tax, they crop school bad, and then they're stuck with the bill later on. So \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then also can I ask you a question to for you? \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Did when you were talking to the businesses, did any of them at LRQ? \nSPEAKER_01:  because I know you have deferral as an option, but how did that come about? Did they say that this would be something that they're interested in? Or are they not interested in? Or is this just maybe something that you guys, like, where did that come from? \nSPEAKER_04:  So the businesses did not express any interest in the deferral. I thought were that more and more. So it wasn't brought up during our discussions. We did include it as a recommendation because we did see that the city and county of San Francisco, they did something where, for prior to the position of the tax, they actually suspended it for the past two years. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that's kind of one reason why we brought this forward to see it would be it would be slightly different for our city because we already have both the text. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I believe that's the reason why he even wanted to chime in. \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure, I can expand on that. And so yes, like Valencia was mentioning, that is... \nSPEAKER_05:  why but San Francisco was a little bit different and easier because they had they had just gotten their initiative passed and so \nSPEAKER_05:  they did not yet start implementing the tax and so they deferred implementation of the tax, which is a little easier to do without going back to a vote. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so we're in a little bit of a different position and that's where our kind of what we could see as feasible was the deferral. And I just did want to add on the idea of going to gross sales for cultivation. Like Blancy mentioned, it is more friendly to the businesses. I will say that there may be a chance we need to go back to a vote of the public in order to change the basis of the tax, but we would seek legal advice. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman Allen with all the things you've said, I'd like to amend my motion if you're agreeable to potentially amend your second. \nSPEAKER_02:  It is just the two of us. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'd like to... \nSPEAKER_02:  motion to receive and file the report. \nSPEAKER_02:  with the suggested changes to the presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  with the suggested amendment to scenarios with a recommendation from this committee to adopt \nSPEAKER_02:  a mixture of scenario 4 and 5. \nSPEAKER_02:  with some research on whether or not we could also, what it would look like and what percentage made sense to modify cultivation to a gross receipts as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  and to also look at how we can ensure that the $12 million is not \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  a set number, it can go up slightly as the cost go up because I want to still be able to ensure that we can give the raises to the people who have those jobs and they're not marketed out and then no one wants to positions. But then it would be \nSPEAKER_02:  hopefully grow significantly slower than the revenue. \nSPEAKER_02:  from \nSPEAKER_02:  marijuana would grow because we're going to add a additional and so on and so forth. So \nSPEAKER_02:  and I would like to do. \nSPEAKER_02:  the idea on the reduce adult use in medical cultivation and retail taxes for equity businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll start out with let's propose Cindy would you be comfortable with half? \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, yes, I would be, but can I just um, Councilman, so what were you seeing? So I, I just make sure I understand your motion. So I don't want us to, we have the 12 million right now allocated. So when you're talking about that, I don't want to go over that. Okay. So is that so I was a little, make sure that we're on the same. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hoje LIKE THIS WER \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  around the same. \nSPEAKER_02:  The 12 million is based on the current cost of everything as it is. So when you theoretically add additional businesses, \nSPEAKER_02:  That money would be greater, but I'm saying that since their equity, let's give them half price. Oh, sorry, half the burden. And so that 12 million will necessarily stay 12 million. It will be slightly more, which will account for our next rounds of labor negotiations and so on. So that the 12 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  We're a one-of-revenue has been growing at. \nSPEAKER_02:  three million a year. I'm not thinking we need to be at that rate, right? We need to come up with a way where the tax rate can be reduced and it will gradually be reduced over time. \nSPEAKER_02:  in alignment with the growth of the industry. \nSPEAKER_02:  to be able to support the projects and needs that. \nSPEAKER_02:  the community has already stated that they felt were \nSPEAKER_02:  appropriate, which the council is voted on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  But we're talking about small costs that would be the adjustments of one, two percent of a total amount, not... \nSPEAKER_02:  an entire industry staying at the same percentage. Am I making sense? I'm so, so this is crap. \nSPEAKER_02:  Maybe someone could say to me back what I'm saying, because I know I'm not sounding very clear. And then. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'd be on the same page. \nSPEAKER_05:  I \nSPEAKER_02:  make sure you try effi \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, it sounds like you're saying yes, you're looking at that 12 million baseline in scenario four. However, you do want to make room for the fact that there will be, you know, labor negotiations and staff will get, you know, regular increases that are normal course and you just want to make sure. Basically, your your baseline is more about what is being funded, the programmatic things that are being funded and that we will continue to fund those programmatic pieces. And that might grow slowly above 12 million, but not drastically. \nSPEAKER_02:  might \nSPEAKER_02:  and we don't want city staff coming in and throwing in more things. \nSPEAKER_02:  to bring so just what is maintained what's there slight adjustments can be made within reason with the approval of the budget oversight committee annually and whatever that is but the that the tax rate would go down like if the tax rate is 10 percent it would easily with the addition of three additional businesses go down and I read \nSPEAKER_05:  so simulator \nSPEAKER_05:  maintain what \nSPEAKER_02:  and maybe if the industry grows again like it grew last year, it'll go down to seven or six. And I recognize that there is a bottom out number for medical because that was approved by the taxpayers. So there is a potential that medical could \nSPEAKER_02:  take the full burden of the $12 million and adult use could eventually become a zero tax. It is physically, it is mathematically possible. It's unlikely because people are less likely to get those marrow the adult, I'm sorry, the medical cards anymore. \nSPEAKER_02:  at least in my research that I was talking to the owner in my district, but it's physically possible that you could get down to a zero rate. \nSPEAKER_02:  Do we want to set a bottom threshold councilman Allen of what it is and do we want to always say that equity is always half of whatever the city needs to get to the \nSPEAKER_01:  the $12 million? Yeah, I like that. So my only concern is that even if businesses come on and equity businesses come on, that we stay at that $12 million, we don't overspend that. And anything else extra I'd like to see is some way to go back. \nSPEAKER_01:  to redo things. \nSPEAKER_01:  overall retail taxes. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I think that that's demonstrated through, and I hope I can say this properly. In year one, every business will receive a reduction. \nSPEAKER_02:  Because... \nSPEAKER_02:  There'll be eight new businesses online at half tax and that will fill the gap of some of that 12 million already. So you're already going to be a business this year with our recommendation, who will get a reduction in taxes. \nSPEAKER_02:  And maybe we do it, Councilman Allen said that it has to be done in a rears. Maybe we do it as a... \nSPEAKER_02:  and you will check back. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, the business is as a proportion. \nSPEAKER_02: \u7ffb\u8ddf\u4e0d\u5230 \nSPEAKER_02:  What business wouldn't like taxes to be paid and then three months go by, the numbers get averaged out and you get a big check back. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. The great savings account option for them. I love it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, good work, Councilman Allen. I wouldn't have thought of any of these things without the good collaboration we had today. \nSPEAKER_02:  Staff, do you have any questions about the motion on the floor? \nSPEAKER_05:  I think we understand it. It sounds like maybe some of the specifics on how this actually gets implemented might need to be ironed out. I do want to also clarify though that even though there are eight equity businesses that will be coming online, it takes them a while to be a course. \nSPEAKER_05:  get started and actually start contributing to those revenues. I just want to put that out there. If we may not see it above the 12 million this year, but we could. And that's something we can definitely look at. \nSPEAKER_00:  Get started. \nSPEAKER_02:  Well, I know our budget team and they always underestimate revenue. So I imagine we will. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then, secondarily, I would say that this will encourage the currently successful marijuana businesses to take a business under their wing because the more they are successful, the less they will pay themselves in tax. It's a great incentive program. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then... \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  I love it. I would never come up with it on my own, but I love the scenarios. I love how you presented it. So now you'll revise that scenario screen to be our recommendation from the committee. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, with that, um... \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay? \nSPEAKER_02:  Roll, let's do a vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilwoman Allen? \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm an eye. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have unanimous vote from the committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. And I think that's our only item, so I think we're done. \nSPEAKER_02:  Awesome. Thank you Councilwoman. \nSPEAKER_00:  We do have to do. \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean, for a couple of months, I have a sleeping baby who made it through the meeting. Yeah, I've been very, very glad. \nSPEAKER_00:  General Public College. \nSPEAKER_00:  \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 Detroit \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0?"
