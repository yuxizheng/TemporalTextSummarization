        "transcript": "SPEAKER_10:  Number three. \nSPEAKER_10:  Item number three is the recommendation to receive and file a presentation on the City of Long Beach procurement and accounts payable process. And we have several members of the \nSPEAKER_10:  staff with us today to do the presentation. I believe two of them are \nSPEAKER_10:  I'll ask that you each introduce yourself as you speak. But I believe one of them is Sandy Sung Palmer, the deputy finance director, and another is Michelle Wilson, the director of purchasing agent. So welcome. And we appreciate your time in being with us today before the working with you as we talk about these things. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please proceed. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Good afternoon, commission members. Thank you for your work and interest in our procurement and accounts payable processes. My name is Sandy St. Palmer, I am the WD Finance Director for the city. And today I have brought with me Michelle Wilson, the city's purchasing agent, as well as Claudia Buenrostro, our accounting management officer. We also have Tara Mortensen, the city's business services bureau manager, and Ruby Creole Quincy, the city controller available to answer questions as needed and they are virtual. \nSPEAKER_08:  We have prepared a presentation for you that provides an overview of the city's standard procurement and accounts payable procedures and controls. And I will start off by providing just a bit of background before handing it off to our two main presenters. \nSPEAKER_08:  This is a difficult to read on the screen, but if you could bear with me, this is a diagram to just set the stage in terms of the city's structure and lines of authority. The city of Long Beach has 23 departments, 15 of which report to the city manager, which are shown in the box on this slide. \nSPEAKER_08:  The remaining eight departments report to the City Council in some cases via their own commissions. \nSPEAKER_08:  per the city charter, the city's standard procedures and controls apply to all city manager departments and non-city manager departments are encouraged to follow them as well. \nSPEAKER_08:  While non-city manager departments are not required to follow our procurement policies and best practices in general, we do provide them training, review, and consulting. However, compliance is to their discretion and they do not go through city manager review. \nSPEAKER_08:  Michelle will be explaining our standard procurement practices to you in just a bit. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then Claudia will tell you about our accounts payable or AP processes. These include vendor maintenance, invoices, and payments. And in this area, we do have one key policy that applies citywide, including CM departments and non-CM city manager departments. And Claudia will highlight that for you. \nSPEAKER_08:  All that said, harbor and water are largely separate because they have their own finance functions. Except for vendor maintenance, none of their procurement or accounts payable transactions flow through financial management. \nSPEAKER_08:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_08:  I apologize, I seem to be having a display issue with my next slide, but hopefully you may have a copy of it from a prior distribution. The pie chart, if you could allow me to sort of describe it, is a way to get a practical sense regarding how the city's lines of authority play out for our purchasing and accounts of the payable processes, which is to look at departmental expenditures via purchase order. \nSPEAKER_08:  The majority of our transactions that are purchases and then followed by payments are captured as spending against a purchase order. A purchase order being a written offer to a supplier stating the terms and conditions on which the city shall purchase goods or services. And that would include the types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. \nSPEAKER_08:  That's similar to a contract essentially and it is set up in our financial system units so that we can record spending against it. And while spending against purchase orders isn't the whole world of purchases and payments, it's a good practical benchmark. And so when we look at spending against purchase orders over the last two fiscal years, we find that city manager departments make up 53% of that spending. Harbor and Water with their own finance functions comprised 46%. And the remaining non-city manager departments taken together represent the remaining 1%. \nSPEAKER_08:  The city undergoes an annual financial audit each year, which is performed by audit firm KPMG and each year KPMG expresses an opinion on the effectiveness of our financial controls. \nSPEAKER_08:  We also have a couple additional independent financial audits every year from various regulatory agencies and audit firms, where our procedures and controls are examined and evaluated. \nSPEAKER_08:  We have a foundation of solid procedures and effective controls in place. And these are put in place via various administrative regulations, financial policies and procedures, operating procedures, training manuals, and functions of our financial system units. \nSPEAKER_08:  in the continuous effort of making our processes better. We evaluate the procedures and controls annually and improve any issues that we find. \nSPEAKER_08:  The City of Long Beach is a big organization and as a result is partly decentralized for procurement and accounts payable processes. So what that means is that tasks and responsibilities are divided between the departments, the operating departments and central financial management. Departments maintain a degree of autonomy and ownership over contracts and payments and we in financial management provide the department's tools, training and support to make good vendor selections, implement contract management best practices and meaningfully review invoices for payment. \nSPEAKER_08:  We provide that support for both city manager and non-city manager departments and treat them by and large the same. \nSPEAKER_08:  And with that, that will conclude my intro section. And I'll go ahead and pass you to Michelle Wilson, our purchasing agent who will present on the city's purchasing processes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello commissioners, nice to see you again, nice to see you in person this time. Thanks for having me back. You must have missed me because it's only been I think three months since I was here last. This first slide is one that we showed at our last presentation, but I think it's worth revisiting. This is a table of our various purchasing thresholds in the process and approval levels associated with each. As you can see, the procurement controls increase with the value of each purchase. We have the purchasing type, which is our micro purchases, our small purchases, and lastly our formal purchases. The micro purchases are from $1 to $2,500 and that has a approval level of the department director. We have small purchases which are $2,500 to $2,500,000 also with the department director approval level. The types of procurement methods that this would involve would be staff reimbursements, P card purchases, a purchase order with at least one quote and a vendor selection form, which I will actually show you a sample of that a little bit later. Then we have our small purchases, which are $2,500 to $2,500,000, which are a PO with at least three quotes on the vendor selection form. \nSPEAKER_06:  Lastly, we have our formal purchases, which is anything 25,000 and above. This has layers of approval, which includes city manager, and if it's above 200,000, and in some cases 100,000, it has city council approval. \nSPEAKER_06:  These are formal solicitations which include invitations to bid, request for proposals and request for qualifications. It also includes cooperative procurement, emergency procurement, exceptions to policy and sole source. \nSPEAKER_06:  The next slide will give you a bit more detail about our micropr- I mean our small dollar purchases, which is anything less than 25,000. Although this is considered an informal process, it is a documented one. \nSPEAKER_06:  For these purchases, Department staff requests quotes from a minimum of three vendors, which can be either in writing, by email an internet search or over the phone or in person. Staff now can also use the new Long Beach Buies procurement software system to obtain quotes under 25,000. \nSPEAKER_06:  Quotes are reviewed through the departmental chain of command to ensure that staff have done their due diligence when selecting a vendor. And ultimately, the department head is responsible for the process being in place and compliance being met. \nSPEAKER_06:  All quotes must be for like items within the same fiscal year. Staff are also encouraged to be looking at local vendors to obtain quotes. \nSPEAKER_06:  The next threshold is our formal procurements, which are all purchases above 25,000. These require competitive solicitation or an approved exception to policy. \nSPEAKER_06:  Purchasing reviews all purchases over 25,000 and verifies that they have the compliant selection process was followed. \nSPEAKER_06:  Competitive solicitation process begins with the requisition phase. This is where the department identifies that the procurement requires a competitive solicitation process and initiates the drafting and solicitation documents and enters it into Long Beach Bies, which is our new procurement software. \nSPEAKER_06:  purchasing then reviews all purchases over 25,000 and verifies the selection process. The competitive solicitation process includes traditional best practices as well as additional city of Long Beach specific controls, including reviews and approvals of the solicitation document by central purchasing, the city attorney and risk management. \nSPEAKER_06:  Then this is followed by the solicitation phase, which is where the solicitation document is reviewed and approved through purchasing the city attorney and risk management. All types are posted publicly through a consistent and transparent process. \nSPEAKER_06:  Procurements are advertised by email to the community and business organizations as well as in print and on social media. \nSPEAKER_06:  All communication is channeled through the assigned buyer in the purchasing division of financial management. The department does not have access to the proposals and all proposals are kept confidential until all submittals are received. Questions and answers are made public to all prospective proposals at the same time before proposals or bids or do. Bidders also attest that there is no conflict of interest. The exact verbages here on the slide if you'd like to read. After the bid or the RFP closed date, we have the evaluation and the award phase. \nSPEAKER_06:  For invitations to bid, awards go to the lowest responsible bidder. For requests for proposals, evaluation is based on published evaluation criteria awarded by a committee which has a minimum of three members. All committee members sign conflict of interest disclosure forms and all members are disclosed to central purchasing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Award decision is reviewed by department. \nSPEAKER_06:  and by purchasing. \nSPEAKER_06:  The Notice of Intent to Award is then publicly posted with all of our protest procedures included. \nSPEAKER_06:  Lastly, we have the approval and contracting phase. This has multiple layers of approval from the department to purchasing in the city manager of over 25,000. The city attorney if over 95,000 and city council if over 200,000 or could be 100,000 if there are less than three responses received and or and or a protest was submitted to the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  Purchasing verifies all applicable forms, and with an RFP, a proformal agreement is signed by the vendor to reaffirm all terms and conditions, and in a bid, the vendor executes the bid agreement and reaffirms all of the terms and conditions. Finally, awards are public information posted within the bidding software system. \nSPEAKER_06:  Final awards, more than 200,000 are approved by City Council, which allow for public comment and are also noticed publicly. \nSPEAKER_06:  The last section I will present on is our exceptions to policy. All exceptions to policy are required to have documented justification and to have that available in the citywide financial system. Each one is reviewed at each threshold that you can see on the table on this slide. If it's less than or equal to 25,000, it is the department director approval. If it is greater than 25,000 but less than or equal to 100,000, we have the department director purchasing and the city manager. \nSPEAKER_06:  If it is over 100,000, we have the Department Director purchasing City Manager, the City Attorney, as well as City Council. \nSPEAKER_06:  All purchase order documents over 25,000 are reviewed independently by the Central Purchasing Division and the backup for all exceptions are reviewed and approved. \nSPEAKER_06:  Lastly, I just want to show you a sample of our vendor selection form, which I referenced at the beginning of my part of this presentation, and to show you a few of the key fields that are in the form. We have the vendor information, the procurement process, the dollar amount, and other information listed at the front. We have the description of the purchase, and then we have quotes that are attached. We also have a justification for any request for exception to policy and a line for the department had approval for all exceptions. \nSPEAKER_06:  That concludes my portion and I will now pass it on to Claudia. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm chair-wise, do you wanna hold all questions till the end of all three? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I think we will. \nSPEAKER_10:  will at this point. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please proceed. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hello commission members, my name is Claude Brun-Rostra and I'm the accounting management officer and I will be speaking to you about our city's accounts payable and payment process. \nSPEAKER_07:  As Cindy mentioned at the beginning of the presentation, among the city's many policies and procedures that are established, there are some financial policies and procedures that apply citywide to all city manager and non-city manager departments, even to harbor and to water. These relate to vendor maintenance, which I understand is an area that the commission has expressed interest in. Therefore, I want to make that I want to take this opportunity to highlight these procedures which are provided to you with this presentation. \nSPEAKER_07:  When a department needs a vendor to be added to Munis or to the vendor needs to be updated, departments send the vendor ad form, W9 form when applicable and any other supporting documentation to the FM vendor email. \nSPEAKER_07:  To ensure segregation of duties, only FM can create and update vendors upon department requests, review of supporting documentation and validation or vendor identity. \nSPEAKER_07:  In this table, you will see the cities for vendor types and a short description of each. \nSPEAKER_07:  of apologies. Please note that the W9 form requirement will depend on vendor and transaction type. \nSPEAKER_07:  The next two slides summarize the share procedural tasks for vendor addition and update and the controls in place at each step. Our share responsibilities ensure that there is adequate and independent review of the transaction. Financial management completes their due diligence by confirming the vendor identity with the IRS database, as well as the vendor's good standing with the federal government and SAM.gov website. This process allows the city to do business with reputable and vetted vendors. Within FAM, there is a layer review from different personnel. After confirming the vendor details, the AP Technician enters the information into Munis and the record is then routed to the Accounting Management Officer for review, which is me. \nSPEAKER_07:  I confirm that the required documents are attached, that the vendor has been identified in IRS and Sam.gov without any issues, and that the information on the W9 form and vendor ad form matches what has been entered into Minus. If all information is accurate, I approve the vendor record and it will become active. \nSPEAKER_07:  In instances where a vendor wants to change their payment type from check to electronic fund transfer or EFT, the EFT form is completed with the bank account information and sent to FM vendor email. The AP Technician independently validates the request and information with the vendor before entering it into Munis. The information is entered by the AP Technician and reviewed by the Accounting Management Officer. As another layer of validation, the first payment after EFT setup has a pre-note which the bank validates to ensure the information is accurate. Finally, during the annual financial audit and single audit due to federal requirements, the external auditors KPMG review the city's procedures and perform testing on selected transactions by requesting documentation from the city. These documents support vendor additions and the city's confirmation at vendors good standing. Any discrepancies or findings would be communicated. As of recent year audits, none have been noted. \nSPEAKER_07:  Moving on to vendor invoices, the city currently has a decentralized AP process with multiple layers of review and approval. This gives the departments the lead role in processing their invoices upon confirming that the goods and services were delivered. This table shows the layers of review and approval required for each payment type. To ensure invoiced payment is authorized, at least one approval from the department must be a manager level or above. For wired transactions, the department must fill out a wire package, which is additionally routed to the city auditor for approval. \nSPEAKER_07:  Please note that prior to printing checks, there is one last high-level review of AP invoices by the City Auditor. Even though they are not included in the approval workflow, this bot check review has sometimes identified additional information needed from departments prior to finalizing payment. \nSPEAKER_07:  The next two slides summarize the invoice and payment process. To ensure separation of duties, the department initiates invoice entry and at least one department manager must approve, like mentioned before. \nSPEAKER_07:  It is then routed to FM4 review and approval by various accounting personnel. \nSPEAKER_07:  FN personnel review the AP record against the invoice attachment and match the invoice and vendor details, dollar amounts, and GL accounts amongst other fields to ensure accuracy. If not, the scrapesies are found. FN pose the invoice batches, which are routed via munis to the city auditor for check run. \nSPEAKER_07:  Chicks are printed daily by City Auditor and electronically signed by the City Auditor and the City Treasurer. Currently, an absence of the City Treasurer, the Director of Financial Management is back feeling and electronically signing the checks. \nSPEAKER_07:  Once the checks are printed, they are delivered for the mail room for mailing out. \nSPEAKER_07:  Similar to the vendor testing performed by KPMG, the auditors also review the city's AP procedures earned performed testing on selected invoice payment transactions to review the supporting documentation. Again, as of recent years, none have been noted. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for attention and this concludes my presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  I will take just a moment to wrap us up. You have heard today an overview of our standard procedures and controls for both purchasing and accounts payable. \nSPEAKER_08:  Despite the city's size and complexity, multiple independent financial auditors over multiple years have not reported any material misstatements or instances of deficiencies in our internal controls in the city's procurement and accounts payable financial activities, including in our most recently completed financial audit. \nSPEAKER_08:  We provide tools to departments to support them in their responsibilities and have good participation from non-city manager departments beyond the scope of our authority is established by the city charter. We continue to review our operations and look for opportunities to improve our procedures and controls. We thank you for your interest and the opportunity to present to you today. We hope this information is helpful and we welcome your questions and we have both our presenters available as well as city controller Ruby Creo Quincy and Business Services Manager Tara Mortensen virtually to answer questions and this concludes our report. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think that commissioners do have questions. I know that I have have questions and I get the impression that Commissioner Pollock has questions. So I'll let Commissioner Pollock begin. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  First, just a background question in the introduction where city manager accounted for 53% of total spend on purchase orders. I want to make sure does purchase orders encompass everything including construction contracts, port, railway, things, etc. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, in the port wouldn't be in the 53 percent, but Harbor was in the 100 percent. \nSPEAKER_08:  So not all of our spend is captured against purchase orders, but a large majority of it is. That would include construction contracts and other expenses. So it's not a completely all-encompassing measure, but it's a good and easily referenceable measure. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  Let me interrupt for a second. I have a related question on this pie chart thing. So it includes all the capital projects that the port is doing. \nSPEAKER_08:  The 100% includes all departments. I cannot say for certain if every single capital project is included within this. This is one representative slice of our spending. It would include projects, but I cannot assure you that it includes every single capital project because there are multiple ways to make payments within the system. But this is an easy statistic to quickly bring up and references just a point of scale. And isn't meant to be representative of the city's entire spend. But more so just to talk about scale between the various lines of authorities of city manager departments and non-city manager departments. So I would caution you to look to this as some sort of specific measure of those departments spending. But more so just an indication of scale between the various categories of harbor and water versus city manager departments versus other non-city manager departments. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, is it possible to get a specific? \nSPEAKER_08:  That number to reach it is very difficult because of the various ways that we categorize expenses. So to get to what is truly procurement and AP separate from other transactions that are payments, but not along the lines of what I believe is the interest of this commission would be a difficult number to get to. Which is why we utilize this just to give you a perspective. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, but what are you considering the other category? \nSPEAKER_08:  Other examples of payments would be we do have situations in which payments are made directly against a contract in the financial system. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  where a purchase order has not been separately set up. It is possible on a technical level to make payments against the contract and that is acceptable procedurally as well. And so that would not be captured here. Also direct payments would not be captured here. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  So maybe our interest was not fully communicated to you because contracts were an area that we were interested in. \nSPEAKER_08:  Absolutely, and all of our procedures spoke to contracts that we shared with you today. That slide was not intended to capture the entire universe, but more so just to speak to scale. \nSPEAKER_08:  to give an indication of scale. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as you know, we were looking at contracts and accounts payable in the context of our review of a report regarding the city auditors spending on Kagan, Gagan, and another group. Would those payments be included in this pie chart? \nSPEAKER_08:  they would not as they were direct payments. \nSPEAKER_08:  And what we do speak to those procedures generally throughout the presentation that was provided by Michelle and Claudiet and we are available to answer any questions about that and I apologize for any confusion But that slide that we included with the pie chart was really not meant to capture all spend as I wasn't aware that you were looking for specific dollar breakdowns But more just so to speak to when you're thinking about the scale of the various operations Some sort of benchmark to conceptualize that was quick for us to grab and provide to you for the presentation \nSPEAKER_08:  We absolutely understand that your interest includes those other payment methods and are here to speak to those procedures and provide you any information that you need. \nSPEAKER_00:  the AP process that was presented to us. \nSPEAKER_00:  does cover the payments that would be made in those kinds of \nSPEAKER_00:  relationships. \nSPEAKER_08:  Correct, portions of Claudia's presentation specifically was speaking to those payment methods. And we can provide you any detailed answers that you may need related to those processes. \nSPEAKER_00:  So we were told. \nSPEAKER_00:  that all of the city council members and I think most of the non-city manager departments other than water and harbor said they are following the city manager processes for procurement. \nSPEAKER_00:  So how does that translate, for example, when a department, if you have a city council member, who's the department head that has to approve an invoice? \nSPEAKER_00:  They don't, where you have multiple reviews at multiple layers, I don't think the City Council offices are really organized that way. \nSPEAKER_08:  The city councils organized to provide a purchasing review through the mayor's office. \nSPEAKER_08:  So while that, I understand your point about their organization, they have a procedure that they have established where those documents are routed through the mayor's office for administrative review. \nSPEAKER_09:  for the mayor review some more his staff. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  We're trying to get down, we're really nitty gritty people. Absolutely. So if say Council District 1 wants to do a procurement, it's not Councilwoman Zendaihoss, it signs office, the department head, it has to go through the mayor's office and then do you know who does the review in the mayor's office? \nSPEAKER_08:  trying to get \nSPEAKER_08:  Let me air stuff \nSPEAKER_07:  We don't have like a specific person or an apple, we can definitely look into the various heads, department heads that would look into those details and get back to you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  So if you don't have that knowledge, how do you know it's been appropriately approved? \nSPEAKER_09:  We have 9 videos coming in now until Number 26K right here. \nSPEAKER_08:  have approved signers. \nSPEAKER_08:  First of all, for the sake of City Council, their scale of procurements tend to be very small dollar procurements. And so those when they are going through their processes, they typically get quotes. As Michelle mentioned, it'll hand it over to her for any specifics. Those are the department discretion. And so those would be approved administratively through their processes organized through the mayor's office staff. \nSPEAKER_08:  Michelle, do you have any additional information you'd like to add? \nSPEAKER_06:  No, that's accurate. Terra may also have something to add. She's on virtually. \nSPEAKER_02:  Good afternoon. This is Harry Morensen. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, so the mayor's office is ultimately responsible to approve those transactions and the mayor himself has \nSPEAKER_02:  makes the decision as to who within his staff is going to be delegated. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's an authority that would be delegated from the mayor to his staff. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so that would be a decision the mayor would make. \nSPEAKER_00:  So when the invoice hits the AP department, what is AP looking for? Like on where we have on pages 19, the payment process summary. \nSPEAKER_00:  How does that process engage if it's a city council member or the city clerk or the city auditor or the city attorney non-city manager departments? \nSPEAKER_07:  So we have VIPCCs which are vendor invoys certification cards that we keep on the internet. And it lists the members that are authorized to approve those invoices. And those VIPCC cards are signed by the head of the departments. And each time that someone in central FM gets those invoices, they check against those VIPCC cards to make sure that there was a signature against those cards and they have sufficient authorization to approve the invoices. \nSPEAKER_00:  essentially the person in the department signed the invoice that's the end of it. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that, and when KPMG or whoever the outside audit firm is, they come in to audit all they're looking for is that there's a signature on the invoice that is on a BIPCC. \nSPEAKER_07:  I believe they're also looking for to make sure that there's sufficient documentation to support the expense as a business expenditure to make sure that there's in an addition to the approvals that there was a purchase order for example if it's within a certain amount or if there's a contract. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think they look around all of those materials in addition just to the signatures. \nSPEAKER_00:  and are there electronic signatures? \nSPEAKER_07:  No, we actually require a wet signature or an email stating that in addition to these invoices are approved by, you know, so and so. So it's either wet signature when possible if not an email form. \nSPEAKER_00:  One last question. I had asked about the Hawkins contract before this meeting, and Hullian provided me generally with the response, but I still didn't understand why the vendor was not in the contract's online database. \nSPEAKER_00:  What vendors get into the contract is the contracts online only city manager contracts \nSPEAKER_06:  when you're saying the contract's on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks for having me. Sorry, Michelle. \nSPEAKER_02:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Good afternoon. This is Tara. Yes. So the contract that get into the contract online. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh, database are contracts that are actually informed and signed. So like a regular paper contract would be in the, um, the database. And in this situation, because the dollar amount, \nSPEAKER_02:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_02:  had the threshold, it was under the 100,000. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  threshold the appropriate way to go ahead and contract for this specific service was through a purchase order. So a purchase order wouldn't be in the online database. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this is Taylor just to clarify, there are really two types of contracts that the city operates with. The purchase order is the one that FM really deals with the most. And then there's another category of contracts that typically require city council approval. They're typically drafted by my office or they're coming from an outside vendor or consultant. They have to be reviewed and approved by my office and signed by the city manager. The purchase orders have a lower threshold. \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe it's under $100,000. Those happen typically electronically. They do have terms and conditions that have been approved by the City Council and signed off by my office, but it's more of a transactional document, as opposed to \nSPEAKER_03:  If we were doing a capital improvement project, that would be something that would be what Tara is referring to as a paper contract. Something that's drafted by my office, there are a lot of terms and conditions that are outlined for the project. There's a scope of work. \nSPEAKER_03:  They're a little bit more labor intensive when they come through my office versus the purchase order, which is usually it's a standard terms and conditions. Sometimes there's a scope of work. It's typically very limited. \nSPEAKER_00:  and which category goes into contracts online. \nSPEAKER_03:  Typically, the ones that come through my office. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  the ones that are paper contracts that are signed and reviewed by the city manager. Typically not and correct me if I'm wrong purchasing team not the purchase orders that are under 100,000. \nSPEAKER_02:  Correct purchase orders under 100,000 would not be included. The contracts online database is created from the conformed contracts that are filed with the city clerk's office. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Wie finde ich? \nSPEAKER_10:  Do other commissioners have comments or questions? \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Chatt will. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I just have a couple clarifying questions. So referring to... \nSPEAKER_01:  Page two of your presentation. So you hear you say procedures, as you mentioned, procedures and controls applied to the city manager departments and the non-city manager departments are encouraged to follow them. However, the policy that accounts payable policy applies citywide. Is that because all the city departments report up to the city council and the mayor or the mayor? I was just wondering, it was my understanding that policies did not apply citywide. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think really the question is and I think we all have it, is on the W-9 process that applies across the city irrespective of who it is. How come that one can apply to all departments when we've been told that there are policies, personnel, contract and fiscal that only apply to city manager departments and other departments can have their own policy. They may be in line. But we're wondering how this one policy can apply citywide when we're told really nothing else does. \nSPEAKER_09:  And you may not know the answer to that question, which is OK. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think we would. \nSPEAKER_08:  not have that answer available today unless the City Attorney's Office has a comment, but we may have to get back to you on that one. \nSPEAKER_08:  here. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner, is that something that we'll need to look into and get back to you? I don't think anybody is in a position to answer that specific of a question today. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, thank you, thank you, Taylor. \nSPEAKER_01:  The other \nSPEAKER_01:  a couple of questions I have. I think and this is following up on what Commissioner Pollock can ask about. I'm trying to get a Rough sense and I think you've addressed it, but I don't know if I got it down correctly. To what extent do the other departments primarily water and harbor? Do they follow the processes that have been recommended to them by the city managers? By your office and that have been recommended? They've applied to the city manager departments and been recommended to the non-city manager departments. \nSPEAKER_08:  We do not have visibility to harbor and water because their work does not work flow through us. So as I understand it, they have stated that they do follow those processes. So I assume they have similar controls and procedures on their side based on that assertion. For the remaining departments, non-city manager departments, we generally see compliance with our procedures. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, and so with this harbor and this and the water departments, but they have provided the representations that they do. \nSPEAKER_01:  You just don't let you cannot verify it. \nSPEAKER_08:  I believe that they did. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just wanted to add... \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  that the Harbor Department and the Water Department have adopted their own procurement policies that are generally in line, but they have official policies themselves and they're quite extensive and from. \nSPEAKER_02:  my review and interaction with them in the past, they're definitely quite extensive and comprehensive. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner's sister's Taylor also if it would. \nSPEAKER_03:  Be in your interest. We can also speak to those departments to have them come and give separate presentations if that's something that you're interested in because the staff before you today is not going to be able to answer those questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Taylor. And so the question is. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you up. \nSPEAKER_10:  Mr. Deban, did you have questions? \nSPEAKER_11:  I do, I do. \nSPEAKER_11:  First of all, thank you, Claudia Michelle, and I apologize I lost the last name. Appreciate the hard work you do. \nSPEAKER_11:  I have to say from a best practice point of view, being highly decentralized can create a lot of difficulties. I know that usually it's a resource issue. \nSPEAKER_11:  bottom line. And I'm curious about, I have various questions. How long has KPMG been your primary auditor when coming in on your annual reports? Just curious. \nSPEAKER_12:  Good afternoon. My name is Priya Prensy. I'm the city controller. KPI and J has been auditing the city for at least 20 years. \nSPEAKER_11:  V \nSPEAKER_12:  The city auditor oversees the agreement and I know they have been they receive renewals over over that period of time \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay, extensions of the new contract. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  All right, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about consulting agreements. Are they part, are they handled by POs or are they under that contract umbrella? \nSPEAKER_06:  Typically they fall under the $100,000 threshold, so they're within the PO. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  very interesting. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. I noticed your suspension and debarment screening that you do some checking. \nSPEAKER_11:  Because it's so decentralized, one of the things I don't know if it's appropriate now to make a recommendation or not, but having only a bidder at a station, there's lots to be gained by the whole procurement, the whole supply chain, whether it be the requester. Because it's so decentralized that they too are attesting to no conflict of interest, the bidder, even your team, you know, everybody has to be without conflict of interest. And I would also recommend that the language in that attestation is kind of broad. It really could be tightened down to go beyond what it says there about spousal and financial only. Because I think conflict of interest in the supply chain can be much broader than what's described there. \nSPEAKER_11:  The other question I had is on P cards. How are, what's the volume of P cards? Are they all part of their process also? \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  P-CAR compliance does. \nSPEAKER_06:  fall within the purchasing, central purchasing division. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, and so I guess I'm curious about testing. \nSPEAKER_11:  The vendor list that's provided to you all, to what extent is there any testing along those lines, or it seems to me that the requester is also selecting the potential bitters. And then \nSPEAKER_11:  Are there ever occasions where you? \nSPEAKER_11:  You don't accept those. Tell me a little bit about the vetting process on your side. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you ask that again? I'm sorry. So you're off the P card question, right? \nSPEAKER_11:  you're off the peak. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm sorry, you're not talking about it. \nSPEAKER_11:  about with P-cards. \nSPEAKER_11:  No, no, no, I'm not. I apologize for switching on you. I'm just trying to cover all the things that I'm going to do faster. I'm going to move faster. Yeah, I'm, sometimes I'm dangerous. Okay. The vendor listing, you have three potentials that come in, and it's my sense that the requester provides those. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm just ready. \nSPEAKER_06:  Time to fast. \nSPEAKER_11:  The quotes, right? Correct. Yes, right? They select the vendor. They also get the quote and then what is the testing level on your side? \nSPEAKER_11:  in the down select of those three, or is there any, what's the process there? \nSPEAKER_06:  That's the department, so the department would be the one obtaining the quotes and then selecting from there. And that's when it's under 25,000. So those purchases are with the department. So it's not until it goes into a formal solicitation after 25,000 when it hits central purchasing and when we get involved in the approval levels. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I doubt you probably have time if this is, you know, I don't know how big the staff is. Any self-testing or self-assessments on your side. \nSPEAKER_11:  on the work that you all do. For the under 25,000? Just a general on your work product and... \nSPEAKER_00:  Just a general. \nSPEAKER_11:  that's the organization, do any. \nSPEAKER_11:  testing or any contract compliance of your procurements. \nSPEAKER_06:  organization means do we have an auditor that comes in? \nSPEAKER_11:  to do another thing. I'm aware within your own group that \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I mean, there's definitely layers of approval. They kind of have a check imbalance with it. Tara may have some better insight or words to share with you than me on this. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let me help. \nSPEAKER_06:  because \nSPEAKER_02:  Certainly the um \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry, certainly the within the scope of the purchasing agent is all procurement and it's within the role to go ahead and do self assessment and self testing as we find \nSPEAKER_02:  red flags and items to go and look at at this point. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have done that periodically. There isn't the resources to do a consistent and. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, a consistent approach, which is when I think you're asking about. \nSPEAKER_09:  Are you asking on a contract if they go out and make sure that the contract is doing what needs to be done? \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  or \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm curious about that but I just understanding the intake. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  because I think they do, I understand their process. I think they're very thorough. They're doing per policy. \nSPEAKER_11:  It's really raising that bar on the front end and that's the decentralized approach. It creates a lot of room for me in terms of conflict of interest. And that's my chief comment. \nSPEAKER_09:  So you're really looking to see what they're doing to make sure that whomever the procurement officer is. \nSPEAKER_09:  does not have a conflict with anything that they've recommended going forward. The requester. \nSPEAKER_09:  I don't know what language is. So basically, do you ever take a sampling? \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  of the work that a procurement officer has done. \nSPEAKER_09:  and look at that against because they have to file the form 700 also, right? \nSPEAKER_09:  So, does anyone in the city ever look at that to make sure that there's no conflict? \nSPEAKER_09:  within the work that they're doing and what they're doing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can I ask a clarifying question? Because I think I know what you guys are trying to get at. Are you asking if this team is going to be a good team? \nSPEAKER_03:  because it's managed at the department level. \nSPEAKER_03:  does spot audits of what the departments are doing. \nSPEAKER_09:  Where are you going? \nSPEAKER_09:  departments too. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah, I'm interested in that. I find that it's a, and I don't have an understanding of how the city operates, obviously. But in terms of having it so decentralized, there isn't a lot of independent thinking in terms of the, at the requester level. They choose who they wanna submit to the, the three, let's say, to the form. And I'm wondering about the vetting process even at that level and even at the requester, to be sure that they're free of conflict of interest before it even arrives or the forms are submitted. It, I think that there's some room to raise the bar, education, and I don't have the benefit of knowing what goes into being a requester or a procure, and what kind of training they receive at their department level. So if there's anything you can offer. I think, yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I think what you're trying to ask is whether or not there's oversight by maybe this team or any other team. \nSPEAKER_03:  on the individual purchasers within the department. \nSPEAKER_03:  to make sure that there's no conflict. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Friends, can you answer that question? \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry Taylor, can you repeat that? \nSPEAKER_03:  So what they're trying to get at is whether your team or there's any other oversight for the purchasers in the individual departments. \nSPEAKER_03:  And whether or not there is any oversight for conflicts of interest between the people \nSPEAKER_03:  The purchasers in the departments. \nSPEAKER_03:  that are buyers that are purchasing within the departments. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  conflicts between the vendors that they're selecting. \nSPEAKER_03:  So what they're concerned about is \nSPEAKER_03:  You guys are central purchasing, but really each of the departments is fairly autonomous with some oversight from you guys and how they manage purchasing. So they're looking to see if there's any mechanism that's catching conflicts of interest. \nSPEAKER_03:  between purchasers at the department level. \nSPEAKER_03:  and vendors. \nSPEAKER_11:  even trained. \nSPEAKER_02:  I appreciate that. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  for these specific low dollar purchases. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  the department themselves so the requester is completing the form and then it is the responsibility of the department to go ahead and evaluate. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  and determine if that is an appropriate sample, if that is appropriate. At \nSPEAKER_02:  At this level and the granularity of those smaller purchases, the department is really best position to be able to understand what the marketplace may be for that purchase, whether the purchase price makes a bunch of sense. So it makes sense for the director to \nSPEAKER_02:  for each of the specific departments because every department is so different. It makes sense for the director to go ahead and appoint those within the organization that are going to review those and determine whether that is the appropriate purchase for these much smaller purchases. Anything over $25,000 is going to be reviewed by purchasing and that is really the bulk of the spend within the city is at the larger dollar amounts. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Ah, that's good. \nSPEAKER_02:  And it is pretty um \nSPEAKER_02:  consistent with other city organizations to have this threshold kind of a situation. \nSPEAKER_02:  whether it's considered best practice. I don't know if I should refer to it as that or just that. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's very standard within the government procurement field to go ahead and have a threshold situation where the smaller and less frisky purchases are approved at a lower threshold and then here in the city of Long Beach we actually have a \nSPEAKER_02:  a very conservative threshold at 25,000 for requiring competition. \nSPEAKER_02:  and um \nSPEAKER_02:  completing the competitive solicitations at that level. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think then Tara, could you share if your team knows? So it sounds like the department directors are directly responsible for auditing the contracts of their staff and whether there's a conflict. Is there any particular role that the auditor's office plays? \nSPEAKER_03:  or where they would intervene. \nSPEAKER_02:  where they would intervene. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So \nSPEAKER_02:  My understanding of this and I may ask Ruby to go ahead and comment as well. So the auditor's office is in \nSPEAKER_02:  on the front side of review or seeing it. \nSPEAKER_02:  But whenever a payment is made, the auditor's office does review the payments and this is where I would appreciate it if Ruby could comment on the auditor's office review of payments. And then also of course the auditor's office has the \nSPEAKER_02:  has the ability to commission an audit on \nSPEAKER_02:  anything that they are \nSPEAKER_02:  either concerned with. \nSPEAKER_02:  or have been alerted through their fraud hotline. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you, Tara. So yes, just confirming that the City Auditors Office does perform spot checking. They are not in the actual financial system approval workflow process. \nSPEAKER_12:  But they do get to see the badge of all vendor voices that are going to be paid on that particular check run. \nSPEAKER_12:  and they will check and they will follow up with departments if they are in need of additional documentation. \nSPEAKER_12:  or they need more information. \nSPEAKER_10:  Are you finished, Commissioner? \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  I think it does. Yeah. Okay. First, and again, thank you all. I appreciate what you're doing. I see where it fits. But I do, you know, I do want to challenge and raise the bar a little bit on some of the practices, the attestation and the whole supply chain. So your presentation was helpful today for us. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  \ub0a0\uc528\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_10:  You're just green as that. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, I want to ask a couple questions before I, please. Let others ask questions if no one, if everyone else is done. \nSPEAKER_10:  Ann-nya. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm this is going to be sort of all over the place because I'm trying to not ask questions that have already been asked so forgive me for that. But for example on page 18 of the slides you talk about the payment process and you say receiving department confirms that good services were satisfactorily received. So is there guidelines as to who in the department can provide that confirmation? \nSPEAKER_07:  So I kind of like going back to that, the VIPCC card. So that authorizer, whoever in the department, you know, has assigned to be the authorizer. And it has to be at least a manager level or above. We'll say this, I know that I've seen email grids says this invoice is approved for payments. So they would be the ones actually testifying that either the goods or the services have been received satisfactorily. \nSPEAKER_10:  So does the department decide who is going to do that? Or? \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, like I think it's based on the staff level. So like I mentioned, so at least there's at least a manager. So they would be included in that. \nSPEAKER_07:  VIPCC authorization cards and then anyone else that the department had teams reasonable that they should be added into that VIPCC card. \nSPEAKER_08:  and just to clarify it please review your Claudia, crack me if I'm wrong, all of those approvers are signed off by the department heads. \nSPEAKER_08:  That is correct. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, if I if I could piggyback on that for once quick second chair \nSPEAKER_09:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_09:  So. \nSPEAKER_09:  Is the person that's acknowledging that the services were received separate from somebody who is a buyer? \nSPEAKER_09:  and separate from somebody in \nSPEAKER_09:  I mean, and let me explain where I'm coming from, because I worked in government for years. \nSPEAKER_09:  So in our system, we had the buyer who would receive the PO from \nSPEAKER_09:  a staff person saying what it was they needed. \nSPEAKER_09:  They go into the list of approved vendors, pick the vendor that could make provided at the best price, send that off. The item or the service would be delivered to an office. Somebody there who had approval authority would indicate if it was received and then it would not go back through the purchasing department. It would go to the finance department to be signed off. They would make sure all the appropriate paperwork was there. There was a PO there and then it would go into the system for payment. \nSPEAKER_09:  Is what you're doing something similar to that or is the person that's doing the buying also the one that's doing the approving that it was received? \nSPEAKER_07:  No, I believe that at every single department there's several layers of personal responsible for various tasks, task, for example, there's an admin analyst that would be in charge of actually entering the requisition and doing all that. There's another person that's actually processing the invoices for approval. And then yet there's that third layer who's actually doing the approving and ensuring that everything else beforehand is actually authorized to go ahead and move on with the authorization of payment. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so my question is, is there something? I can't, I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm sorry, but I can just add for another little tidbit of details or technology and innovation department overseas. The the user setups and the permissions granted in our municipal financial system. And so when they're setting up a user, they look at those that have access to purchasing have access to accounts payable. \nSPEAKER_12:  And in many cases when they're seen \nSPEAKER_12:  possibly someone in both areas, then they have another layer. \nSPEAKER_12:  approval that they request the department to insert in that workflow just to ensure \nSPEAKER_12:  that we have separation and we have checks and balances even within the department. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. I'm not sure I got everything that you said, but you told me that there was some system in place that you thought did provide this. And I guess my question is, is there, is this a policy of the city that there will be this, is it written down somewhere and that's the policy that we're looking to follow, that there will be a separation between the person that buys this stuff and the person that says, yes, in fact, we received this stuff. \nSPEAKER_10:  So the person that buys this stuff couldn't just be funneling. I'm just, I'm being theoretical here, but just couldn't be funneling money to somebody they wanted to funnel money to without the city getting what they were supposed to get. \nSPEAKER_10:  Is that a policy of the city that is \nSPEAKER_10:  I mean, it makes sense that it would be, and it sounds like you're working with that, but does each department know that's how it's supposed to be and how do they know that? Is this just common sense or what? So that's why I said, are there guidelines? \nSPEAKER_08:  Absolutely, so I'll take a stab at this and then Ruby will correct me if I'm incorrect. So, the \nSPEAKER_08:  set up of users in the system to be able to initiate those documents and approve those documents and do the purchasing portion versus the accounts payable portion is all centrally managed so that those conflicts can be identified and mitigated within the system. So in terms of your answer to whether that is all written down I would defer to Ruby or we may have to get back to you to confirm but it is absolutely standard practice and there is a separate established work group that is tasked with ensuring that that takes place so it's not up to the departments to grant themselves system access to be able to do those tasks it's overseen centrally so that that is monitored. Ruby can you add anything? \nSPEAKER_12:  Um, no, that that is correct. What you just said, um, Sandy, we don't have a policy and like a written policy in place that speaks to this. Um, but it is what we share with the departments. We provide training and it is something that we look for when we are setting up these. \nSPEAKER_08: \u5927\u5bb6 \nSPEAKER_12:  in the financial system. And it's something that, like I mentioned earlier, technology innovation, who was tasked with \nSPEAKER_12:  looking at those system controls that they identify anything bad. \nSPEAKER_12:  is crossing over where we are liking that control. \nSPEAKER_12:  and then they will address it with a department and ensure that we remedy that issue just like Sandy explained. \nSPEAKER_08:  And Ruby also just to verify me as I shared this next piece of information. In addition to doing that every time a user is requested for setup within the system, we also do an annual review of all of our user security to ensure that it's all up to date and appropriate. Is that correct? Also Ruby? \nSPEAKER_12:  Yes, that is an annual review that TID manages and it impacts all city departments. \nSPEAKER_12:  And we all oversee that process internally within our own departments for that very purpose. \nSPEAKER_00:  Can I ask a hypothetical to try to get a little more specific on this exact issue? \nSPEAKER_00:  Let's assume for purposes of discussion that I'm the city clerk and I want to hire Ernst & Young to help me audit \nSPEAKER_00:  campaign finance filings. I put together a sole source justification because Ernst in Young has a campaign finance specialty and the other competitors assume for purposes of discussion do not. So somebody had, I write up the justification, it's an appropriate justification. Who's going to review it? \nSPEAKER_06:  it would go through purchasing. Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now who's going to put any exception to Paul? \nSPEAKER_06:  exception to policy or any sole source would go. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so purchasing has to be depending on the isolation. \nSPEAKER_06:  because if we're below the 25,000 again, it's the department. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  even though I'm, no, this is 2500 to 100. It's gonna be 80,000 a year. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, they're not what go through purchasing. Okay. So now somebody has to put together the purchase order. Is that person in purchasing or in my department? \nSPEAKER_00:  that would be in the department. Somebody who reports to me. \nSPEAKER_06:  directly or indirectly. The department, yes, would initiate the purchase order. However, it goes through the workflow and the financial system, so it still would have to go through all the approvals, including the central purchasing. \nSPEAKER_00:  But if I enforce them correctly, the only approval that's needed because I'm the city clerk is the mayor. \nSPEAKER_06:  that has slow, yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  or was I wrong on that, somebody in the mayor's office. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  All department transactions for purchasing with the exception of harbor and water are routed through purchasing so purchasing would in fact see that one. \nSPEAKER_04:  All department. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so now an invoice comes in. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm the city clerk and I'm prepared to sign off on the invoice and I'm a VIPCC card person. I sign the invoice that I received the services from E and Y and that invoice then is sent to the accounts payable department, right? \nSPEAKER_07:  It is entered by someone in the city clerk's office and then it is routed via a munis in the system to the various layers which includes the accounts payable. \nSPEAKER_00:  and your review of that invoice is simply to ensure that I have signed it and that I'm an appropriate signatory. \nSPEAKER_07:  And we also double track and make sure that, you know, the G.L. account is accurate, that the vendor, the details of the actual invoice match to what the record and mueness that they match. \nSPEAKER_00:  So we also look for that. Thank you. That helps me. I don't know if that helps the other folks who were asking questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  asking. \nSPEAKER_00:  I do not have some more questions, but I know you have some more first. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Let me see if there's anything else I have to ask. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll say hi. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think that I am. Oh, I know one other thing I was going to ask. Is there any process or situation where you, when I say you, I mean, generally, the Department of Finance and Procurement sit down with harbor and water and just share ideas about better ways to do stuff? \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, and Tara might have more to add on this, but I know that we, I can think of an instance not too long ago that we, we worked with water, so we do, in fact, do that. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. Because... \nSPEAKER_10:  We haven't gotten to the, I'll just say the bottom of or to a, we don't exactly know how this commission is necessarily going to relate to all the non-city manager departments. But there is a lot of knowledge in these different parts of the city and as long as we have the knowledge, we should, I just would encourage departments as the different silos if you will to share the knowledge and best practices. So that you, each may be learning from either things that are happening in your, in your areas or from, you know, otherwise the expertise that you have among the staff that you have is it's a good way to share the, a lot of the resources that we have within the, within the city. So, all right. Are there any other comments, there are a couple of commissioners that haven't spoken on this item. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  We do we're pretty far behind on our agenda. I'll just tell you that. So I want to wrap this up. I think we, I sense that the commission is going to want to make some recommendations probably or comments back having had a chance to digest this. But I don't think we have time to formulate those today unless someone \nSPEAKER_10:  No. \nSPEAKER_09:  I was wondering. \nSPEAKER_09:  Because we've asked a lot of questions about specific policies and I really appreciate the presentation that you've given us. But as I said earlier, we're kind of nitty gritty people. I'm wondering if it's possible if we could get copies of any written policies that pertain to the procedures that you've outlined for us, just so that we can look at them. And as Commissioner DeBenedict said, indicated we're really bringing some different perspectives in. And we'd like to look at it to see if... \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm sure they're complete. \nSPEAKER_09:  But just if there's anything based on our background that we could recommend to you might help strengthen the policy that you have. So if it's possible that if we could get your written policies on processing, payments, processing, purchase orders, anything that's procedural, because the other thing that we're looking at is trying to make sure that policies are really clear for employees so that they understand how it is they're supposed to do their work. So if you could get that to Heather or Julien for distribution to us, we'd appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. Anything else from the commissioners? \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, well I want to thank you all very, very much for this and for sitting through all our questions and attempts to understand, including those of you on the line that are participating in this as well. And with that, I would ask for a motion to receive and file this presentation please. \nSPEAKER_05:  Jared, did you want to take public comment? \nSPEAKER_10:  pardon? I'll public comment. Of course I'd want to take public comment. I just forgot. Is there any public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_05:  At this time, if anyone in the Zoom meeting would like to speak, please use the right hand feature. \nSPEAKER_05:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, now I would like to ask for a motion to receive and file this presentation. \nSPEAKER_10:  motion by Vice Chair Morales and a second by Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_10:  If there's no further comments, please cast your votes. \nSPEAKER_05:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thanks a lot everyone. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  So let's go on to item number four and this is Update and presentation on the city's conflict of interest codes and the city attorney Taylor Anderson will be presenting and she is online \nSPEAKER_03:  Good afternoon commissioners. My apologies for not being present. I'm recovering from COVID actually. So I'm going to try real hard to get through this presentation without coughing. \nSPEAKER_03:  So this presentation is actually a snippet of a larger presentation that you're going to be receiving in August. \nSPEAKER_03:  So with the city complex of interest codes, there are very tight deadlines with the FPPC. \nSPEAKER_03:  that require \nSPEAKER_03:  the filings to be in a blue by October 1st. It's on a later side. So due to the tight deadlines, we are sharing this presentation now so that you're not getting late notice. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that you're aware that this is coming. But you'll get a larger presentation, as I said, in the context of all of the conflict of interest codes, the city's policies, and then the FPPC regulations next month. \nSPEAKER_03:  So \nSPEAKER_03:  I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  that this is advanced one slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  Too many. There we go. \nSPEAKER_12:  many. \nSPEAKER_03:  So for the City Conflict of Interest Code, it's required by the California political reforma. \nSPEAKER_03:  And it must reflect the current structure of the organization, meaning the city, and properly identify officials, employees, consultants who are required to file statements of economic interest or four of 700s is they're more commonly known. The departments are required to review their COI code at least every even number year, so we're in an even number year now. \nSPEAKER_03:  The role of the city clerk's office is to facilitate, communicate, and educate city departments on this process. \nSPEAKER_03:  The code identifies what financial interests must be disclosed on the Form 700. \nSPEAKER_03:  Currently, all employees designated in the city's COY code are required to report all categories on their form 700. So there are instances where the city can elect a more narrow scope of reporting. We don't do that. If you're required to report, you report everything just as all of our elected officials and city manager do. \nSPEAKER_03:  The FPPC requires the departments are notified that they must review their COI codes by July 1st of this year 2022 and they must be approved by the City Council by October 3rd of this year. \nSPEAKER_03:  The FPPC offers training for employees, tasked with creating or amending their agencies conflict of interest code, including how to adopt or amend the code, the analysis or disclosure categories, how to designate positions and how to assign categories to these positions. The City Clerk also offers \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  education and health to departments as well and then I \nSPEAKER_03:  included a link here for you. \nSPEAKER_03:  or the complete conflict of interest code as of right now, it will be amended after October 3rd. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  So the FAPC requires that a conflict of interest code must provide a reasonable assurance that all foreseeable potential conflict of interest situations will be disclosed or prevented. \nSPEAKER_03:  provide to each affected person a clear and specific statement of their duties under the conflict of interest code. \nSPEAKER_03:  and adequately differentiate between designate and employees with different powers and responsibilities. \nSPEAKER_03:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_03:  So the FPPC recommends the following considerations when a department reviews its conflict of interest code. One, is it, \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  the current code more than five years old. City of Long Beach is on top of it. We do this every two years and clerk sends out those notices and files with the FBBC. \nSPEAKER_01:  have there been any substantial changes to the department's organizational structure since the current code was adopted. \nSPEAKER_01:  Have any positions been eliminated or renamed since the current code was adopted? Have any new positions been added since the current code was adopted? Have there been any substantial changes in duties or responsibilities? \nSPEAKER_01:  for any position since the current code was adopted. \nSPEAKER_01:  If a department answers yes to any of the above questions, most likely a conflict of interest code will need to be amended. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's a little bit tiny on the screen, but you've got an email copy of this. This is an example of an updated code. As you can see, there's disclosure category is lbc-01. That again is the largest disclosure category possible for the forum 700. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's filed with the city clerk for the great majority of these positions for the water department. Remained unchanged, it looks like they added two positions that are now required. \nSPEAKER_01:  on... \nSPEAKER_01:  to file. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  That might be the conclusion. \nSPEAKER_01:  So in speaking with the chair and vice chair on these conflict of interest codes because of the tight deadline. Like I said, we wanted to make you aware of that this deadline was. \nSPEAKER_01:  jetting passes quite quickly, but it does give this commission ample time. \nSPEAKER_01:  thoughtful consideration on how they want to and can participate with the departments for the 2024 year and findings. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that there will need to be a \nSPEAKER_01:  probably an ad hoc discussion or discussion of the commission on how you would participate. \nSPEAKER_01:  as we discussed with the chair and vice chair. \nSPEAKER_01:  This analysis is done at the department level. It is legally required to be decentralized for the FBPC. \nSPEAKER_01:  And it is very specific to job duties and matching what those duties are with the FBPC code, both for consultants and for employees on who is required to file. So how this commission participates in this process, it is part of your charter duties to assist the departments with their conflict of interest code. At this time, staff does not have a recommendation on how you can do that due to the tight deadline. \nSPEAKER_01:  that's required by the FPPC. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, we're happy to participate in any discussion with this commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  On how you can do that, I would recommend waiting to fully discuss, again, totally up to you, until you've gotten a full picture too of all of the conflict of interest codes and what everything looks like. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I'm happy to answer questions that you may have today on this specific \nSPEAKER_01:  part of the conflict of interest code. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks, Taylor. I have a couple of questions that have come up since we did talk about this briefly. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it was last week and also having seen this list from the water department and Also have hey haven't had the benefit of a discussion with the city clerk \nSPEAKER_05:  My understanding is that something like 900 employees file 700 forms. \nSPEAKER_05:  And if that's right, then does that mean that next month we're going to receive lists like this water department list that you gave us the total of which will cover 900 employees? \nSPEAKER_01:  I have to defer to the clerk on the quantity, but \nSPEAKER_01:  If the clerk is saying that it's 900 employees, it likely will be at least 900 employees. It depends on \nSPEAKER_01:  which departments are going to be adding positions and which departments are going to be taking away positions, which is a normal part of \nSPEAKER_01:  the city process happens all the time. So as positions are added and taken away, this list has to be updated and refiled. So I believe \nSPEAKER_01:  That link that I included. \nSPEAKER_00: \u4e91 \nSPEAKER_01:  in my presentation links to the full document for all. \nSPEAKER_01:  all the \nSPEAKER_01:  and is available on the clerk's public facing website. \nSPEAKER_02:  touch ordigitn \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know if there's anything that you would like to add. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, this is JT from the Seeklicks office. So I believe it's about like 500 employees that file and then the rest are commissioners. There's a total of 900 filers that file form 700s. But I think it's either 400 or 500 are either 400 or 500 of the totals for the commissioners and then it's a 400 or 500 total for the employees. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, well, maybe that's an improvement, but that's still a lot of positions. \nSPEAKER_06:  those are bodies there could be fewer positions based on \nSPEAKER_06:  job classification if people hold a similar job classification. Right. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_05:  So another thing that to me is confusing is when you talk about reviewing the code, we're really talking about at least at this point just talking about who the employees are, the positions are that are going to be filing the 700 forms as opposed to what the substance of the conflict of interest policy is. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this is one slice of a very large pizza. \nSPEAKER_01:  conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  covers a few different areas. The presentation in August will cover the ethics handbook section on conflict of interest, which is related to the FBPC. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can touch on the conflict of interest vote again. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then the additional FPPC regulations on conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so what? \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's a pretty, it's a pretty big universe. This is one piece of it that is extremely time sensitive. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it's a big deal. \nSPEAKER_05:  that being the identity of these positions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, which are required to be filed with the FBBC in October. Okay. Well. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  In my view, it's important that staff do make a recommendation to the commission at the time that these, I'm going to call them lists of positions are presented as to how we should handle the, how the commission should handle the review. And I also would request because of what would appear to be the volume involved that if there's a way to issue some of this material to the commission earlier, then sometimes we get materials that would be good, even if it's just partial in terms of some departments are done some aren't. So I think I'm concerned about how we'll have a meaningful discussion about this otherwise. \nSPEAKER_01:  I mean, I really think that we can make suggestions, but it's really on how you want to engage with the departments. We could have the departments send. \nSPEAKER_01:  uh memos to you guys when they make the filings with an explanation so that you can review after after the fact. They don't these filings can be done at any time. They are only legally required to be updated when a position is added and then they must be reviewed every two years. \nSPEAKER_01:  So \nSPEAKER_01:  If there's something wrong with one of the forms, or you think that some kind of... \nSPEAKER_01:  So, my adjustment needs to be made. It can be made at any time. That's not a problem. The issue is ensuring that the city is complying with the FBPC is deadline to have a complete updated. \nSPEAKER_01:  and really forcing the departments to review their forms. \nSPEAKER_01:  every two years. \nSPEAKER_01:  So there's also, if you wanted the other suggestion that we thought of was, if you want to think of a way to like a handbook to help the departments, \nSPEAKER_01:  The regulations for this part of the conflict of interest codes is a little nuanced and it is harder to digest my office in the clerk's office typically supports the departments when they're going through this. \nSPEAKER_01:  But as far... \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not what I'm saying is in all honesty. \nSPEAKER_01:  We would need more direction from you if you want to engage the departments before they make these filings. \nSPEAKER_01:  because they're completing this review. \nSPEAKER_05:  time. \nSPEAKER_01:  right now. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, in all honesty, I don't see how this commission could have a lot of input into this process for this time period. \nSPEAKER_05:  because I think your idea of perhaps helping understand, you know, helping with the materials that inform the department about how to apply the rules makes a lot of sense, but that's not going to happen. \nSPEAKER_05:  in any meaningful way before this report is due. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I don't, I really honestly don't see that happening this year. I think the best thing for this commission to do would be to look forward in a way that they can meaningful. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  It engage in a meaningful participation with the departments in this process have that outline so that staff can prepare in advance and provide notice to the departments if that's something that this commission wants. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, well, I think we're going to have to explore this further, but like I said, I think any recommendations that you can bring to the commission for how to handle this in August, I think would be, would be welcome. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the idea of the cheat sheet is a good one, but that obviously isn't going to get developed before they have to. \nSPEAKER_01:  Understood. \nSPEAKER_05:  turn these reports in anyway. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, but I mean, this is a process, like I said, that happens every two years and it has consistently. \nSPEAKER_01:  or \nSPEAKER_01:  when positions are added, so and taken away. So. \nSPEAKER_00:  So \nSPEAKER_00:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not to say that you can't participate before then, but \nSPEAKER_01:  This is something like with most of the projects of the commission, not something that should be taken lightly, likely will take time. \nSPEAKER_01:  And all honestly, I don't see a way for you guys to engage this. \nSPEAKER_01:  season, but we can set you up in the departments of for success for the 2024 year. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  and when the filings have. \nSPEAKER_05:  and win the \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm going to go into the next item here, which is to say that I think this work needs to be added to our work plan and it needs to get on the calendar in a way that we can make a meaningful contribution to the process or the improvement of the process and the understanding of the departments as they go about the work that they're required to go about under the FPPC rules. \nSPEAKER_05:  So are there other comments from commissioners on this? Commissioner Chatwell. \nSPEAKER_00:  I hate to belabor it, but first of all, I do think that it might be addressed in our action plan as part of 2.9. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  and let's our timing for that. I agree, and do believe it is in there. \nSPEAKER_00:  The timing for that was Q2 of 20 right now it's been adjusted in for item number five to Q looks like Q2 2020 \nSPEAKER_00:  3. Fiscal Year 2023. \nSPEAKER_01:  It may be helpful also for this commission because of the volume of projects that you have. \nSPEAKER_01:  to revisit. \nSPEAKER_01:  your action plan and what the priorities for so that staff isn't making a judgment call on your behalf in trying to prioritize these things. \nSPEAKER_01:  For example, this meeting had two other agenda items that were piled on top of it. We have about 15 minutes left. \nSPEAKER_01:  Both of those items were pretty substantial. \nSPEAKER_01:  and substantive items. So it would be very helpful to staff if you helped us prioritize what is important to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  so that we can help shape for you through this process, help get these projects accomplished. You have a lot of important work before you. This is definitely one of those things. And we absolutely don't want anything to fall into the cracks and want to assist you in this. So if there's additional guidance that you guys can give, \nSPEAKER_01:  on how you want your calendar to move forward. I think that revisiting might be helpful. I think there are things that have come up that this commission maybe didn't anticipate. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  that you're still working through and trying to wrap your arms around. So... \nSPEAKER_01:  Just throwing that out there is an idea completely up to you. We can continue on the path that we're on now, but you do. \nSPEAKER_01:  to put it gently if everything is important. Nothing is important. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you guys can help us. \nSPEAKER_01:  identify the things that are the utmost priority to accomplish first. We can help \nSPEAKER_01:  um, ensure that those projects are moving along and getting done on your behalf. That's already happening, but I definitely get a sense of everything is starting to be important, which it absolutely is. \nSPEAKER_01:  but there definitely has to be some level of prioritization so that staff can assist you. \nSPEAKER_05:  but they're definitely. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll just say for myself and it may just be me, but I did not understand that there was a statutory requirement that was folded into the work in 2.9. Had I known there was an October deadline on this earlier than just recently, I would have pushed harder to bring this forward. So I think when there are statutory deadlines connected with anything this commission is supposed to be responsible for, that needs to be a special color line in the work plan or something like that so that we don't get caught. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  If I may, I think actually 2.9, while I don't want to suggest that the lists are not important, 2.9 is something else. 2.9 is about... about... \nSPEAKER_04:  A conflict of interest, we call it a conflict of interest code, but it's really the information that's provided in the ethics handbook, which is stated as policy. It's the substance of what is a conflict of interest and what should a person do when they have a conflict of interest in to the earlier discussion, who is auditing, if you will, individual determinations of whether they have a conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's correct commission. So yes. And. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. And so, if I may, there is also a section in your powers and duties that specifically says to assist departments in developing their conflict of interest codes as required by state law. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you're seeing that as separate, then we should definitely have a different category to. \nSPEAKER_01:  your action plan for this because when I was reading it I saw them as the same. \nSPEAKER_04:  I understand because now I understand that the city treats those lists as codes, as the quote conflict of interest code. We were several of us at least, I won't speak for everyone. We're coming from a different place where conflict of interest code is the substance of how I determine if I have a conflict of interest. So I think we need to add the lists, should have them flagged. 2.9 is really on the substance of conflict of interest policies. \nSPEAKER_04:  that is being made. The hand made it, which is now included in the handbook, I don't know if we would recommend that it be a policy or, obviously, now we can't call it a code, because that would cause confusion in the city, but some, you know, in some other document. And I do have a question, Taylor. I know that you have commented on too many ad hoc committees operating at once, and the campaign, the lobbying ad hoc is continuing in existence for at least another meeting. Can we form an ad hoc with people who are not on the lobbying ad hoc? \nSPEAKER_04:  to run in parallel. \nSPEAKER_06:  communications ad hoc also. So that's probably got to, that's probably a discussion that we can take up in item 7. Okay. Because I don't know what's going to happen with it. They're going to continue them. We've already got to ad hoc. Okay. Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that's probably got \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, but maybe win. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, and so I would inform another \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and so I would \nSPEAKER_01:  I would encourage you to and so the other option for this commission, you know, if \nSPEAKER_01:  because \nSPEAKER_01:  And we can revisit this more in the ad hoc item. But if this is starting to be a problem, you have the option to have standing committees, but those standing committees need to be staffed, and they need to be Brown Act notice, and they need to be open to the public. \nSPEAKER_01:  So if you feel like the work. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that's it. \nSPEAKER_01:  is not getting done and you want it to get done faster and you want to get around this issue. \nSPEAKER_01:  You can have public facing meetings with standing committees. The other option is that the full commission works on an item rather than \nSPEAKER_01:  a subset of the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  So you do have options besides the ad hoc to resolve this issue of the amount of work that you have to do. Like I said, we can have a full discussion at the ad hoc portion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  But I do have concerns about continuing to add ad hoc and we're now starting to create incidental serial communications where, you know, we have multiple commissioners on multiple. \nSPEAKER_01:  at Hawks. \nSPEAKER_01:  and risk violating the brown there. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can't make Ralph Brown upset. It's very bad. \nSPEAKER_04:  understood but a standing committee requires staffing and therefore it's got the same problems with the with with the city staff ability to support it as as we have with our agendas so we'll we'll talk about it when we get to the ad hox. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. Is it? \nSPEAKER_00:  I actually not really even asked my question. So I agree with Commissioner Pollock that what we contemplated in 2.9 was something different. It was really focusing on what the Commission's policy is, which is really articulated, I guess, in the Commission's and the City's handbook. I will say that I believe this is being presented next month when we do present. I would be very interested in addition to financial, potential financial conflicts. I'll also be interested in hearing what conflicts we have, say, with hiring and supervision within the City conflicts, so along that line, you'll see it's really the chain of command, nepotism, things all in that line. And then separately, outside activities and restrictions that we have with regard to outside activities. This is an area that I'm very interested in. And with regard to that, I would also really kind of want staffs when you present to us, not just what the City has, but thoughts that staff has on what can be improved and what should be in place. And also along that line, I understand we have a handbook, but I really want some thoughts to whether or not you really feel that a handbook has the full force of the City in the Gravitoss that it's conveying to City employees that this is something that you are absolutely required to adhere to as opposed to guidelines. So I get really concerned when we refer to things as guidelines and things like that. And so I don't need to have these answered right now, but it's just a preview of some of the things I'll be very much interested in in our next meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner, if I could make a suggestion, because really this form that Taylor is planning to present on is pretty large in encompassing in and of itself. I think that we're going to have too big of an item to discuss if we start adding nepotism and some of the other items that you want to cover. This is really financial. \nSPEAKER_06:  So can we add that to a subsequent agenda to give staff the time to prepare? I know Julian had sent out to us the policy that the city has on hiring and nepotism. So maybe we can schedule in September or October some of those other items. \nSPEAKER_06:  But let us look at the work schedule. I think if we add those into this item, it's going to take the agenda. \nSPEAKER_06:  too expansive. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_01:  I-I-I-I \nSPEAKER_01:  Echo device chairs concern my presentations already 45 pages and I tried to cut it down so it's it's very dense I'm happy to do that I agree with her suggestion \nSPEAKER_01:  If you don't mind pushing it out a little bit, that may be better. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would say that I agree with that. I'm frustrated by the amount of time. Maybe I just misread the update on section 2.9 because I figured that these items would be things that would be included in that August presentation. I didn't understand that that was limited in that with this language here to the financial. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's mostly because the FTPC policies are... \nSPEAKER_01:  directly concerned with \nSPEAKER_01:  the financial involvement. \nSPEAKER_01:  If the conflict of interest policies that we're going to cover next week or next week, next month are directly related to financial. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that there are different kinds of conflicts. We also have a revolving door policy. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I can look at maybe packaging these quote-unquote other conflicts of interest into a presentation at a later date for you to cover these other areas that aren't financial. \nSPEAKER_06:  And maybe if we're all through traveling for the summer, we can do more session at the end of August. \nSPEAKER_01:  session at the end of the talk. \nSPEAKER_06:  to look at some of these questions so it doesn't get pushed out too far. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. Is there anything further on item number five? \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sorry, we're still on item number four. Anything further on item number four. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is anyone from the public have any comments on this item? \nSPEAKER_03:  At this time, if any members of the poke would like to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature in the Zoom meeting. Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, we have a motion to receive and file the \nSPEAKER_05:  presentation on the conflict of interest code. \nSPEAKER_05:  We have a motion by Commissioner DiBanedictus and a second by Commissioner Shotwell. No further comment. Please cast your votes. \nSPEAKER_03:  ShareBikes! \nSPEAKER_05:  Bogging. \nSPEAKER_03:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. Item number five on update on the Ethics Commission Action Plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  Speak of the devil. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm speaking of the plan, not the presenter. The presenter. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, I will say she looked at me when she said that. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  just \nSPEAKER_00:  Oh, yes. So last month, there was an ask to bring the action plan back to providing the updates. So you can see it here before you. The just like beforehand, the deliverable updates are in green under the notes and the next steps. And then please do pay special attention this time to the Timeline priority column. One of the ask was to return, kind of provide any updates on with the information that we have now on where we are to provide updates on the Timeline itself. Just \nSPEAKER_00:  Not to go back to 2.9 but yeah, I just wanted to confirm that the way that Commissioner Pollock explained it is correct. And what we do have, we do have the prescribed duties and responsibilities of the commission at the very bottom of the document. If you'd like, we can bring including the piece about the conflict of interest in assistant departments. But if you guys like, we can incorporate that into the action plan so it kind of has its own assigned deliverables. Just speak like the other ones that were originated from the auto report so we can do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I hope you've had a chance to review this kind of our updates. And again, there's just kind of recommendations from staff of to work. We see things going on what we know. Otherwise, Heather, did you want to add anything? If not, we're open for any questions you may have. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now they're gonna Barbeque \nSPEAKER_05:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_05:  I actually have a question, I think, for Taylor, because I'm just seeing this now, this is our starting to understand now. \nSPEAKER_05:  the meaning of the word conflict of interest code as the city is using it at least with reference to what I'm going to call that water department document that was in the presentation. But in the list of our duties that Julian just referred to, \nSPEAKER_05:  which comes out of the charter, it speaks to the conflict of interest codes. \nSPEAKER_05:  So Taylor, you would interpret that provision in the charter to be referring to these lists of employees that are going to \nSPEAKER_05:  report to the FPPC. Is that right? \nSPEAKER_01:  That is correct because of the way it's more rooted in the charter. The charter specifically references. \nSPEAKER_01:  conflict. \nSPEAKER_01:  of interest codes as required by state law. \nSPEAKER_01:  The presentation that I just gave you is the conflict of interest code required by state law. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the handbook policy, any of those additional policies, while there may be laws pertaining to them? \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm \nSPEAKER_01:  It's not. \nSPEAKER_01:  per se necessary to have a policy in place because they're already legally required. \nSPEAKER_01:  So short answer to your question is yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  The way that I read the charter section is for the conflict of interest codes and filings that are due to the FPPC this October. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll just reiterate my comment that any things that are legally required of us. \nSPEAKER_05:  and have a time limit on them need to be somehow incorporated into the work plan so that we are aware of the upcoming deadlines at all times. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that would be helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've been heard. We understand that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we are growing and learning with you. \nSPEAKER_01:  just as you were growing and learning and trying to refine this process to the extent that staff can anticipate these types of deadlines We will absolutely do so \nSPEAKER_01:  We, you know, as you know, they're Amy retired. She was the ethics expert. I'm doing my best to get up to speed as is Heather and Julian on all things ethics. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Like I said, to the extent that we can give you more notice, we will have to do that in the future. \nSPEAKER_03:  I also had the same misunderstanding and distinction between code and policy and did not realize that until this meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I had another point, but don't know how that's all. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll just make a point of history, which is that two years ago in 2020, we didn't do this. And I think it was because we were in a hustle to get the independent redistricting commission pointed, which was another thing that was required of us. So this is not something that has, we don't have a history with this responsibility. So this will be the first time. And as Taylor said, we are. \nSPEAKER_05:  learning. \nSPEAKER_06:  Two years ago we were seating. \nSPEAKER_06:  our three remaining members and then we were dark for a few months because of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we really didn't come back into meeting until July. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then as you said. \nSPEAKER_05:  I told her I was in here pulling balls out of my mouth. \nSPEAKER_06:  And our focus in July was to get the redistricting commission established because we had a legal deadline for that. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we're doing better this year because we're at least looking at it. Thank you, Taylor. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Chair Weiss, my other question was, when you... \nSPEAKER_01:  Melissa Fragus \nSPEAKER_03:  It is progress. Chairweiss, when you refer to work plan, I think you are referring to the action plan. I just want to be sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, yes, I am. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. And then, um, \nSPEAKER_05:  I really like this additional sheet, the deliverables sheet that Julian prepares based on, you know, pulling out of here, the things that are supposed to happen over the next six months or a year. And that too could show those deadlines, those statutory deadlines of things that we're supposed to be mindful of. Make sure that things get attended to. \nSPEAKER_05:  in time to actually get them done in a meaningful way and be useful. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, anything further on the... \nSPEAKER_05:  action. \nSPEAKER_04:  plan, One-stop-\ud3c9 plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  land. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have one thing, sorry. On 2.7 we received a presentation from HR on the anti-retaliation protection policy. The action plan item was to consider whether any additional changes were needed. The notes suggest that this is now complete. I don't know if the entire commission believes it is. We received the presentation but I don't think we then had a discussion on whether or not we believe the existing policy. \nSPEAKER_04:  is in need of any revision. And I, for one, need to go back and look at the recommendations from the audit before I would have a conclusion on that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I concur with Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_00:  Farrakall correctly, I think at the end of their conclusion, staff asked to \nSPEAKER_00:  email, any questions or recommendations that the Commission had concerning that policy. And we did not receive any, but if there's been, there is additional comment or recommendations, you know, we can revisit that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  Maybe they could get any, if anyone has any comments or questions, who will they and they could get those to you in the next two weeks so that we need, know if we need to add an item to the agenda for next month or not. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's a good idea. And then we will have human resources addressing the family disclosure policy next month. So if there's any immediate, you know, permanent questions, I think we can maybe get a head start there too. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if we don't hear from anyone by the end of July, then we'll presume that everyone was okay with the report as it went forward and there's no additional action necessary so that we could show that item is being closed. \nSPEAKER_03:  I will just add that I still have some concern. And I know we've had a meeting on this. We've addressed it at a meeting, but just the overall approach to how the city does policies the template and form out of those, the consistency of those, how they're managed. Because I think that goes a long way. And I know it's part of a different work stream, but that goes a long way to individuals within the city and the elected's to be able to comply with them. When they're in so many different formats, so many different locations. And so with regard to the anti-retelliation and policy, I'd really like to see, you know, I'll make comments with regard to this particular policy, but I think that I'm with actually anticipating that there would be some form of a recommended redraft of that policy along with pretty much most of the policies. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I think we have, I have, anyone I've mentioned before, but we are currently working to look at the administrative regulations. So right now, I think we've looked at them once. They were PDF and not very accessible. So that's something that, you know, it will take some time because it just reaches so many departments. But that's something that apron are working on to review and update all of them. And then also our goal is to where we're no longer reliant on the PDF format, but more so web-based. So that way, whether it's staff or the public, they can essentially do like a Google search across all administrative regulations, you know, to increase that accessibility piece. \nSPEAKER_00:  That is a big project, but you know that is definitely on our list and it's been worked on \nSPEAKER_01:  project. \nSPEAKER_01:  And if I can just, it's Taylor piggyback off what Julian is saying, there is a central landing page for all city employees called the internet. \nSPEAKER_01:  which contains a breakdown of departments. \nSPEAKER_01:  The departments can post their policies on those websites, so like purchasing has their own section of the internet where they can post all of their policies so that staff can access them. \nSPEAKER_01:  The administrative regulations, the civil service regulations, the ethics guide, financial policies, and personnel policies and procedures are also available on this website. So I think with Julian saying there's a better way that we could probably do it, but we do currently have \nSPEAKER_01:  a central housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  where departments can post their policies so that staff can access them. \nSPEAKER_01:  throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_03:  I thank you. I appreciate that Taylor. I, until I appreciate both what you and Julian are saying, even though they're all on that internet site, though, I look at them as I'm trying to avoid having individuals have to hunt and pack for where they find things and that they can really have one place to go where they get the definitive truth and they know that they're seeing everything that they can put our potentially subject to. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is there anything further on the work plan? \nSPEAKER_05:  the action plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. Seeing none, I'll ask if there's any public comment on this item. \nSPEAKER_02:  At this time, if you like to speak on-site them, please use the raise hand feature to request to speak. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, May. We have a motion to receive and file this update on the action plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  motion by Commissioner Pollock and a second by Commissioner D. Banna Dictus. If there's no further comment, please cast your votes."

We're on to item number six and this is a report from the ethics officer. \nSPEAKER_03:  Tyler. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just a few quick updates. Unfortunately, the code of conduct is still stalled in the meet and confer process in that. \nSPEAKER_04:  There hasn't been any movements since our last meeting. So we are meeting with HR, I believe, next week to figure out. \nSPEAKER_04:  what our next to strategize, what our next steps are. \nSPEAKER_04:  in this so that we can wrap it up. I just don't have anything better to share with you right now on that. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're actively pursuing. I'm prepared to sit down with \nSPEAKER_04:  the union to show the outline of the training. \nSPEAKER_04:  and bit \nSPEAKER_04:  We've reached out twice that I know of requesting that meeting so we can do that and we've not heard back yet. \nSPEAKER_04:  So on a positive note, Julie and I met with NavX once. We're meeting with the Auditor's Office tomorrow to talk about how we can hopefully collaborate on the existing \nSPEAKER_04:  fraud and abuse hotline how we can integrate that with our ethics hotline so \nSPEAKER_04:  that should move. \nSPEAKER_04:  a lot quicker than our code of conduct. So hopefully by next month we'll have even better news for that, but that's progressing. \nSPEAKER_04:  and a positive manner, which we're excited about. \nSPEAKER_04:  So as the Code of Conduct works its way through the meet and confer process still building the education program on the back end. We've introduced the program to our administrative officers that's who we'll be leaning on to help us launch. \nSPEAKER_04:  and um \nSPEAKER_04:  track the education program just help us get into all the departments so \nSPEAKER_04:  Those relationships are starting to be made. The Neogub contract that was approved, I believe I let you know last month, that was approved by the city manager, so that's working its way through the contract approval process. \nSPEAKER_04:  Once the contract is in place, it could take two to four months to implement the learning management system. \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_04:  which means that's just all of the administrators like me and Julian that's all of us learning how to work the system and then get it out to all the different departments. My hope is that I'll have access to the NEOGO once our contract is in place to start actually \nSPEAKER_04:  building the program on that LMS. So \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm more to share with you next month. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then other than that, as you all know, I've been supporting the two active bad hawks right now. We've already talked about our new commissioner, Rao and Norvey. I'm very excited. I worked with Mr. Norvey. \nSPEAKER_04:  in my \nSPEAKER_04:  One of my previous roles in the legislative department, so he and I worked on different neighborhood things for years, so I was excited to see him coming back. \nSPEAKER_04:  into my world and your world. So I think we're all gonna like him. \nSPEAKER_04:  We finally have a new ADA coordinator who starts on Monday. \nSPEAKER_04:  So... \nSPEAKER_04:  I will probably be part time probably another month or so as I'm in towards Jennifer our new ADA coordinator. \nSPEAKER_04:  that I'm... \nSPEAKER_04:  very excited to be able to start. \nSPEAKER_04:  officially pivoting full time into my ethics officer role. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then ECI training and certification, the whole ethics team has signed up for the online training and with the hopes of being certified. It's a self-paced program. Once you start the program, however, you've got 90 days to complete it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  So Julie and I are going to place a bet probably by the end of the week who's going to finish. So we'll see. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then, so we were members now of ECI, we've also become members of SCCE, so I will be going to their 21st annual conference in October. And then I've also signed up for their four-day essentials workshop next month, so excited about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  And with that, I'll turn it back over to you for questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have one question about the contract that you said was in process. Do you have an expectation as to when that's going to be completed? \nSPEAKER_04:  Soon, I don't have an exact date. OK. But I mean, it sounds like it's pretty close. \nSPEAKER_03:  I mean, it sounds like it's pretty close. I mean, either approvals, like, I don't know what size the contract is, and so I don't know, is this something that's going to come before the council or? \nSPEAKER_03:  Sorry. Is it something that's gonna come before the council? \nSPEAKER_04:  No, it was approved already by the city manager, so it's just getting the contract in place. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  So yeah, all the financials have been approved. It's just \nSPEAKER_04:  whatever mechanisms HR. \nSPEAKER_04:  has in place, which I don't understand yet. That's where it is right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I don't anticipate too much longer. I think the longer part is actually staff learning how to navigate the system and working out all of the TI kinks. That's where \nSPEAKER_04:  the time commitments going to be. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, it's good to hear that your former role has been filled. So you'll have lots of time to learn how to manipulate that system to the advantage of the ethical program in the city. So that's great news. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I agree, thank you. I was telling Julie and I didn't realize how heavy that was until we filled the position and I felt free. So, yes, they're very exciting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Good, good. \nSPEAKER_01:  through what it's so. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, sorry. I forgot Cindy was here. She's so quiet. \nSPEAKER_05:  I was like, put you know Julian. \nSPEAKER_05:  So with us today, we have Sydney Thompson. \nSPEAKER_04:  We've got three new management assistants with the city. So Sydney Thompson is one of our, she's on her three month rotation with the city manager's office supporting the ethics program, Long Beach Recovery Act. And there's one more that I always forget. I'll let Sydney introduce herself. She's going to do a much better job than me. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi everyone, really nice to meet you. So as Heather said, I'm on my rotation with the city manager's office. I just graduated with my masters in public policy from the University of Michigan. High-tailed it out of there to never see winter again. I'll be working with the ethics commission with you all supporting Julian Heather's efforts and the LGBTQ plus cultural district working on a community engagement plan as well as the Recovery Act and a number of little ad hoc projects here and there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hey, well welcome. We can use our help we can get. You can tell. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's great to have you. Good to be here. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_03:  A m'ais diwedd a'r f macam o taneld y st84 o cwbrew ac, accog afolt! \nSPEAKER_01:  I really want to commend staff for leveraging and taking advantage of the \nSPEAKER_01:  ECI and the SCCE training so good to you and thank you very much. I also want to, with regard to engagement and reaching out to individuals within the city and organization, I mean not organizations but work groups within the city, just consider whether or not there's an opportunity to actually leverage. In addition to you, but leverage members of this commission one-on-one to have them in those sessions and talking with city employees and elected I think it could be very powerful. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the extent that it's allowed by city. \nSPEAKER_01:  rules. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great, thank you. I will bring that up with Taylor. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Anything else on this item? Is there any public comment on item number 6? This is the update from the ethics officer. \nSPEAKER_00:  at this time if anyone in the Zoom meeting would like to speak please use the Recymed feature. \nSPEAKER_00:  Seeing none, that could Queen's public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. May we have a motion to receive and file this report from the ethics officer? \nSPEAKER_03:  Emotion by Commissioner D. Benedictus and a second by Commissioner Pollock. Please cast your votes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  Karen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. So we're on to item number seven. This is the reports from the ad hoc committees. And let's start with the disclosure policy committee, which I think is Commissioner Fiedler and Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, I'll be giving a brief update on behalf of that ad hoc committee. Commissioner Shotwell and I have met to speak with staff a few times since our last meeting last month and thank you very much to Taylor and Heather and Julian and Sydney as well who attended briefly on the last call for aiding in really helpful discussion for the two of us. So we have made good progress on presenting a good working draft to the full commission for a disclosure policy. That said, it's the committee's kind of current thinking that we want to recommend at least tabling that presentation and continuing an ad hoc discussion for at least one more month for two reasons. One, we have a couple outstanding requests to staff for some research and documents to present to the two of us that would help kind of fine tune the last few details of this policy. And I'll note that those requests were made to staff only last week at our most recent call. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so we think that would be useful. And so probably going to continue those discussions at least one more month. And then the second reason a little more substantially is I think the two of us and staff had found that the \nSPEAKER_00:  What do we call it? The study session at the end of June to discuss potential revisions to the lobbying ordinance to be particularly meaningful for our insight into crafting our own disclosure policy. We understand that \nSPEAKER_00:  This commission's potential recommendations to revisions to lobbying policies that affect lobbyists in the city, elected officials, etc. Has a different, you know, doesn't necessarily overlap entirely with internal communications between amongst members of this commission. That said, we thought it would be prudent to make sure that any recommendations that we eventually make in accordance with that sort of study effort, the lobbying work that we're doing, that those recommendations are consistent with our own disclosure policy. And so with that in mind, we thought we didn't want to rush forward, present the commission with a disclosure policy, and then adopt that policy. And then however many months later, make recommendations to revise lobbying ordinances or things of that nature that would be potentially somehow inconsistent. So we thought we would just kind of continue our ad hoc committee meetings to make sure that our recommendations are consistent along those lines. So I think that \nSPEAKER_00:  should cover kind of what our current thinking is. Commissioner Schott-Welkin chime in if he wants to, but that's kind of the update from this ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't have anything to add. That was excellent. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sounds like good work's gone on. \nSPEAKER_04:  So let's have a report then from the lobbying subcommittee, I think Vice-Journalist is going to present. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So after our in-depth discussion at the end of June, the ad hoc committee has met twice. We have a draft document that lays out what changes we believe should be made in the lobbying ordinance that would be our report back to the city council kind of line by line within the existing ordinance. We are still having some very, very deep discussions. We're pretty much there with the lobbying part of it, but we need to fold in the advocacy part of it. So that's where we're going to go next, is really looking at advocacy. We're looking at how San Diego has folded theirs in and asked Heather to go back and have some conversations with the ethics officer in San Diego about what impact that has had with advocacy. So we are not going to have a report for you in August. Our schedules do not allow us to get back together as an ad hoc until after our August meeting. So probably in September, we are also taking the time to talk with staff. Once we've really got things drawn up, Taylor, we're going to want to talk to you to make sure that we have it in appropriate format, but we really want to get things fleshed out. The chair and I had a conversation on some other topics with the city clerk last week and took that opportunity to ask some questions about some of the things we were thinking of incorporating. And her insight helped us focus on some areas that we needed to address to not really burden what her office was going to do with regards to the reporting by the lobbyist. So that's where we are, and I think we'll have our report back to you in September. \nSPEAKER_03:  And Taylor, once Commissioner Manakee's not here, we could use her as a subject matter expert on nonprofits, right? \nSPEAKER_02:  It depends on the disclosure policy that you adopt, whether you need to disclose, but if you need to call her, that's fine. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, and just to be fully transparent, as we're talking about advocacy and nonprofits, we were thinking that once she's no longer a commissioner, she would be a good resource. And when we established ourself, we said we wanted to bring in community members to really help make sure that our decision making is informed. And we really want to be thoughtful when it comes to nonprofit organizations, because we don't want to get them sideways with any other rules that govern how they can operate. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I just make sure that we do a check of whatever advice she's giving. \nSPEAKER_02:  doesn't affect whatever nonprofits that she participates in. That conflict of interest, fun part. \nSPEAKER_02:  But I... \nSPEAKER_02:  on the \nSPEAKER_02:  Surface, I don't see an issue with it. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, so with reference to the ad hoc committees, we could if needed take an action to develop or create more committees from what I'm hearing, both these committees think they do have plans to do additional work. So I \nSPEAKER_04:  I assume there's not going to be a motion to dissolve them. \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  See you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I do have room chair if you want to add one ad hoc however, but you're limited to \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Maniki who is leaving us next month. Our new commissioner and commissioner, but the Benedictus to avoid issues with the brown act if, if this commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  had additional work that I wanted to engage in. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would suggest we leave these two work groups standing and put over any decisions on a third work group until next month. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that's, that would be the best thing to do as well. And also I think it would be good if we're going to be setting up another ad hoc committee to make sure that the people that are probably going to be on it are all present and willing and etc. \nSPEAKER_00:  in, etc. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, so are there any comments from the public on this item? The ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_01:  At this time, if you'd like to speak in the Zoom meeting, please raise your hand. \nSPEAKER_01:  and seeing none, that concludes both of the comments. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Then we have an emotion to receive and file these reports. \nSPEAKER_04:  I will be motion by Commissioner Pollock and the second by Commissioner Feedler. If there's no further discussion please cast your votes."
