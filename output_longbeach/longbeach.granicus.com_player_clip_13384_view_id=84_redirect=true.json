Okay can you I read the next item please. \nSPEAKER_05: \u6211\u8981\u8aaa\u518d\u898b \nSPEAKER_05:  Item 2 is a recommendation to conduct, receive, and file a study session and receive input regarding the final draft blueprint 2.0. The proposed 10-year plan to create equitable economic opportunities for workers, investors, and entrepreneurs in Long Beach through the year 2030. \nSPEAKER_06:  All righty. \nSPEAKER_06:  So can we go ahead and start with our staff report? \nSPEAKER_05:  So can we go? \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure, happy to do so. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. So as you know, the first blueprint for economic development was approved by Council on April 4th, 2017. \nSPEAKER_01:  Its mission was to create inequitable economic opportunities for workers, investors, and entrepreneurs. \nSPEAKER_01:  including \nSPEAKER_01:  included in that blueprint or several objectives to grow and strengthen, establish industry, cross clusters and sectors in Long Beach, increase access to economic opportunities and low-income communities to advance economic equity. \nSPEAKER_01:  ensure workforce preparedness and business competitiveness through alignment of economic development, training education and community partners, and to make, excuse me, make long-term investments in quality of life strategies to grow business jobs and investments that support a thriving local economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  that blueprint was five years in or was effective for five years and we realized as we needed a new blueprint 2.0, COVID changes in the labor market and the way people seek and access employment opportunities were a driving factor for us. \nSPEAKER_01:  as well as the efforts of the city to support business and residents during the COVID pandemic. And you'll see some key dates and key. \nSPEAKER_01:  plans and elements that help drive and shape the focus of the blueprint 2.0. \nSPEAKER_01:  The main subject I'd like to point out to you is that over 40 round tables, public meetings and study sessions were held over a two year period. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the development of this Blueprint 2.0 that you'll see today and the recommendations associated with it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So our vision for 2030 in blueprint 2.0. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  Aligns to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  the city's previous fiscal year budget that implemented the Long Beach Recovery App. \nSPEAKER_01:  including 33 new economic support programs to help a more inclusive and equitable economic recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  continue to focus on a more inclusive economy by 2030. \nSPEAKER_01:  operationalize our city's digital inclusion roadmap to eliminate the divide for all residents, workers, businesses, and owners by 2025. Incorporate the goals of our racial equity and reconciliation initiative to eliminate economic disparities in communities most impacted by racism and to implement a multi-year action plan for major city real estate assets, including economic empowerment zones, the Queen Mary, and the Convention Center. \nSPEAKER_01:  Also, wrapped into Blueprint 2.0 is the economic development commissions that were published in their call to action in August of 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those included \nSPEAKER_01:  internet for all and information is power and empowering the power list which was made up. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the efforts to. \nSPEAKER_01:  for encompassed by the efforts to address structural racism. \nSPEAKER_01:  at equity. \nSPEAKER_01:  into the essential workforce, invest in the caring economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  concerned for the population health. \nSPEAKER_01:  cultivating the green economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  and creating community pride. \nSPEAKER_01:  and ownership. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the blueprint. \nSPEAKER_01:  2.0 has a \nSPEAKER_06:  Can I just, I'm sorry, and I'll wrap you up. \nSPEAKER_06:  Real quickly, Stacy, I noticed when I was getting onto it, it wasn't a link for the meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there anyone that can just send, do you see the link so she can get on? \nSPEAKER_06:  She's having a problem getting into the meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, we'll send it to her right now. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you kindly and I apologize Nick for interrupting you. \nSPEAKER_05:  and I \nSPEAKER_01:  No, no problem whatsoever. So the focus areas in this blueprint are engines of growth, economic partnerships, economic equity and inclusion, small business retention and attraction talent recruitment and retention. \nSPEAKER_01:  digital connectivity and inclusion, real estate development, and quality of life. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  You'll notice the digital connectivity included, inclusion was added as its own section. \nSPEAKER_01:  or a focus area in the new blue print. \nSPEAKER_01:  Blueprint retains its user-friendly format. \nSPEAKER_01:  with mission statements. \nSPEAKER_01:  objectives and recommendations. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the version you see. \nSPEAKER_01:  does not have the graphics and \nSPEAKER_01:  data elements added to it, which we will do similar to version one, but also as we move forward with the implementation of the blueprint, you'll know that we include to have it translated through language access into \nSPEAKER_01:  our four recognized languages in the city. We will have it in both print and digital format for flexible. \nSPEAKER_01:  distribution. We're working to establish online dashboard for tracking and reporting. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the initiatives or recommendations that are present in the blueprint. \nSPEAKER_01:  working with partners to talk about marketing and promotion for attracting investment into the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  As you saw with some of our Recovery Act and CARES Act programming, there will be. \nSPEAKER_01:  a detailed business plan for each element of the blueprint as funding is identified to support it. \nSPEAKER_01:  We plan to come back to the Economic Development Commission and the Council with an annual update. \nSPEAKER_01:  and also to talk about updates and progress in live events and partnership with both the Long Beach Economic Partnership and CSU LV. \nSPEAKER_01:  additional comment and public input. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the blueprint was made available after our study and listening sessions were... \nSPEAKER_01:  conducted the commission at additional sessions on March 14th, April 11, May 9, and July 11. \nSPEAKER_01:  TFF from the city manager to the council. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the first draft of the report should go out to everybody in early October. \nSPEAKER_01:  There has been a link. \nSPEAKER_01:  available. \nSPEAKER_01:  through economic development. \nSPEAKER_01:  at fourvisitlongbeach.gov to solicit public comment on the draft on a rolling basis. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  and the cover member and draft report will be posted publicly for public review. \nSPEAKER_01:  in advance the final review of the council, which we hope, pending today's action, could be scheduled for October 18th. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then moving forward from the 18th, the timeline holds will have final edits and formatting in quarter one distribution plan will go into effect in quarter two. Work plan development should be complete by quarter three. And we should be prepared to give a first annual report in quarter four of 2023. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that concludes the staff report. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think you need. Is there any public comments on this? \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item two in person, please line up at the podium. If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item two in the zoom, please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have one person. \nSPEAKER_04:  person at the podium. \nSPEAKER_04:  your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I can face. Sixth is your resident. I first want to thank \nSPEAKER_00:  our economic development. \nSPEAKER_00:  team with the former \nSPEAKER_00:  Director John Keisler and \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  and water larkin. \nSPEAKER_00:  and others who came up with the plan, I think that... \nSPEAKER_00:  It's a great document to use the gauge how the city is moving towards the future in 2030. I plan on being here in 2030, so excited to see where development looks like. One thing that I'm curious about, which I didn't see in the plan, \nSPEAKER_00:  yet is the role of city employment with respect to \nSPEAKER_00:  economic development. \nSPEAKER_00:  I feel like... \nSPEAKER_00:  A lot of us. \nSPEAKER_00:  ample opportunity. \nSPEAKER_00:  towards economic stability. \nSPEAKER_00:  moving to the future for our residents. \nSPEAKER_00:  could be used. \nSPEAKER_00:  using the city employment as a vehicle towards that. \nSPEAKER_00:  especially within my district. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the \nSPEAKER_00:  employment. \nSPEAKER_00:  report that you guys put on 2019. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  my district has one of the lowest amount of city employees. So just curious to see an implementation of this, how we can maybe district-wide push hiring efforts to get city employment in some of the lower earning districts. Outside of that, excited to see the live events being focused on with respect to what's the city of the Long Beach can do on the cultural side of things, because we have the opportunity to be in a cultural capital. \nSPEAKER_00:  um \nSPEAKER_00:  outside of that excited to see how our committee here implements the blueprint into the future. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  That concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you so much. And I see that my colleague, \nSPEAKER_06:  Stacey Mungo, Councilwoman Mungo, it's available. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we just finished the presentation from the blue bread. Do you have any comments? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do. Thank you. I want to thank staff for the excellent report. I had a great opportunity to do a quick preview knowing I was going to be a few minutes late today. And I'm really proud of the work that the commission did and the staff did to get us to where we are. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do have a couple of additional comments for \nSPEAKER_07:  consideration by the committee. I love what we're doing in terms of the digital divide and broadband. I just do think that it is a little bit specific in nature in terms of our connectivity. And I'd love to see the staff expand the language a bit to talk about \nSPEAKER_07:  The result side of it, the connectivity, not necessarily the broadband. I know there's a lot of potential sources to get internet into our communities, satellite and other options. I know that there's some test programs that some companies are considering that would be more affordable and provide the same \nSPEAKER_07:  speed during peak times that we really need in those communities, especially after school when our youth need to have access to the internet to do their homework and other things. And so I'd love to see that language expanded. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm also really excited about. \nSPEAKER_07:  some of the other key areas, but I will first hear from my colleagues on the dius before adding additional comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I just want to say thank you, Nick. I appreciate it. I know we went through a lot of this really in detail. \nSPEAKER_06:  last week and thank you for taking even some additional time. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm really, I was excited about the business expansion, the attraction and all the retention pieces of this. And then also how you address \nSPEAKER_06:  non-traditional options for child care. I think that was really important. I think that that became evident especially during COVID. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so I know we really pushed for that. I know it's Council Member Mungo. I know you are one of those two for that extra money and the Recovery Act dollars. So just really appreciate you guys addressing all of that. And just thank you very much for the presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, thank you. I'll just add my comments here. \nSPEAKER_03:  First of all, thanks so much. \nSPEAKER_03:  for putting it out of the blue crack 2.0. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And we got a chance to talk for a bit, Nick and Walter. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm Vivian, so thanks for taking the time. \nSPEAKER_02:  I haven't been able to go through all the problems. \nSPEAKER_02:  and low busy. \nSPEAKER_02:  But I do why? \nSPEAKER_02:  what I've been able to see. \nSPEAKER_02:  And there's some things here that \nSPEAKER_02:  I know our direct result of work this, you know, happens since boot point. \nSPEAKER_02:  1.0 \nSPEAKER_02:  So it's great to see the evolution. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that... \nSPEAKER_02:  Just a few things I'm gonna lift up. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I see I know some of this is here and some of it may not be \nSPEAKER_02:  But I think, you know, in the coming decade, \nSPEAKER_02:  infrastructure and housing production has to be core to our economic strategies. It's going to be an economic driver. \nSPEAKER_02:  We've changed our policies as Blu. \nSPEAKER_02:  one. \nSPEAKER_02:  on Blueprint 1 to add things like local hire and strengthen our project labor agreements. \nSPEAKER_02:  But we have to look at infrastructure and housing and \nSPEAKER_02:  as a real significant driver. \nSPEAKER_02:  I also know there's a lot of focus on aerospace. \nSPEAKER_02:  A lot of seeds have been planted there. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I think that is something that is very exciting about the future of our Long Beach economy. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have to maintain our focus on making sure that the economy works for everyone. \nSPEAKER_02:  So some of the workforce development strategies that we've seen. \nSPEAKER_02:  most recently. \nSPEAKER_02:  and thank you know about the program we're doing. \nSPEAKER_02:  with space beach with the youth. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's a great example. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right, I think we can even pull out examples like that to show how we're going to \nSPEAKER_02:  take these growing clusters and connect it directly. \nSPEAKER_02:  to our workforce. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think there are things, and the speaker talked about. \nSPEAKER_02:  on city employment. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think there are a lot of things that we can do. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'd say help. \nSPEAKER_02:  Make sure that as we hire and \nSPEAKER_02:  We know that we're having a different cold time with retention and the part of that is we could do a better job that hiring people who would appreciate \nSPEAKER_02:  local city jobs like local people who grew up here. \nSPEAKER_02:  or people who may maybe their background. \nSPEAKER_02:  where the resume isn't tight enough. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we can get them on the right track and get them a preference that they're local. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  to make sure that they're a part of our city's workforce. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, there's a lot of focus on \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  you know what it takes the speed up our our planning processes in the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, I talk about three things. East people predictability. \nSPEAKER_02:  I know that that's a key focus, but we need to do more to make sure that \nSPEAKER_02:  Our process is moving forward. \nSPEAKER_02:  easy to navigate for people and expect them, you know, and you know, \nSPEAKER_02:  predictable. \nSPEAKER_02:  I also know that there's been a lot of work. \nSPEAKER_02:  on the implementation side, on the planning side rather, on diversifying entrepreneurship and contracting. \nSPEAKER_02:  We've never actually gotten there. \nSPEAKER_02:  So there's some funding finally recovery. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's a talk about you moving forward on. \nSPEAKER_02:  the procurement study that we've talked about for, you know, \nSPEAKER_02:  the majority of the time that \nSPEAKER_02:  me and Council Member Mungo have been on. \nSPEAKER_02:  The council, I know it's a big focus for our council in the island. I would love to move past planning. \nSPEAKER_02:  and get into \nSPEAKER_02:  strategy and implementation. \nSPEAKER_02:  because there's a lot that we can do to make sure that \nSPEAKER_02:  We are using our procurement to make sure that vulnerable businesses and local businesses \nSPEAKER_02:  have a greater opportunity in technical assistance and support. \nSPEAKER_02:  a number of those days. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman Allen talked about early childhood education. \nSPEAKER_02:  sector helping the promoter stable. \nSPEAKER_02:  on a workforce. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's important that we learn that a lot during \nSPEAKER_02:  the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean, we were living and working. \nSPEAKER_02:  and go into school all in the same room. And... \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, and it's essential and things have changed and stuff. We want people to go to work. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're going to have to think about \nSPEAKER_02:  having a world class child care system in the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  The other thing I'll just mention is that \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  I think culture, you know, we're moving to our cultural centers. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're doing all these things. I think we just. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  need to make sure that \nSPEAKER_02:  You know I will love. \nSPEAKER_02:  that \nSPEAKER_02:  It's more than just reference. \nSPEAKER_02:  but sort of arts and culture need to be economic drivers in the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  Central to business districts, cultural districts. \nSPEAKER_02:  highlighting small businesses that are vulnerable, rather than having. \nSPEAKER_02:  statistically have the same success. \nSPEAKER_02:  We need to make sure that those are things that are important and things that we value. So those are my. \nSPEAKER_02:  My comments, I think I'll sharpen the pencil a little bit before this comes to council to add \nSPEAKER_02:  You know, some more specific feedback, but I think you've done some of the right things. \nSPEAKER_02:  to deploy \nSPEAKER_07:  So I'd love to build on a couple of things that were said and then bring up one additional thing that I thought would be mentioned that I'll start the conversation on. So I love the discussion about childcare. I hope that everyone that really wants to see the future of our economy really grow with take an hour of their life to watch a documentary called Fair Play and it talks a lot about women in the workplace and the cultural issues that we are battling in the United States and how little we spend on childcare. We spend one of the lowest for capitals on childcare. We pay our childcare workers some of the lowest wages and I think that we really need to correct that and I'd love to see some kind of \nSPEAKER_00:  Really. \nSPEAKER_07:  discussion of that in this and I hope that anyone who's willing to spend 99.9 will watch the documentary and use the statistics to better understand why. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then something that councilmember Richardson and I have talked about for a long time is the incentive structure in the state of California for recruiting businesses is not the kind of incentive structure that we as a state should have. And I'd love to see some discussion about adding a bullet related to legislative changes that we can work towards as a large city in California related to incentivizing brain in the businesses that have the highest wages to give to employees. And not the way the incentive to bring in. \nSPEAKER_07:  businesses like car dealerships that or furniture stores that have very few employees that are salary I'm sorry that are bonus based for sales but really don't provide the benefits and the other things to our neighborhoods but they have the sales tax revenue tied to them. \nSPEAKER_07:  And so there's that perverse incentive out of the city. The more businesses we bring in, they don't necessarily sell something. \nSPEAKER_07:  causes some challenges for our budget. \nSPEAKER_07:  that then we have to provide the police and fire and other services, but don't have the revenue to join that. So I'd love to see some, some, \nSPEAKER_07:  language about what we're going to do to focus on using our weight as a large city and legislative leaders that are alumni of the Long Beach City Council at different places in both state and federal levels to help us make a structural change both in supporting women in the workplace and supporting \nSPEAKER_07:  a change to incentivize cities to recruit big. \nSPEAKER_07:  businesses that are small businesses and big businesses that pay big money to residents that invest back in our own communities. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I want to throw it over to Councilman or Vice Mayor Richardson in case he wants to add on that because I know it's something to him and I have just discussed. \nSPEAKER_07:  for about five years now. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would agree. I think some of that is what Nick mentioned in terms of \nSPEAKER_02:  We don't have \nSPEAKER_02:  We don't have incentives to attract businesses or promote. \nSPEAKER_02:  businesses that we have here and that is a big gap to our economic development strategy. I'm glad that that's referenced here. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think there's a lot more that we can do than. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  but you're absolutely right, it's important. \nSPEAKER_02:  We do it in our downtown with conventions. We have promotions fund and when conventions come to town, we can find out. \nSPEAKER_02:  help attract that convention with the fund. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we benefit. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, sometimes 10, 24. \nSPEAKER_02:  just by having that commitment in town. \nSPEAKER_02:  The same thing happens when you invest in an anchor business on a corridor that's struggling. \nSPEAKER_02:  or \nSPEAKER_02:  you help save a business that has. \nSPEAKER_02:  a lot of value on a corridor. I know I've seen these things happen. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a game changer. \nSPEAKER_02:  but we don't have the resources make those things happen. So, and maybe... \nSPEAKER_02:  It may be a state fix or it may be our local government. \nSPEAKER_02:  and hey, we're gonna have to do it ourselves. We're developments gone. \nSPEAKER_02:  How will the state fix everything we can do locally? \nSPEAKER_02:  So I agree with the council member. \nSPEAKER_06:  And also \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, so if I can just add on. \nSPEAKER_06:  to what both of you were talking about local hire is so important in local contracting. One of the things that I \nSPEAKER_06:  have talked with the city manager and talk with Nick about being someone who, my previous business, work a lot with different municipalities throughout Southern California. Long Beach is known that it will work with anyone. There's certain cities you go into and you bother to do RIPs because they work with their local folks. And I said, I'd like to see where we are, city, or where known for working with our local companies when it comes to the procurement process. I know that can't always happen, but I just feel like that we can do a better job. \nSPEAKER_06:  at working \nSPEAKER_06:  working with local folks. \nSPEAKER_06:  I just wanted to add that in and I just appreciate everything that both of my colleagues is that I agree with everything. \nSPEAKER_07:  to add on to Councilman Allen's comments. I can think of examples where we eliminated potential bitters because they didn't meet a particular spec of a... \nSPEAKER_07:  to mention that we felt was important in the procurement, but then we went with another contractor that was from out of the area who wasn't as invested. And we ended up \nSPEAKER_07:  taking twice as long as we probably should have and longer than the original contract stated and had we given that original time in the contract, many more local bidders would have been viable as that option. So I definitely want to work together to make sure that that's \nSPEAKER_07:  local preference is huge. People who live here and work here in owner business here are just so much more invested in making sure the city is successful and I think that that needs to be rewarded. \nSPEAKER_07:  with no further comments. Let's go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  Happy to make the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. That's okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Excellent. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. Chair mango? \nSPEAKER_07:  I \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye, Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_05:  on Councilwoman Allen. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm Ocean Curies. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you.

Open public comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  media. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on general public comment in person, please line up at the podium. \nSPEAKER_04:  if there are any members of the public."
