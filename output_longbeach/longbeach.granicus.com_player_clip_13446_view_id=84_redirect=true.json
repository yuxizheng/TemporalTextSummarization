Heather, are you going to start us off? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  It tells us the safety of parents. It tells us the safety of children. It tells us the safety of parents It tells us the safety of parents. All right, Mr. Thank you, Chi Boat. Please reach the \nSPEAKER_06:  The recommendation went to City Council on Tuesday, November 1st to draft an ordinance with the updated code of conduct that passed unanimously and is scheduled to come back for first reading on Tuesday, November 15th. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Weiss or Vice Chair, did you want to add anything to the report? And you went and represented us. \nSPEAKER_01:  Make sure you're wise, do you want to say anything? \nSPEAKER_07:  Sure. I would say it was the whole idea is was well received by the council and there was \nSPEAKER_07:  comments about further financial support for the work of the commission. There were requests for further assistance to the council members in identifying conflicts and ethical issues. Those are some of the comments that stuck out. But it was a unanimous and unfairly uncontroversial item in front of the council, I would say. That's how I would characterize it. And there was one public speaker who spoke on it. And we thought that it was an issue that we had dealt with already when we were drafting the, when we were working on the code, but we didn't recall the particulars of it. You can watch the hearing if you want to get more info about it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to add, I had an exchange of emails with Taylor. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to make sure that the \nSPEAKER_01:  The other commissioners are aware the language and the ordinance is not identical to the language. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the code as presented because we've got the as a representative of the city I will but all of the \nSPEAKER_01:  Following language in each case is incorporated and it's my understanding that when the employees sign, they'll be signing the language that the commission approved. So just to give folks the benefit of the exchange of emails that we had. \nSPEAKER_04:  That is correct. We'll be using the document that the commission drafted. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  for the employees, but to codify it, we had to tweak the language a little bit, but kept the intent. \nSPEAKER_04:  of what you were um \nSPEAKER_04:  trying to accomplish. \nSPEAKER_04:  worldwide. \nSPEAKER_01:  and I appreciate that and I appreciate your responsiveness when I asked about it. That's all. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I took the opportunity to watch the video the next day and you both represented us. \nSPEAKER_05:  as we knew you would very well. \nSPEAKER_05:  It was very heartening to hear the positive comments and hoolian and Heather you did a great job of not only presenting the code itself but also giving them an overview of some of the work that we've been doing and where we're going to be going in April. I heard you in there also just handing it over to the team. So I think the council recognizes that we have a small but mighty team and as commissioner Weiss had indicated there was a lot of discussion about the need for maybe a going farther and I know that's something that we've spoken about as a commission. Maybe additional resources, additional responsibilities and so I think when \nSPEAKER_05:  when we come back with some of those recommendations we've talked about looking at at some point in time. \nSPEAKER_05:  They'll be received, although there will be a big change in the council by the time we do come forward with anything else. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  And I don't think we need to be there at the meeting this Tuesday. \nSPEAKER_05:  Do you? \nSPEAKER_04:  No. \nSPEAKER_04:  If there's any changes or any problems when it comes to adoption, we can report back and let you know. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  based off the way the initial meeting went. Yeah. And since all the language was already in the council letter, \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  It would be surprised if that happened, but you never know, so, but we can let you know if there are any changes or problems. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  other commissioner want to say anything? \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_05:  shot \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. So I had an opportunity to watch parts of the video in the way my connection wasn't great so I wasn't able to see it as well. I thought though that both Commissioner Weiss and Vice Chair, Pollock did an excellent job I agree. My request, two requests, one, and I think we've talked about this before but it's probably now is the good time to go ahead and start creating a running list of anything that we might want to consider for additions to the code when it is up for next because as we just, as the staff and as commissioners are doing outreach and training there will be questions that come up that we might want to think about incorporating. That's one. And then two, I believe there was a comment at the meeting or maybe it was separately where \nSPEAKER_03:  representative, I think, of the city, or maybe of the city, was questioning our use of the term diversity without and not using the term inclusion. And I believe that actually, is something to put on that list, would be to be even more expansive and go so far as diversity, equity and inclusion. I don't believe we should use diversity and inclusion by themselves, but use diversity, equity and inclusion. And we can consider that for a future revision of the code. \nSPEAKER_05:  That was a member of the public. That was the one public comment who indicated that \nSPEAKER_05:  her organization would support the use of the term inclusion as opposed to diversity. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I on that note, I... \nSPEAKER_03:  think that it would have to be broader than just inclusion. I think we would need to use all three terms to really be inclusive because they do mean different things. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to thank also my colleagues for being patient and for I think they wait about two and a half, three hours to present. \nSPEAKER_00:  and for the presentation and thank you staff as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Feathler, did you want to add anything? \nSPEAKER_03:  No, thank you. Nothing for me. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  I have a motion to receive and file the update. And are we going to talk about this little blue thing later on in your report, Heather? \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  then can I have a motion to receive a file please? \nSPEAKER_05:  I have a motion by Commissioner D. Benedictus and a second by Commissioner Shotwell. J.P. Would you please call the vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  Come share and already. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Dave Van Dijk is. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Feigler? \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner, Sean. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Voice chair Paul?

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, the next item is a recommendation to receive and file a presentation on the city's hiring process, including classification positions types and classification determination methodology. This is something that had come up at our meeting I believe was in September. \nSPEAKER_06:  and we had indicated that we would ask a chart to come back and make a presentation. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, who will the interview going to introduce our guests? \nSPEAKER_00:  Sure, yeah, as in it was a request for civil service to return to us for a presentation. So today we have, we welcome back, Christina Pizarro-Winting, who is Executive Director of the Civil Service to product of the presentation. And this was, as Tim Morales noted, was a request made during the September meeting when we were reviewing the family disclosure policy. There was a question about how does the civil service process work and how do we specifically decide what positions and how they're classified. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, thank you so much. That's a pleasure to be here. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I did have the opportunity to review your September meeting so that I could kind of have a just of what you were looking for and wanted to be clear that the Civil Service Commission has purview over the classified service only. \nSPEAKER_05:  in the hiring and so I'll be talking a little bit about that. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, like yourselves, we have a commission of five members, citizens from the committee, appointed by the mayor, confirmed by the council. \nSPEAKER_05:  We maintain a set of rules and regulations that carry out the merit system. And so we are very proud that we are an independent body that \nSPEAKER_05:  Reports directly to the commission so we do not report to the City Manager, but we are similar to the Water Department and to the port where we report to independent commissions appointed by the mayor and appointed and approved by the \nSPEAKER_05:  Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  These rules and regulations support the merit system. \nSPEAKER_05:  of maintaining a fair and impartial treatment at all times for all classified employees, the classifications, the positions, assignments, and the transactions which affect them. So I like to talk about it as though it is the life cycle of a classified employee. As they come into the organization, we have a team that recruits them, we then have a team \nSPEAKER_05:  that \nSPEAKER_05:  that tests their skills and we'll talk more about this, but it's the entire life cycle, but only of a classified employee. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then it's important to note that over time the commission is in dairatory main flexible. We know that we have to stay current with the times. And so I think we are always looking to be innovative and how we can improve our process but continue to stay true to the merit system. \nSPEAKER_05:  One of the things I heard in your presentation was, uh, \nSPEAKER_05:  looking for some definitions. And so I thought it would be important before I start talking about all of these to talk about the difference between the types of positions. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so first off, \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, I should say we have three. We have classified. We have unclassified. And we have non-career. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the class fight our full or part time employees who have applied through the civil service process. So they're coming through the civil service department and going through all of our processes and being put on an eligible list. \nSPEAKER_05:  The Unclassified. \nSPEAKER_05:  speaks to elected officials, management staff, and their support staff. \nSPEAKER_05:  Some unique and flexible positions as deemed appropriate by the commission. Someone can come to the commission and say this is really important that this be unclassified and the commission takes that each case independently. And then non-career staff are also considered unclassified. \nSPEAKER_05:  The third is non-career, and that's an unclassified position which duties are of a temporary or as-needed nature, and they do not exceed 16-100 hours within a 12-month period. So you can think about types of positions in Parks and Recreation. \nSPEAKER_05:  that are seasonal. \nSPEAKER_05:  lifeguards that are seasonal. Sometimes there may be a position that someone is temporary, filling in for someone that is out. \nSPEAKER_05:  and out of their basic position for a number of different reasons, but they can fill it with a non-career. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that means that the non-career individual doesn't have the permanent status of a classified employee. \nSPEAKER_05:  So before I go on, I just wanted to give you an opportunity ask for any clarification on any of those. \nSPEAKER_05:  because I think it'll be important as we move forward. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So if... \nSPEAKER_02:  a department in the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  wants to post-euroch. \nSPEAKER_02:  who decides whether or not the position is classified or unclassified. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, and I'll go through that entire process. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I will talk about that. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's okay. It just didn't know if the definitions make sense. \nSPEAKER_05:  in terms of the classified, the unclassified, and the non-curve. And we'll see that these are established through the charter. \nSPEAKER_03:  What percentage of the employees of the city are unclassified? Roughly just off the top of your head, no. \nSPEAKER_05:  You can use your\u91d1\u8272. \nSPEAKER_05:  maybe 35 I'm just weird. \nSPEAKER_05:  60-40 it did has been growing so maybe 40% unclassified \nSPEAKER_03:  Unclassified 40. Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  But majority class fine. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so where does this come from? \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  The City Charter Section 1101 talks about creating classifications of employees in the Classified Service, subject to the power of the City Council to establish positions of employment. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  And this is under Article 11 Civil Service. So Civil Service has that responsibility to create the classifications. I will say that we do this in conjunction with our HR partners. \nSPEAKER_05:  We have divided the process in \nSPEAKER_05:  into two sections. So HR will do the \nSPEAKER_05:  analysis of duties in the department so they go out and do the study of are there what are their particular duties for the position. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we'll service then in partnership once those duties are established. So the service will come in and look at what are the minimum qualifications to assess those duties or to be able to do those duties. And with that assessment and creation of the minimum qualifications, that also helps us to determine how we are going to assess candidates. What kind of assessment tool are we going to use? We need something to measure \nSPEAKER_05:  those skills based on the duties that we have that have been identified with human resources and the department. So it's really a in conjunction all three of us working together to make sure that we build the best \nSPEAKER_05:  job description, which we call classification specifications, that is a job description possible. \nSPEAKER_05:  to identify the position. \nSPEAKER_05:  So here's where the \nSPEAKER_05:  Charter also talks about the Section 1102 about the categories of employment. \nSPEAKER_05:  And it is, I wanted to be more specific here so that you can see exactly what the charter says that the unclassified service shell include all officers elected by the people and all employees of such elected officers. So council. \nSPEAKER_05:  City Attorney, City Prosecutor, all of those. Members of all appointed commissions, so all of you, the City Manager and all employees of the City Manager Department that give the City Manager the opportunity to select the team that they need. \nSPEAKER_05:  the city clerk and all employees of the city clerk. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then department heads, one assistant. \nSPEAKER_05:  one assistant department head in each department, Bureau heads, division heads, and one clerk position for each. So this is \nSPEAKER_05:  in general management. \nSPEAKER_06:  So kid. \nSPEAKER_06:  If we could stop for just one second. Sure. So that means that there are some clerical positions in the city that are classified and some that are unclassified based on who they work for. \nSPEAKER_05:  Exactly. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, yes, so everyone in the City Attorney's Office is unclassified. Yes, all clerks, all every bad. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  everybody. \nSPEAKER_06:  pay roll people, everybody in the city attorney's office and everyone. So is that so that if the city attorney changes, they can do a wholesale evacuation of staff and start again? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  so they can build their team as they see fit. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  In addition, I mentioned the discretion of the commission. So a department can come before the commission and state that they think that a position should be unclassified. And that is if it's a nature to require unique and special flexibility for efficient administration. \nSPEAKER_05:  I can an example I can provide for this would be the health department. The health department is \nSPEAKER_05:  heavily grant funded. \nSPEAKER_05:  primarily grant funded. And so it became very necessary for them to be as flexible as possible. And so a classification of public health professional. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  existed. \nSPEAKER_05:  and was deemed unclassified so that they could have this catch all classification to use in the event that their grants were coming and going. And so that's an example. \nSPEAKER_05:  Another example would be during the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_05:  The Health Department again came to us and said, we really need this to be classified because we need to hire very quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so we temporarily deemed things unclassified during the pandemic due to the emergency. So the commission departments can come before the commission and ask for permission to make something unclassified either permanently or temporarily. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So is public health associate? \nSPEAKER_02:  always unclassified once you've made that determination. Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  Public Health Professional. \nSPEAKER_02:  Peace be. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02: \u00edficy.com. \nSPEAKER_02:  So can someone in a different department other than public health? \nSPEAKER_02:  call, say they want to hire a public health associate. \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  typically not, they're only in the health department. Those positions are only in the health department. \nSPEAKER_05:  So there's not a way for someone. If it's deemed, typically if it's deemed unclassified, it's based on the department needs. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so, \nSPEAKER_05:  and other department couldn't say oh I want to just go use that classification because it's unclassified. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  And then the seventh example is the executive secretary of the Board of Harvard Commissioners. \nSPEAKER_05:  and Harvard Department. \nSPEAKER_05:  specific staff. \nSPEAKER_05:  And again, this is all directly outlined in the charter. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then, finally, number eight is the all personnel serving in non-correct positions. \nSPEAKER_05:  as defined by the civil service rules and regulations and that was what I gave you earlier. \nSPEAKER_05:  So those are identified specifically in the charter, and that's where we get our direction on those positions, the unclassified, the classified, and the non-career. \nSPEAKER_03:  And you have oversight over certain Harvard Department employees, even though the Harvard Department say independent agency of the company. \nSPEAKER_05:  We do. They still have classified positions. And so we work with their human resources department as well. We do the recruitment for them. We create. We work with them to create classifications in the classified service. So yes, we work very closely with them. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  But would that be the same for airport water and all of the other? \nSPEAKER_05:  So the only other independent would be water. OK. And we do do the same with water. We work very closely with water on their... \nSPEAKER_05:  Classified and they have \nSPEAKER_05:  far more classified positions and unclassified positions. I would say they're unclassified or just really their management positions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so... \nSPEAKER_05:  Now we talk about class-white positions. So section 1102. \nSPEAKER_05:  has section B and that's where civil service comes in with the classified service shell comprised all positions and not specifically included in this charter in the end class wide service. So it's everything else but what was identified in the end classified. So at this point, \nSPEAKER_05:  Now, how does it happen? How do you get positions? How do you, how does the department request that? So, departments request new positions or classifications through the budget process. \nSPEAKER_05:  and are approved by City Council. So discussions occur months in advance where a department is thinking about a reorganization or they're thinking about new programs that they need. And so they start to have those discussions with human resources and with civil service in terms of, is there a classification that already exists that maybe we could use because we really are trying to keep them \nSPEAKER_05:  to a minimum so that we don't have a lot of different classifications and it's never great to have a single incumbent classification. And so there's always the discussion about is this something that could fit into something else? If not, then they are\u2026 \nSPEAKER_05:  looking at creating a new classification and we worked with the departments to create those classification. \nSPEAKER_05:  but they must also go through the budget process, which means that \nSPEAKER_05:  We look at the HR looks at it, so we'll service looks at it. We look at the financial costs of it is at the right position. It goes through the budget process, which then goes to the city council for approval. And then finally going into a salary schedule. \nSPEAKER_05:  that makes it official, an official classification that we can recruit for. So we can't do any recruitment until it's been approved by the council and there is a salary attached and it's in the salary schedule. And all those documents are on. \nSPEAKER_05:  our website. \nSPEAKER_05:  with all the classifications, with all the salary schedules that are available to the public and to everybody to see. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  And when the budget is adopted annually, the only time positions can be added. Let's say a department got a grant mid-year. Can they go to the council with a special request to accept the grant and add positions? Okay, yes, absolutely. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Upon approval by Council, civil services have already been working in collaboration with human resources and the subject matter experts, which are the individuals in the department. \nSPEAKER_05:  to develop and maintain the classification. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  but they also then have to come to final approval before the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the commission in accordance with their duties and the charter must approve all new classifications. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the hiring process, just kind of this, I think it's, again, I think in terms of life cycles and how things happen. A department submits a requisition to hire. \nSPEAKER_05:  and approval comes to civil service. \nSPEAKER_05:  Before it comes to civil service, there are several approval processes that it must go through. It's being reviewed by human resources, the city manager, the finance department. So there are several approvals that happen before it comes to civil service. Once it comes to civil service, then we work with the department. \nSPEAKER_05:  the subject matter experts in the department to create the recruitment materials. We talk about \nSPEAKER_05:  what they're looking for in specifics. We talk about what we've done before. If we've had a recruitment before, we look at the history and we see what can we do differently and how do we recruit for this position moving forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  once our recruitment. \nSPEAKER_05:  team puts out that information, we then receive applications and we assess those applications using the skills knowledge and abilities that we've identified using a variety of selection processes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Once all of the applications have been assessed and we have deemed candidates eligible and meeting the minimum qualifications. \nSPEAKER_05:  They go on to an eligibility list. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we send that eligibility list to the hiring departments for selection. So we say this group of candidates has been vetted. We've looked at to make sure that they meet the minimum qualifications. Now you get to look at them and determine the fit for your department. And that final selection is made by the department. Civil Services is just creating an applicant pool of eligible candidates. \nSPEAKER_05:  and um \nSPEAKER_05:  With that, the process starts all over again. So we do that for every vacancy that we have. Sometimes we have multiple vacations. Many times we have multiple vacancies in one classification. But often we have multiple vacancies. We always have multiple vacancies throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  just the department have to \nSPEAKER_02:  interview everybody in the applicant list before they can move on. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are different types of lists. So in a list that is banded, \nSPEAKER_05:  They must interview \nSPEAKER_05:  all of the candidates, let's say it's banded A, B, C, and they would like to select somebody in band B. They must interview everybody in band A. \nSPEAKER_05:  before they can select somebody in Band B. So that is our process to ensure equity and fairness that everybody gets looked at in the \nSPEAKER_05:  in the assessment by the department. \nSPEAKER_05:  in the case where we have what we call qualifying. \nSPEAKER_05:  That means everybody is deemed equal. We will do a qualifying list, let's say for example, an engineer. There's not much more we can do because they need a PE license. And so we are just screening for that PE license. And then we send, we say all these candidates are equal. They all have a PE license. The department, we send those lists to the department, department can choose anybody on a qualifying list. So there's not a particular order they have to go in. Only when we've assessed them and created an order for them, do we ask the department to look at those individuals. \nSPEAKER_05:  in that order before being selected. But they can still select somebody in Band-B or Band-C. \nSPEAKER_05:  as long as they've interviewed everybody in A and B. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's a great question. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Maybe I missed it, but how do you, when you create those bands, how do you create the bands? \nSPEAKER_05:  So we're looking at based on whatever tool that we've used to make the assessment. \nSPEAKER_05:  We are looking at \nSPEAKER_05:  breaks in the scores. I see. Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I think there's a little more science to it than people think. \nSPEAKER_02:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And with that, that concludes my presentation. And so... \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a quick question. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh. \nSPEAKER_06:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you for your presentation. That was very good. It answered a lot of questions about the classifications. That was for those of us who come from private industry, it's a lot of learning. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So tell me a little bit about you, you speak about the screening. Yes. Over the skills, knowledge, et cetera. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would imagine there's an employment application. What is to what level is there some kind of an integrity screening, like suspension and department. I'm looking at one of our \nSPEAKER_07:  deeper concerns is conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_07:  where that fits in terms of \nSPEAKER_07:  In particular, nepotism, revolving doors, things like that. What? \nSPEAKER_07:  does your process. \nSPEAKER_07:  contemplate any of that or does only HR. I mean, how do you know who goes into the pool? \nSPEAKER_07:  when they're going to a pipeline to a particular area where there may already be some biases or other issues. \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure. So civil service is really only looking at those skills, knowledge, and ability that the individual has and they're based on what is identified on the job opportunity bulletin. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  That that you were speaking of would go into the background. It would go once a department, that would be on the department end of it. That once the department is looking to hire someone. \nSPEAKER_05:  they would be looking at those. \nSPEAKER_05:  other. \nSPEAKER_05:  items that are not skill related, I should say. \nSPEAKER_05:  Not necessarily job-related but skill-related. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I guess are there any ever concerns on your side with respect to conflict of interest in this area? Are there any standards on the on the department hiring side? I would imagine a human resources has some but if we're going directly to the departments, how do we? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  How do we learn about those standards? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, I'm thinking about that. So Civil Service has no part in that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. So I'm not exactly sure how the department is looking at that, but certainly it would be anything that would be identified. \nSPEAKER_05:  by the department in looking at it, in looking at a background, in looking at a reference. \nSPEAKER_05:  um, certainly \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  I believe there is a question on the application about if anybody works in the city. So there is one, there is that one question. Does somebody, if's on our application? So that's available again, we're not screening somebody out because of that, but that information is available on the application for a department to see because if someone could be applying \nSPEAKER_07:  That sounds very bad... \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, they have a relative that works in the police department. \nSPEAKER_05:  but they're applying for a job in public works. Right. So there is no connection there. But definitely, \nSPEAKER_05:  the department has that information available to them. \nSPEAKER_07:  Does the application question or query about previous public service or is it pretty much just an honor system of what they put on the application? Is there? It is. \nSPEAKER_05:  It is an outer system of what they put on the application. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you very much. Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Cheryl, as I believe my question has been answered. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. Commissioner Schottwell. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, very helpful presentation of a couple of questions. One very simple, just one of the number of classifications we have within the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  probably over 300. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. And then what I kind of a lot of what you talked about. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would have thought was... \nSPEAKER_03:  just my own experience but outside of government would be kind of part of the HR department. So what is the different role between civil service and HR? And along that line to Commissioner Dave Benedictis' question is, you know, a group or like HR watching out for kind of how people answer those questions and making sure that those are flagged and so somebody doesn't hire somebody that's, \nSPEAKER_00:  big \uc18c\ufffdster employees. \nSPEAKER_03:  in the chain of command of somebody else. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, very good question. I have worked other agencies where it was combined. So Long Beach is a little unique in that we separated out or a separate appointing authority. \nSPEAKER_05:  and I think \nSPEAKER_05:  It is such that \nSPEAKER_05:  typically \nSPEAKER_05:  This same function would be in a larger HR. \nSPEAKER_05:  department. In Long Beach, Long Beach chose to make sure that the merit system was upheld and put more. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  I would say more, more teeth in it per se because it's in, it's a charter created department and commission and so they want to make sure that the merit system is followed. So as an independent authority, we get to make sure that \nSPEAKER_05:  We are not creating classifications just to create a job for someone or not. There is a system that people have to follow in order to create those jobs. And so that \nSPEAKER_05:  That is the first layer of \nSPEAKER_05:  watching for \nSPEAKER_05:  making sure that there is not nepotism or there was not \nSPEAKER_05:  you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Favouriteism. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  favoritism, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chronyism, all the isms. \nSPEAKER_03:  The other question I had was I think I came into the meeting while preparing for this particular meeting in term thinking about it as more of a dispute resolution. \nSPEAKER_03:  organization, but you don't have any dispute resolution responsibility or that wasn't covered here. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we do, the employees do have the opportunity to... \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I forget about the permitting. I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, I'll do it. You can continue. Yeah. The employees do have the opportunity to come before the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  You can continue. \nSPEAKER_05:  if they feel that there was. \nSPEAKER_05:  in some \nSPEAKER_05:  part of the process. \nSPEAKER_05:  They were not treated fairly, there was not access. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  or even there was a mistake made and they would like it to come, you know, the commission to look at it. And so they can come before the commission. The other piece that is not \nSPEAKER_05:  related to the recruitment that the commission spends a huge amount of time on is that employees appeal disciplinary actions to the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  that the Commission then does act as a quasi judicial body and they have hearings regarding appeals to discipline. But even at their business meetings someone can come and request \nSPEAKER_05:  consideration of the commission if something happened during their recruitment process that the commission will can refer to staff. You know they missed a deadline, they were screened out of something. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are provisions for them to ask for come before the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think I did draw the connection in the prior presentation. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  dispute in the application process does that only apply to current employees or people that are not currently employed who are trying to apply? \nSPEAKER_05:  It applies to it would be a current application that someone was not being seen. It's not current. \nSPEAKER_06:  But somebody agrees not currently an employee does not have any civil service rights. \nSPEAKER_06:  If they miss a box, they do. \nSPEAKER_05:  if they missed a box. \nSPEAKER_05:  they do, if they're not, they're not currently an employee, but they are trying to become one. \nSPEAKER_06:  if they're not. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  they can come before the commission and say. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is my miss this or \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sorry I did have one other minor question. Do the Harbor and Water Departments have their own HR departments or do they rely on the cities? And where you provide services for Harbor, does Harbor have their own HR? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  So they do have their own HR, but we all work with central HR. \nSPEAKER_05:  So Central HR through the City Manager's Office, they are the big, I'll say capital H. \nSPEAKER_05:  are each department at harbor and water have age. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, I guess Harbor actually has a HR \nSPEAKER_05:  department that they go division their divisions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  water doesn't happen. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Do they have a egg? \nSPEAKER_05:  our division. \nSPEAKER_05:  \ub420 \uc21c\uac04aria \uad6d\ubbfc\ub791 \ub9ce\uc740 assembles PolKS han, tv crew ain. \nSPEAKER_05:  They have administrative officers. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  that every department has an administrative officer, so every department has an HR function. \nSPEAKER_05:  but I would say Harvard Department probably has a much larger \nSPEAKER_05:  HR department but still coming through civil service to create classifications going to central HR \nSPEAKER_05:  to deal with any other creating of those classifications. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  So yeah, they do have a separate pay scale. \nSPEAKER_05:  that goes through their Board of Harvard commissioners. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm still a little slow on. I still want to focus in on who the decision makers are. So let's say I have a department head and I have a position and I decide to \nSPEAKER_02:  call it Public Health Associate. \nSPEAKER_02:  HR says, oh yeah, that looks right. I'm not the health department. Does that go? Does the commission \nSPEAKER_02:  See that at all. \nSPEAKER_02:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  The department works with civil service staff. \nSPEAKER_05:  and civil service staff does the due diligence to determine if it's appropriate or not and then it comes before the commission. Okay, so typically only if civil service staff is recommending. \nSPEAKER_06:  typically \nSPEAKER_05:  approval. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  creation of a classification. So a position would not be... \nSPEAKER_02:  posted as unclassified. \nSPEAKER_02:  unless it fell into one of these and was approved by the Civil Service Commission to be unclassified. \nSPEAKER_05:  for us. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I should say that we also maintain \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  modifications to all the classifications. \nSPEAKER_05:  So we are continually in the modification process and updating. So every time a new bulletin, a new job, \nSPEAKER_05:  announcement comes out. We are we are very committed to making sure that the supporting documentation of the class vacation specification is in line with that. \nSPEAKER_05:  new job description. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it's a heavy lift. \nSPEAKER_02:  And if I was a department head and wanted to create a new classification. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is that really hard? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Department probably say it is. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll be honest, but it's not and again. \nSPEAKER_05:  The hard part is that what we try to say is in our consultative approach, tell us where you're trying to get and we'll help you get there. \nSPEAKER_05:  because oftentimes a department may say, I just want to create this position and this is, you know, because I think this will go faster. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so once we're having those conversations and what does this really do and all of that, that's what takes a little bit of time because we're having that discussion about, is this really the right position? \nSPEAKER_05:  I think an example of that may be a position that the police department wanted to create a civilian position to assist out in the field. And so we've been working with the department to create that. So we know the importance of creating those new positions and really try to bring everybody together to work as quickly as possible. \nSPEAKER_05:  doesn't always happen as quickly as it part what I would like it to but there there is a good \nSPEAKER_05:  intent to make sure that we're creating good classifications that we can. \nSPEAKER_05:  make \nSPEAKER_05:  really good selections from with with good with clarity. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Does anyone else have another question? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you very much for your presentation. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  It was very... \nSPEAKER_06:  eliminating. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I wish the agency I used to work for believed in creating new positions would have made life a lot easier. Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can I have a motion to receive and file the presentation? \nSPEAKER_06:  I need a second. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have a motion by Commissioner Wife and a second by Commissioner T. Benedictus. J.T., will you call? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. Commissioner Nardy? Aye. \nSPEAKER_04:  como se amateur 86 \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Start with your finger integrating the entire Dentometer. \nSPEAKER_04:  Fine. \nSPEAKER_04:  amidst that well. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_04:  Vice-chair Paul. \nSPEAKER_06:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  I tried the motionacco. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_07:  The next item is a recommendation to adopt a resolution amending the rules and procedures of the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  to include a commission disclosure policy and the campaign contribution policy which was previously adopted by the commission. Taylor, are you going to lead us on this or is Commissioner shot well? \nSPEAKER_00:  I have volunteered to lead you on this one. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Since you asked me to make some changes, so I'll walk you through a little refresher of what I did. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the copy of the commission's rules and regulations includes two things. It includes \nSPEAKER_00:  You're campaign contribution policy that was adopted as a separate resolution quite some time ago. And then it includes the disclosure policy right after that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I made some, I made eight weeks. \nSPEAKER_00:  two \nSPEAKER_00:  It's on page 16 to section D to make the language consistent in D1, D2 and D3, D1. \nSPEAKER_00:  was worded a little bit differently. The commission had asked for that to be fixed. So those are the changes that were made. So if you adopt \nSPEAKER_00:  this policy as it's written. \nSPEAKER_00:  that will become the commission's policy. If you want to make changes to it, you can absolutely do that by motion and consent of the entire commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  four. \nSPEAKER_00:  you can make no changes to it. So, completely up to you. I'm available for questions if you have any. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Anyone have any questions? \nSPEAKER_07:  Any questions? \nSPEAKER_07:  JP in our commission to shout well sorry \nSPEAKER_04:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  There was one change I think we talked about the last meeting. I'm sorry I didn't catch it earlier, but is the in the we had used the term written. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think we meant to change that to print printed because you know it right currently on line 17 to page 16 it says copies of written or electronic \nSPEAKER_04:  contacts and I think we were a electronic contract. Contact is also written, so I think we meant to say print it. \nSPEAKER_00:  That is a simple correction that I can make. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we can make that change on the floor. I apologize for not making that change. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  but it doesn't change the substance of what you're trying to adopt, so we don't need to bring the resolution back. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I have a couple more things I want to bring up as I think I did in. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a couple more things that I want to bring up, similar to what I've done in previous discussions on this, examples of situations that I think could come up, and in this case, have come up in the last couple of weeks that I think we need to think about how they would fit into this policy as it's currently worded. And maybe the, forgive me if some of these have been covered before I don't think they have exactly, and maybe the subcommittee when they were working on it thought about these things. But just for example, I think that's a great question. \nSPEAKER_01:  shortly after the City Council agenda was posted. \nSPEAKER_01:  I got a phone call from a reporter who wanted me to talk about and give a reaction to the code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  So I notified \nSPEAKER_01:  the chair and staff that this had happened and we \nSPEAKER_01:  We worked through it and I said at the time, I think this might be required for me to disclose it. And I assume the reporter is being paid by his employer for calling me. \nSPEAKER_01:  But it made me think about whether that was a good thing or a bad thing and whether \nSPEAKER_01:  and how we want this policy to affect \nSPEAKER_01:  or our conduct or conduct of others, including the press in terms of \nSPEAKER_01:  relating to our \nSPEAKER_01:  the work of our commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can tell you from experience on other commissions. \nSPEAKER_01:  This has never been the case here, but if we had a controversial item in front of us, it is possible. This was, my experience was pre-COVID, but it is possible that there would be reporters in the audience. And as we came out of the meeting, they would approach and they would want our comments and say we had voted four to three. They would want us to say something. And so I think we need as a group to talk about how we would handle this. \nSPEAKER_01:  first just because it may happen because some of the things we get into as we go through our work plan could be somewhat controversial may not agree on them all. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then the other thing is how it relates to this policy. And if we want to think about that in connection with this policy before we... \nSPEAKER_01:  Adapted. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's one example. The other example. \nSPEAKER_01:  is \nSPEAKER_01:  in there. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not sure how to put this in the subcommittee work that we're doing on lab being. \nSPEAKER_01:  We received a suggestion. \nSPEAKER_01:  that perhaps \nSPEAKER_01:  We should try out some of our ideas on members of the City Council before we suggested them. \nSPEAKER_01:  to get their temperature. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  that's a process. \nSPEAKER_01:  that I am familiar with in other contexts because a \nSPEAKER_01:  the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know. \nSPEAKER_01:  people working in other capacities in the city may want to make sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  people in the city know what their department is thinking about doing in the future. So they have those kinds of conversations to see what problems people see with that. So under this, under this. \nSPEAKER_01:  under the way this is worded. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those conversations I do not believe would be excluded from reporting. They're not about budgetary items and they're certainly going to be about items that would come. \nSPEAKER_01:  that would be probably coming before the ethics commission for discussion. So is it our \nSPEAKER_01:  intention to report those and if it is then \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we have to realize that that then will affect \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  the ability of the commission to get \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm just going to say early information about how some of the things they're thinking about might be received by the electives that have to approve them. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I think those are significant communication issues about how our work goes forward that we just need to think through as we, as we, \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, if we adapt this, I think the other examples I had brought up for more what I will call \nSPEAKER_01:  social interactions and interactions with members of the community where we have to make it clear that if they talk to us about what they think about something and it's something that we think the commission would fall within the commission's jurisdiction that then their communication with us will probably get get reported and my understanding was that that was something that the subcommittee intended for for us to do. But I wanted to bring up these other two examples of things that have come up or come to my attention just in the last couple weeks that I think are real, are real possibilities as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to look to Commissioner Fadler and Commissioner Chotwell who were on this ad hoc committee. Yeah. To discuss if that was something. I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm happy. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm happy to respond. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's my position first. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  the policy just will take \nSPEAKER_03:  both of your hypotheticals. \nSPEAKER_03:  in turn. \nSPEAKER_03:  Similar hypotheticals were discussed by the subcommittee. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  from listening to your description of these two scenarios. \nSPEAKER_03:  My short answer is yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  The longer answer, short answer is yes, they would be contemplated. \nSPEAKER_03:  for disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  by the policy, but let me add a little \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  a bit more of our thinking behind. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, our reasoning. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  I think \nSPEAKER_03:  I think I'm picking up on a theme that there's a \nSPEAKER_03:  concern that \nSPEAKER_03:  any in all communications or you know a large \nSPEAKER_03:  subset of communications with anybody. \nSPEAKER_03:  that we are suddenly bound to \nSPEAKER_03:  disclosed. \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every subjective side. \nSPEAKER_03:  shared by \nSPEAKER_03:  the person with whom we're speaking. So if I run into somebody at a grocery store or to use \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise's examples. \nSPEAKER_03:  social interactions. \nSPEAKER_03:  and somebody says \nSPEAKER_03:  I think they they they oh pine on something that would come within. \nSPEAKER_03:  the purview of our commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't necessarily think. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  the format of disclosure that we put in this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  requires us to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every subjective \nSPEAKER_03:  thought or opinion shared. \nSPEAKER_03:  by the person we spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm looking at page 16. \nSPEAKER_03:  of the handout that \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Taylor circulated. \nSPEAKER_03:  There's subsection B titled Format of Disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have to disclose the name of the group or the individual. \nSPEAKER_03:  When it happened and I'll skip over three and four for a second and then number five. \nSPEAKER_03:  If the person was compensated for the communication so three and four subject matter. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  for short description of any oral context. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is \nSPEAKER_03:  purposely a little bit vague. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  in the spirit of trying to move. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  We understand that this is going to be \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  somewhat dependent on the subjective \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of uh... \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, \nSPEAKER_03:  going to be dependent on the person making the disclosure to sort of \nSPEAKER_03:  determine what qualifies as disclosing the subject matter of the communication and the short description of any oral context. \nSPEAKER_03:  I shared in the subcommittee and I think \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  idea was in in putting forward this policy as written to the whole commission that \nSPEAKER_03:  dead. \nSPEAKER_03:  Subsection three and subsection four do not necessarily require us. \nSPEAKER_03:  to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  that say I ran into somebody at a party. \nSPEAKER_03:  That person said they hate this, they hate that, they wish we did this. \nSPEAKER_03:  differently the city should make these five changes. \nSPEAKER_03:  et cetera. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  We would chill. \nSPEAKER_03:  that person's ability to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  those thoughts if we then just \nSPEAKER_03:  turn around and disclose it verbatim. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that's what this policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  contemplates. I think this policy contemplates. \nSPEAKER_03:  something to be effective. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm at a party. \nSPEAKER_03:  ran into Joe Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Joe Smith and I discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know. \nSPEAKER_03:  with a very sort of factual objective description we discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, certain. \nSPEAKER_03:  while being \nSPEAKER_03:  lobbying policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  discuss and maybe you describe those policies. \nSPEAKER_03:  without necessarily describing \nSPEAKER_03:  each and every \nSPEAKER_03:  um, thought or opinion that that person attached. \nSPEAKER_03:  two \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  the subject matter of the context. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  To the extent there's this larger concern about social context. \nSPEAKER_03:  being, you know, \nSPEAKER_03:  people are never going to speak to us about their concerns if they know. \nSPEAKER_03:  that \nSPEAKER_03:  we have to disclose it publicly. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think there is some leeway. \nSPEAKER_03:  to just \nSPEAKER_03:  identify who you spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what you generally spoke about. \nSPEAKER_03:  without having to \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of take any further steps. I think this is simply about disclosing baseline facts. \nSPEAKER_03:  about who went where. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So that \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  soon. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's my first response as to the kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  social contact type of medical that has come up a few times. \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  with that said. \nSPEAKER_03:  The second hypothetical did. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Wise talked about. \nSPEAKER_03:  the suggestion to float certain ideas to a city council person. \nSPEAKER_03:  Same thing applies. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, I think this policy would like \nSPEAKER_03:  to advance. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency in the way that we would \nSPEAKER_03:  in a sense that we would disclose. \nSPEAKER_03:  who you spoke with. \nSPEAKER_03:  when \nSPEAKER_03:  on what topics. \nSPEAKER_03:  but if that city council person wants the freedom to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  their subjective thoughts on certain policies or ideas that you float to them. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think necessarily that this policy requires YouTube. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just, you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Layout in full. \nSPEAKER_03:  that person's \nSPEAKER_03:  subjective thinking. \nSPEAKER_03:  on those items. It's simply disclosing to the public that I met with \nSPEAKER_03:  Council. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman \nSPEAKER_03:  Snid. \nSPEAKER_03:  on this day and we spoke about \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, a couple of the \nSPEAKER_03:  ideas, you know, one idea, two idea, three. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think you then need to say Councilman. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  I tell you guys, it sounds good. \nSPEAKER_03:  thought idea one was terrible. \nSPEAKER_03:  thought idea too was great. \nSPEAKER_03:  It, it, it, etc. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Last thing I'll say is the first hypothetical about the \nSPEAKER_03:  phone call from reporter. \nSPEAKER_03:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  Looking at Taylor's handout, sub-subsection D, communications where no disclosure is required. \nSPEAKER_03:  on page 16 going into page 17. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Here's a \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of subsection two. \nSPEAKER_03:  Basically, the gist of that is \nSPEAKER_03:  If a contact is not made, \nSPEAKER_03:  the purpose of influencing the decision-making authority of the Commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  you do not need to disclose it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if a reporter calls you and says, \nSPEAKER_03:  comment on something that just came before the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think. \nSPEAKER_03:  that that reporter is contacting you with the purpose of influencing your decision making. \nSPEAKER_03:  the way that we \nSPEAKER_03:  think about somebody who might want to come to us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  actually \nSPEAKER_03:  advance a certain agenda. \nSPEAKER_03:  that then we could. \nSPEAKER_03:  without disclosing to the public. \nSPEAKER_03:  That may influence our vote on a certain agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that the \nSPEAKER_03:  reporter scenario. \nSPEAKER_03:  that Commissioner Wise outlined. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know runs into that issue. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that \nSPEAKER_03:  uh \nSPEAKER_03:  Whichever subsection D. \nSPEAKER_03:  subsection two of subsection D. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a contact that I think is squarely. \nSPEAKER_03:  outside the \nSPEAKER_03:  the scope of the policy. So those are my thoughts quickly without organizing them. I'm sorry for for taking up time. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know Commissioner Shaw will probably have some thoughts. I'm happy to answer other questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  No need to apologize, Commissioner Feetler, that was very comprehensive and I appreciate your thought process. \nSPEAKER_07:  Let me show you a shot. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I would agree and I think that Commissioner Feele will summarize it very well. \nSPEAKER_04:  I was just going to add that the same concept with regard to the reporter is on kind of the preamble to this particular section. So on page 15 line 25, it's where we're getting across the point. Is this information that we're receiving from an individual in the public or someone as opposed to information that they are providing to us? I do think Commissioner Weiss did raise a concern when she was raising the concern she raised caused me to think just of, I'm always concerned about this. I believe in this policy, I believe in the transparency it provides, but I'm also concerned that anything that would kind of, \nSPEAKER_04:  quiet speech or make people uncomfortable about raising a concern. And one would be, say, an individual in the public approach to member of the ethics commission in a time of say a city election and expressed a concern about a particular candidate. And I think we might need to consider, I can tell you that I think, a member of the member of the public knew that it was going to be made a public record, that their name was going to be associated with a concern that they made about a particular candidate, that they would probably not make the comment, or in some cases they would not make the comment. And I think that is a potential concern that we might want to think about. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Go ahead, Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh oh, you froze. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hopefully we get it back. \nSPEAKER_04:  Hopefully we get it. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Do any of the other commissioners have any comments? \nSPEAKER_07:  concerns. \nSPEAKER_07: \u4e8b \nSPEAKER_07:  is \nSPEAKER_07:  Are you getting commission or feedler back? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I'm seeing it. \nSPEAKER_05:  or the zoom means okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, I think the Zoom means okay. So at this time, there's no public comment. So we can move on to the motion vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  at the center. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do we have a motion to approve the recommendation? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I would, I missed your, Commissioner Feedler was going to make a comment and would like to have the benefit of that comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  with \nSPEAKER_07:  in that comment. What we can do is go on to the next item. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I hope for the day it gets back. \nSPEAKER_02:  I didn't have the comment to learn. Yeah, okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, okay, go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  Why don't we wait till we come back with the beat? Okay. So I can take a hit here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we're going to table this item for now. I don't have to do a vote on that, do I, Taylor? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. We're going to go to item number five, recommendation to conduct a study session to discuss the November 12th, 2022 memorandum entitled Notice of Allegations of the City's Ethics Policy. \nSPEAKER_07:  regarding the conduct of certain councilmen. Actually, you know what? I don't think I want to do that one, because I'd rather have Commissioner Fiedler here. Is he back? \nSPEAKER_07:  Whoa, look, I still want enough. That's okay to worry about it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm back. That's okay. That's okay. We're in. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's the neck kind of day. Connection. Connection issue. I'm back. \nSPEAKER_07:  next kind of day. Your here. \nSPEAKER_07:  You had a comment that you were going to make before you froze. \nSPEAKER_03:  I did, I'm sorry, that was just wonderful timing, wasn't it? \nSPEAKER_03:  very briefly I think this has come up in a few different contexts that at previous meetings discussions on this issue. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  it. \nSPEAKER_03:  trying to \nSPEAKER_03:  strike a tricky balance here acknowledging that there's no perfect fit. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that the best solution in that situation where somebody comes to you with a concern. \nSPEAKER_03:  and is hesitant to share that concern. \nSPEAKER_03:  to the extent that their name has to be attached to a public disclosure. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city has \nSPEAKER_03:  various channels. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  or \nSPEAKER_03:  sharing concerns. \nSPEAKER_03:  whether they're reporting specific violations or allegations of \nSPEAKER_03:  misconduct or just a larger \nSPEAKER_03:  a more opaque general concern with something. \nSPEAKER_03:  for doing so anonymously. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  I would direct that person. \nSPEAKER_03:  to those available reporting channels in that situation if they are so concerned about having their name shared. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  in connection with the comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, again, I don't think that's a reason to abandon or substantially alter this policy. I think that that's the work around and that the rest of the policy is meant to kind of capture more broadly. \nSPEAKER_03:  certain baseline factual information about more contacts than are otherwise disclosed current. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you, Commissioner Feedler. Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, just two things first. I want to thank Commissioner Feedler for going through each of those and explaining how. \nSPEAKER_01:  how the policy is intended to apply or not apply to them. And it's clear that both Commissioner Feedler and Commissioner Shatwell \nSPEAKER_01:  spent a lot of time in the wording of this and I really, really respect that and I'm grateful for it. The other thing I have to say and this might be, well this is based on experience as I've had to. I do think it is possible for the press to ask questions in a way that feel as though it certainly feel to the receiver as though they are trying to influence the commission. And that would be when they would be speaking to us perhaps about something that is pending that we are going to consider or is going to come back in front of us. And \nSPEAKER_01:  disclosing those since their intent is disclosing those contents doesn't necessarily bother me. But I do think it could be the subject of this perhaps. So I think the point is that there's a line that's difficult to find here. And I think assuming we adopt this now, I hope that in the future that other commissioners that come after us and that perhaps look at this and want to know what it means have the benefit of hearing some of these discussions or some of these examples because I think it might be useful to them as they go through their work. So those are my comments. Thanks. Anyone else? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, and JT there's still no one for public comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_07:  Can I have a motion to adopt the... \nSPEAKER_07:  resolution. \nSPEAKER_07:  as amended. \nSPEAKER_07:  As amended. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feedler, can I put you down as the second? \nSPEAKER_03:  You may. I'll second. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so I have a motion by Commissioner Shotwell and a second by Commissioner Fiedler. JT, would you please call the roll? \nSPEAKER_06:  Come and share it already. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'mured. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Come with your heat lurks. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Mr. Steinwell. \nSPEAKER_06:  I Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Nice job, Paul. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  motion here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you very much to Commissioner Schottwollen, Commissioner Feedler for the excellent work on that. \nSPEAKER_07:  and your thoughtfulness in pulling it together. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, the next item is item five, recommendation to conduct a study session to discuss the October 12, 2022 memorandum titled Notice of Allegace alleged violations of the city's ethics."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the next item is a recommendation to continue the study session to discuss the October 12, 2022 Memorandum titled Notice of Alleged Violations on the City's ethics policy regarding the conduct of certain council members. And to kind of facilitate our discussion as we move through this item, I'd like to open with a motion for our consideration and then we can give there's a second we can go forward but either way we'll go forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the second. \nSPEAKER_06:  I move based on the information provided to the commission and under the commission's limited authority to recommend to the city council that Mayor Richardson and council member Austin are Centered for violating the city's ethics policy and speaking on behalf of the city council without authorization of the city council and Because such communications by candidates in advertising and public service announcements During an election cycle creates the impression that the city supports the council members respective candidacies \nSPEAKER_06:  Would anyone like to second? \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair. Yes. I second I also \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Also, I will heartedly agree with you in concur. I also... \nSPEAKER_01:  like some of the recommendations offered by Council on \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm losing my spot on speaking to some of the recommendations to clarify. \nSPEAKER_01:  and put in writing. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it was to amend the \nSPEAKER_01:  So make it help me. \nSPEAKER_02:  amend the chapter in the municipal code related to mass mailings and include revision. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's kind of our KX in 1992 that that would be helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  to avoid this possibly in the future. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't need to add that to the motion though, do we? \nSPEAKER_06:  a recommendation that the city update those. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Domenodictus was that your intent to ask for a friendly to \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, and \nSPEAKER_02:  and amendment to \nSPEAKER_02:  two \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  The session is escaping me. \nSPEAKER_01:  the section is \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  That was my intention. \nSPEAKER_01:  That was my intention. In addition to the chairs. \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendation to censure. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  to make to adopt those changes. I think that they're very good. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. So the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  The friendly amendment would be \nSPEAKER_06:  to add and to recommend to the city that it update. \nSPEAKER_06:  the section that Taylor referenced. \nSPEAKER_06:  one. \nSPEAKER_02:  point two. \nSPEAKER_06:  2.6 in the municipal code 1.26 in the municipal code. I'll accept that as a friendly amendment. \nSPEAKER_02:  And just to clarify for the record, the change that you would like made to 1.26 is to add a prohibition on public service announcements from the time that a incumbent candidate files their nomination paperwork. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  that is correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. JT, can you please include that as part of the motion? Yes. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  There any other discussion on this item? \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you share them with us? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. I have some questions starting with what was asked for at the last meeting and that is we had asked that there be a report to the city council about these violations and to see what they. You know, if there was any response from them about that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the request of the commission was for my office to report to the city council. After an internal discussion, my office feels that it acted appropriately. It was intentionally sent to this commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  for this commission to review whether or not there was a violation of the ethics policy and whether a policy change was necessary. The other violation that had been brought up by the chair, I believe, regarding equity and human relations commissioners, was a different issue altogether. That's why it was sent to their commission. So this is before you, just for you guys to make the decision or not on whether or not censorship was appropriate, whether or not the municipal code should be amended in a recommendation is necessary. This commission by making that recommendation \nSPEAKER_02:  The \nSPEAKER_02:  Now Mayor and Councilmember Austin, our censured could send requests to send the entire packet on behalf of the commission to the City Council as we discuss via email today. \nSPEAKER_02:  This commission is an advisory commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a provision in the charter that prevents the commission from directing other departments, including my department. So you can always make the request for something to happen. It doesn't mean that we are obligated to make that request. So like I said, I like to reiterate my office feels like it. \nSPEAKER_02:  acted appropriately based off of what the violations were and does not intend to send. \nSPEAKER_02:  the memo to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Can you tell me? \nSPEAKER_05:  If the City Council knows about this, have they been formally advised? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  formally advised I don't believe so. \nSPEAKER_02:  Some of them may know. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_02:  but whether they were formally advised, I don't believe so. \nSPEAKER_05:  And when did the city attorney's office get the complaint? \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe in early September, I'll have to check. The opinion was in September. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm assuming it's around that time. I would have to check our records. \nSPEAKER_05:  And when did the city attorney's office discover that council member Austin had apparently the original complaint was about Vice Mayor Richardson? When did the city council get to find out about the- \nSPEAKER_05:  PSA that Council Member Austin had done. \nSPEAKER_02:  at the time. Are you asking when my office found out? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. At the time that we looked into the videos that featured Council, it was Vice Mayor Richardson at the time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Did your office talk to the firefighters group at all about this? \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe the former city attorney \nSPEAKER_02:  Charlie Parkin spoke with all three of them. I was not privy to those discussions. I can't to speak to what was discussed. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I am asked the city attorney yesterday, whether there was report for us on this because we had asked specifically for it and we didn't get any report back in this item in the agenda. \nSPEAKER_05:  I also asked what the city council's procedures were. \nSPEAKER_05:  about \nSPEAKER_05:  censure. \nSPEAKER_05:  My understanding of the process of censures is that it usually is a body itself, censures its members. And I could only remember one at the time in my own recollection, which was back in the 90s. And I was referred to one in 2018. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that was when a member of the council was censured. So I looked back at the \nSPEAKER_05:  agenda items when that happened. \nSPEAKER_05:  And in that case, the motion for censure came from 4CD Council members. It was based on \nSPEAKER_05:  police reports that had been obtained and apparently reviewed when the matter was called \nSPEAKER_05:  at the City Council meeting. All the City Council members were present, including the person that was the subject of the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  that person first addressed the council and apologized and went on to explain about \nSPEAKER_05:  her personal history and then when I to recommend that \nSPEAKER_05:  and FX Commission be established and a lot of other things like that. When the motion was passed, \nSPEAKER_05:  The vote was eight to nothing and the person who was the subject of the motion abstained from the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  The memo, supporting it said that that was only the second time in \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  since the 1990s that the censure had been used by the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  and at the other time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Like I said, the one in 2018 involved conduct that was the subject of police reports, the one in 1993 involved \nSPEAKER_05:  offensive and harassing and discriminatory comments by a city council member in the city council meeting as I recall it regarding persons of certain sexual orientation. And the city council chose to discipline their member with with censure. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think the City Council needs to look at this and decide how they think their members should be disciplined and governed. I have trouble saying it should be censured because it appears to me that that has been used in cases where everyone witnessed it or in a case where there was police investigation and the person being, you know, accused. I think that has been accused, you know, had an opportunity to. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  to give a big explanation. We haven't seen the complaints. We haven't had a chance to talk to the people. We haven't gotten a report from the city, from the city attorney about the investigation that was done. Maybe the city council, I think the city council can be suggested to look into disciplining themselves. And maybe it'll be that they wanna do citations or they wanna do reprimands. They wanna do censures. Maybe they wanna ask for expulsion or suspension. I do not know. But... \nSPEAKER_05:  from what I can tell, there isn't anything very internal at the city council level about governing themselves. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm not comfortable with the way that the motion is worded and that's partly because we do not have Investatory power and we don't not have disciplinary power and the item that we're going to discuss next Is it compared is the powers that we have to the powers that other commissions have and every commission that has power to discipline Also has a power to do investigation and this commission does not it does not have that power I also there was some commentary by the \nSPEAKER_05:  the press about this item after we discussed it the last time. We've had no public comment at these meetings about any of this. So it's just been us talking about it. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  And the comment raised the possibility that there should be a more public facing way that these complaints are handled. And I am very concerned about that. I think we actually should be having a subcommittee once we have enough members that aren't already on subcommittees to look into this to look more specifically for specific recommendations. Perhaps in addition to the ones that are in \nSPEAKER_05:  in this memo and I think we should be looking at what the overall process is for these types of complaints. In May during the primary election, \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  As soon as a few candidates that were not elected were charged with not having filled out their financial forms correctly, the City Attorney's Office was on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  and everyone learned about it. And that didn't happen with this. And I just concerned that we haven't completely \nSPEAKER_05:  Exhausted this so I'm fine going back. It's telling the City Council. I thought that's what we had already done I didn't necessarily think that we were asking the City Attorney's Office to do it. I just thought staff was gonna say \nSPEAKER_05:  Hey, did you guys know these items are coming before us? These are the reports from the attorneys. You know, you should look at them and see what the council did. \nSPEAKER_05:  We asked for that in November. We asked for it in December. If it doesn't happen. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm okay saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we, I'm not comfortable saying censure this person. I'm comfortable saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  Please look into this because you have two members who appear to have violated the rules that you have for themselves and that you've set up for yourself and in whatever way you think is appropriate and see what the council does. In the meantime, perhaps we can come up with in addition to these things, suggestions for all commissions about how they internally manage. \nSPEAKER_05:  the conduct of each other. \nSPEAKER_05:  in connection with the things that they have, the rules that they've imposed upon themselves or for conduct among themselves. So those are, I think that's all my comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm sorry. It's not public comment time yet. We'll call on you when it's time for public comment, okay? If you just wait, just wait, this is our time to talk first. And then we'll have public comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  that public. \nSPEAKER_06:  Anyone else on the commission have comments? \nSPEAKER_06:  questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would just say I hear your concern, Commissioner Weiss, but we are not mandating. As you said, we do not have investigatory powers. We do not have the authority to direct discipline. So that's why this motion says that we recommend to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  I will say honestly I've struggled with it over the last few months also. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if you take it out of the realm of the campaign. \nSPEAKER_06:  and just deal with the ethics violation. I think it's something that definitely we should have a word in. Because the city's ethics, not the code that we adopted, but the one that was in place that we were revising, specifically said that you were not supposed to speak on the city's behalf without specific authorization. I will say I had some conversations with Taylor over the last month to ask some questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  to make sure that I could get to a place where I was comfortable in recommending censure and one of them was asking if anyone had gone back and looked at the council records to make sure that they were not authorized to speak on the city's behalf and I was advised that the former city attorney who attended all the meetings reviewed everything \nSPEAKER_06:  could not recall an instance where they were advised that they were given authorization to speak on the city's behalf and that the two subjects of the situation \nSPEAKER_06:  have been advised of the situation and did not come forward with any documentation showing that they have been given authorization from the city to speak on their behalf. \nSPEAKER_06:  My other concern was how does this council's censure the person who was currently the mayor? First, the behavior that occurred when he was a council member and the vice mayor. And what I was advised by Taylor and Taylor correct me if I get this wrong was that they will be, if they choose to follow this path, they don't have to do anything when they get this report from us. But if they choose to follow this path, they would be censoring him in his role as the city council member. \nSPEAKER_06:  not in his current position. \nSPEAKER_06:  So with that said and knowing that we don't have \nSPEAKER_06:  investigative, but it's kind of black and white. What was provided, we were provided copies of the video. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think for us to not speak on a violation of the city's ethics policies. \nSPEAKER_06:  when it's an elected official. \nSPEAKER_06:  says volumes and weakens our credibility. We've talked long and hard about looking at everything through an ethical lens. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  So I as much as it pains me because these are two members who have supported us very, very, very solidly. So I like to think that they're ethical all the time. But I think this shows that they're human and sometimes we make mistakes. And I think. \nSPEAKER_06:  As it goes forward, it shows that people need to start contacting Heather and Julian also to kind of ask questions and make sure that you're really asking questions before you do something. So that was why I felt comfortable making this motion at this time. \nSPEAKER_06:  I ask you all to vote your conscience. We don't always have to be uniform in how we vote. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if no one else has any comments, I'm going to call, but you have a comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well \nSPEAKER_03:  to the point on censure. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was not aware of how rarely center has been used. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I wonder if we could modify the motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  to say \nSPEAKER_03:  potential discipline. \nSPEAKER_03:  up to an including possible center. \nSPEAKER_02:  So if I may on this one. \nSPEAKER_02:  um, censure \nSPEAKER_02:  without \nSPEAKER_02:  criminal enforcement for conduct which wouldn't be appropriate here or administrative enforcement which there isn't a mechanism to do that or reporting to the FPPC which they're not going to care about this because it's a local issue. \nSPEAKER_02:  There is no other mechanism besides censure and public acknowledgment that the conduct of a member of a body was inappropriate, at least in the opinion of the body. \nSPEAKER_02:  or that the body disagreed with the conduct. \nSPEAKER_02:  because they're all elected. And because they're elected. \nSPEAKER_02:  They're put in by the people. They're accountable to the people. So if the people disagree with the way that an elected official is behaving in office, that elected official can be recalled. And there's a process for that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So why there are less centers in the city? I can't answer that question, but I can answer why center. \nSPEAKER_02:  is the only kind of mechanism that the City Council has for this if they want to reprimand one of its members. \nSPEAKER_06:  If the members are not comfortable with censure. \nSPEAKER_06:  Vote this motion down. \nSPEAKER_06:  If the motion fails, there's no reason that somebody couldn't make a subsequent motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  directing a letter be sent to the City Council acknowledging that this inappropriate behavior happened. \nSPEAKER_06:  and ask and reminding them about appropriate policy and letting them know that in the future we would recommend we might recommend censure. \nSPEAKER_02:  So what I would recommend instead if there is a member of this body that feels the original motion \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  They don't agree with the original motion. It would be better to make a substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. And then what the commission would do is they would vote on the last motion first. I'm going to try and explain this in the least confusing way. So the new motion, the substitute motion would get voted on first. If that motion passes, we never consider the second. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  If that motion fails, we consider \nSPEAKER_02:  The original motion if that motion fails \nSPEAKER_00:  the original. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're done. \nSPEAKER_02:  And if someone wants to bring or the chair proposed to the chair that we bring another item later on. \nSPEAKER_02:  to recommend the changes to the municipal code. We could bring a separate item at that time to make for you guys have the opportunity to give that feedback. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I can't make the substitute motion because I was near the maker of the motion. Correct. So I did not make that. \nSPEAKER_02:  You're the maker of the motion. Correct. So it would need to be another commissioner. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner.. Joshua! \nSPEAKER_07:  I don't know if now is the appropriate time to speak or not, but um... \nSPEAKER_07:  What is the true two questions? What is the true effect of censor? And I'm really torn on this issue, and it's really more of a question for Taylor, is I'm very concerned that we are just an advisory commission. We do not have investigatory authority into what it is appropriate, as much as I agree with the substance, as it is appropriate for us to take an action like this, or is it really beyond really what our duties are as a commission, or can we square them within the duties, given the fact that maybe characterizing it advisory and asking the city council to take action. So hopefully that was clear. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in your first point, the point of a censure is a public acknowledgement that the conduct of one of its members, that the body doesn't agree with it, that it was either wrong \nSPEAKER_02:  outside of the mission of what, you know, the commission is, that's the issue that we're having with the equity and human relations commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, holding yourselves out in the community in a certain way. So it's a public acknowledgement that the behavior of one of the commissioners, that the body doesn't agree with it. Whatever that conduct was, illegal or not. \nSPEAKER_02:  to your second question about the authority. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  You are making a recommendation. You're not taking action. \nSPEAKER_02:  I was provided direction to send this to you. \nSPEAKER_02:  by the city attorney. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  There was an opinion that you guys have the ability at least to make a recommendation on on what can occur. You can't require something to occur. You can't mandate something to occur. You can't call anybody before the body. You can't subpoena them. So it is a recommendation, like the chair said. \nSPEAKER_02:  And those types of things and ethical conduct that's still within your authority. And we've had the discussion with the chair and the vice chair if these types of issues. \nSPEAKER_02:  are not of interest to the commission and you guys don't want these types of things to come to you. That's perfectly okay. I can report back to my office and let them know. I just need a consensus that that's not what you guys want to do. \nSPEAKER_07:  I will just add, no, I do, I will just say that I do think it is appropriate for these items to be brought to our attention. \nSPEAKER_05:  Comment your wax. Yeah. Well, to that comment first, I will say. \nSPEAKER_05:  I certainly think that this discussion is showing that we are very interested in this and that we are very concerned about how these complaints are handled. Also I was \nSPEAKER_05:  I do not think that I had ever heard until I \nSPEAKER_05:  chair Morales just said it that there had been a dialogue between the City Attorney's Office and the and Vice Mayor Richardson and Austin and that they didn't I don't know that they didn't respond in a certain way or or something like that. That's exactly the kind of information that I think the commission needs to have and it needs to be in a report to us not \nSPEAKER_05:  We don't just hear that the other person talked to the, you know, ask the right question of the city attorney to get that information. I feel like that's the information that should be coming to us. I just. \nSPEAKER_05:  I love you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's how commissioners waste, if I may. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Sarah. \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the things that has come out of this item, I had a discussion with the current city attorney. Part of my mandate before the next election is to create a process internally. So at least for election-related complaints, because as we've discussed, multiple occasions. This year, for some reason, there was an onslaught of election violations. It was not typical for my office. So moving forward, we are going to draft a policy of how those complaints are received and managed, and who they should be sent to, and when, so that there is more transparency moving forward, at least in relation to \nSPEAKER_02:  election violations. There's some problem with us being transparent about all ethics violations in the city Just because some of them can be personnel issues where there's a public interest in the election violations and my office Recognizes that so we are working on a way to improve the current process and Definitely looking at what happened this past election season so that we can do better in 2024 \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  that one. that one that one the finance \nSPEAKER_05:  I really am glad to hear that and \nSPEAKER_05:  And at least I'll say for myself as a member of this commission that's exactly some of the ways that I think the ethics commission could could help. And that's what I was trying to say when I expanded on the things that I thought we should be looking at is how are these complaints going to be handled? How are they going to become known to the public? \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's exactly, I mean, that falls right within what the responsibilities of this commission are, is to provide ideas and recommendations like that. So please don't act in a silo. Please include the commission in that process. I feel like I'm begging for this almost. And I don't like having to like pry out information. And that is the way that I've been made to feel about this. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't think that's fair to the city attorney's office. \nSPEAKER_05:  anyway. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we are all learning in this process. I think if you go back to what she said, this was an unusual election cycle. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  without having faced it before and not having had an ethics commission before. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we are all doing the best that we can and like everything else that we're doing, we're creating processes as we go. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I don't think anyone is trying to hide information from you or anyone else. And, you know, on quite honestly, I thought of some of the questions that I asked on the fly afterwards. And it was not my intent not to share that with you, but as you know, we cannot contact each other in between meetings. So the only opportunity I have is when I'm speaking up here. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  I didn't mean to offend. I'm expressing my own frustration and concern about this. And I apologize if I did offend anybody by the way I phrased it. So my apologies. I would like to offer a substitute motion at this time. And I would like to suggest that the motion be that we recommend to the City Council that they consider disciplining. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councilmember Austin and Vice Mayor Richardson for the items that have been brought to our attention in these reports. As far as the second part of the motion which had to do with making these recommendations, I would prefer that we could report to them if that's appropriate that we plan to be looking at ways to improve or make recommendations for the municipal code section 1.26 and other other items relating to the election process with the assistance of an input from the city attorney's office. Some more along the lines of what's the third bullet point in the memo of October 12th. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  So I'd just like to clarify, we discussed earlier, there is no other disciplinary action that the council can take against. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilmember Austin and now Mayor Richardson. Censure is the only mechanism that the council has available to them. The FBPC didn't take action. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have no other way to... \nSPEAKER_02:  enforce what's occurred against Councilmember Austin and now Mayor Richardson. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's... \nSPEAKER_05:  It's censored ever mentioned in the city charter. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  No, it doesn't have to be. It's in Roberts Rules of Order, which is incorporated into the conduct of the City Council in the municipal code. \nSPEAKER_05:  We can't the City Council develop its own discipline process quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  If they choose, I mean, could they choose something other than come up with something? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that that would be problematic because they wouldn't have investigatory authority to explore. \nSPEAKER_02:  So they would be provided the same information that you're being provided to determine whether a center is appropriate because \nSPEAKER_02:  two of its members spoke. \nSPEAKER_02:  without the permission of the body. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll then let them make that decision. \nSPEAKER_05:  They can be advised by you as to what they can do and what they can't do and they can ask all the questions they want and they can ask for further investigation or whatever they want to do. I'm just saying what I mean. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just saying that what you're asking for isn't possible. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right? So what the current motion on the floor? \nSPEAKER_02:  That is an action that is possible of the council. At this point, we're at the end of the road on the actions that can be taken for these violations. \nSPEAKER_02:  The things that can happen are we amend the municipal code to prevent this in the future and that there is an enforcement mechanism for when this type of thing in a gray area occurs. And even with that, we could maybe add an enforcement tool, right, for violations of that section, maybe administrative citations because criminal citations prove problematic. The FBPC won't take these types of violations. But there's no other discipline that the city council can put onto its members beyond censure. \nSPEAKER_00:  The thing. \nSPEAKER_02:  And like I said, Seniors just a public acknowledgement. \nSPEAKER_02:  that the contact of one of its members, the rest of the body doesn't agree with it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Are you comfortable that Robert's rules of order? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_05:  would not allow this. \nSPEAKER_05:  would not allow a discipline. I don't know what other discipline not allow them to issue something like a reprimand if they that's what a censure is. \nSPEAKER_02:  would not allow a discipline. I don't know what other discipline. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think they're good. \nSPEAKER_05:  It has a different meaning to me. I'll say that. I haven't done all the research on Roberts Rules of Order. So I looked up one set of Roberts Rules of Order and Shenzhen was not used as a specific term. It was given as an example of things that could be done. It wasn't used. I didn't search Roberts Rules of Order for the word refer-man or discipline or things like that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So at this point, I've advised you on what I feel that the City Council can do. If you would like to continue with your motion, you are welcome to do so. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we say? \nSPEAKER_03:  take action. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then the City Council can determine that censure is the only action they have available to them. \nSPEAKER_02:  That would be a possibility. \nSPEAKER_02:  That would be fine with me. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So what if we made that a friendly \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  So what if we made that a friendly amendment to the first motion? \nSPEAKER_05:  to recommend it. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we changed the wording from censure. \nSPEAKER_05:  to take action. \nSPEAKER_06:  to take action. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's fine. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd say to consider taking action. That's how I would, that was what my substitute motion was. Consider taking action. I'm not going to, I am not comfortable telling them what to do because I haven't been able to investigate. I haven't been able to talk to them. I haven't been able to ask to get answers to all the questions that I would like the answers that I would like the answers to before I vote on censure. So if I were sitting on the city council, I think I would ask some of those questions or try to get that information. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  can see it. \nSPEAKER_00:  So let's go. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  So be consider taking action or consider taking appropriate action. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  that appropriate action be taken. \nSPEAKER_03:  that the City Council take appropriate action with regard to Mayor Richardson and Council member Austin for violating the City's ethics policies and speaking on the act. \nSPEAKER_05:  So to recommend of the City Council that they consider taking action against \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Austin and Richardson Fuller. \nSPEAKER_05:  the items identified in the in this report that we did receive. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, we would go with the rest of the motion. I would accept. \nSPEAKER_06:  that change that advice chair came up with. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  as a friendly amendment. \nSPEAKER_03:  as a friendly \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm uncomfortable saying everything in the report. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks for your time. You should turn on your mic please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. No, no. The rest of the motion would stay the same. \nSPEAKER_06:  The friendly amendment would be that the changes \nSPEAKER_06:  based on \nSPEAKER_06:  The information provided the commission and under the commission's limited authority. We recommend that the city council take appropriate action. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  for Mayor Richardson and Council Member Austen's violation of the city's ethics policy and speaking on behalf. So the rest of it would stay the same. \nSPEAKER_06:  Everything else would stay the same. We would just take out the center word and it would become taking action. I think we did commission to be benedictus. A second who seconded that with me. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, she was a seconder. \nSPEAKER_06:  commissionative benefits are you okay with? \nSPEAKER_01:  that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Friendly, I'm not supportive of that at all. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think \nSPEAKER_01:  I like your original proposal. \nSPEAKER_01:  I go back to my original reading of this in October, the opinions that were laid out are City Guide. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we've all supported. We've introduced to the elected, etc. I could go on and on, but I think the opinions, the information, the video is on its face. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I am so pleased that Council \nSPEAKER_01:  brought it to our commission to weigh in. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, I've heard I understand the \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  the desire to investigate, but in this case, this is not the type of thing that I think requires that. I do believe that I'm glad to hear the information that the two principals Austin and Richardson, the fact that they did not respond also is on its face. I \nSPEAKER_01:  I really I do think it is our job. It is an important thing. I'm happy to hear that the council is also going to develop a process for the future. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I think given what is before us. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the city guide. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's where we are duty. \nSPEAKER_01:  two \nSPEAKER_01:  I identified that this is a violation and I am listening to the opinions. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think censure is appropriate. \nSPEAKER_01:  And as we know, \nSPEAKER_01:  Council's also told us that they may come back with alternative and that is fine. \nSPEAKER_08:  Theys are shot well. \nSPEAKER_04:  ...bean shrimps. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sure I'm going to get a chance to see what you're going to see. Thank you. I'm going to see what you can do. Thank you. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you. And I'm also going to be taking it to the next report. I'm going to be back. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Oh, I'm going to be back. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I saw that Commissioner Norby has handed. Oh, I just want to show you something. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, sorry, I just want to make sure you sign it. Sorry, Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's okay, that's okay. Thank you, Chair. I have a question. \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe \nSPEAKER_00:  Taylor will be able to answer it. Taylor, if you don't mind. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  If this passes the recommendation, \nSPEAKER_00:  to the council. \nSPEAKER_00:  It doesn't mean that council. \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll take any action, is that correct? \nSPEAKER_02:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the way that your recommendations will be transmitted to council is by memo from with the assistance of Julian and Heather. That memo will be made available on a public facing website. Council and their staff all receive those memos. Then what would have to occur is \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe four council members would have to sign on to one item to get it agendized to have a discussion on this. So no, they do not have to take action. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. That's all right, bye. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_07:  So at the present, are we looking for a second for Commissioner of Wises? \nSPEAKER_06:  No, we were looking. I was asked, I, quite honestly, I feel more comfortable going forward. I was trying to find a compromise here, but if my second is not, is gonna hold firm, I'm gonna hold firm then also. \nSPEAKER_06:  unless she comes up with a substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  than she would need. Well, the back to her original one, when it says discipline, then yes, we are looking for a second. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. I'm really glad to hear that. \nSPEAKER_06:  my hand I don't know but hold on I think to where you can finish the shot we're gonna second her substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_07:  One note so that does not clear it was the first motion. So then the only thing it would be this is second, the first motion that Commissioner White said or the second motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  because they're friendly amendment to change censure to take action was not accepted. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner D. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_06:  Your microphone's muted. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, it really resonates with me that the \nSPEAKER_01:  providing them the option to do nothing. \nSPEAKER_01:  not to say that they would. I think that this is... \nSPEAKER_01:  Knowing the records and the types of people that were I think this is going to be \nSPEAKER_01:  and important. \nSPEAKER_01:  item for them to consider. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I like that you have put forward the thoughts, the next steps that are likely to impact and when giving the timing of this and when it occurred and their roles. What would be centered. I think that this is an important thing for us to do. And \nSPEAKER_01:  It lays the groundwork for future work. I think that that's probably the most important thing to me. \nSPEAKER_06:  Anyone else have any comments? \nSPEAKER_05:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm not sure where we are because I thought I had made a motion and then I made a substitute and then vice chair Pollock suggested some different language for the substitute motion. And I think that's where we left off on the substitute. So there's no say. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for your attention. \nSPEAKER_06:  So there's no second for the substitute motion. So your substitute motion dies for lack of a second. \nSPEAKER_06:  and your friendly amendment was not accepted. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we are at the original motion as presented. \nSPEAKER_07:  Could we have the subsequent motion restated? \nSPEAKER_06:  the substitute motion. If you'd like to restate your substitute motion, Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. I'm going to go with the language that Commissioner Pollock had suggested which was to recommend the City Council consider taking action on the \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  the parent alleged violations by Commissioner or Councilmember Austin and Vice Mayor Richardson regarding the PSAs and speaking on behalf of the City Council without authorization and creating the impression that the city supported their candidates. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would second that motion questioning only if we should add then before vice mayor Richardson. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there any discussion on the motion on the floor? \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_04:  At this time, if you'd like to speak on this item, please approach the podium or raise your hand in the Zoom meeting. \nSPEAKER_08:  A year's back, I did everything except ship. And as you may know, I... \nSPEAKER_08:  as far as having the \nSPEAKER_08:  the platform and the technology and the support. \nSPEAKER_08:  and also the instruction, the proper instructions and whatnot to ship everyone. That didn't have to be- Sorry to interrupt, couldn't have stayed- I learned to- \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm sorry to interrupt. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  It would just be close to yeah, the commissioners on line are having a hard time hearing you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. And \nSPEAKER_08:  I would, at some point, you know, I would like to be able to return to work. \nSPEAKER_08:  because I did hold a career and very good job. And I did raise my child who's an adult now. \nSPEAKER_08:  And so I would like the opportunity in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  maybe South Long Beach. At some point, whenever you all say it's okay to do so. And, \nSPEAKER_08:  And I know that I would be able to provide, like I was saying a little bit earlier. \nSPEAKER_08:  quality feedback and whatnot in in regard to \nSPEAKER_08:  members or the \nSPEAKER_08:  the buys that come back to the city. So \nSPEAKER_08:  So I just wanted to add that. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for your comments. This commission has no role in hiring. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you for your comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, maybe you could have a conversation so she doesn't have to stay for the rest of the meeting. She has that place to go on how to contact human resources about jobs. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll do it. \nSPEAKER_06:  do you see anyone online. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, that concludes both of them. \nSPEAKER_06:  You want to call the roll on the substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_04:  \u3054\u8996\u8074\u306e\u5834\u5408\u3002 \nSPEAKER_00:  abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Dave and Adictus. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, Commissioner Dave Van Dijk just was the... \nSPEAKER_01:  of whichever's appropriate name or abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, sorry. I could have been here. \nSPEAKER_01:  appreciate you hail Bets. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Feeder? Commissioner, shot well. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner White. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  FINlich r320 sure \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Charlie violence. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  mission in Norway you want to \nSPEAKER_06:  for Norway you want to stay in a stain or do you want to vote yes or no. \nSPEAKER_00:  abstain. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. So we have \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, are we allowed to abstain? Yes. I thought I remembered from... \nSPEAKER_05:  from when \nSPEAKER_05:  Amy Weber was in the in Taylor seat that people were not allowed to abstain. That's why I'm asking if they were present. \nSPEAKER_02:  to my knowledge. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know why? \nSPEAKER_02:  I hate to say this, I don't know off the top of my head, I will have to look at it quickly. GT, can you tell me what the mode is? \nSPEAKER_04:  The vote is 3-2. \nSPEAKER_06:  So three yes, two no one abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  We \nSPEAKER_02:  to get free to freezest. Sure. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  It's in art, like it's in art. Is it in art? I'm looking for it. \nSPEAKER_06:  is it in our \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, JT had stained her there, nobody said anything. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Remember of the commission who is present when a roll call is called shall vote for or against the question \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Norvey, you're going to have to vote up or down. \nSPEAKER_06:  You can only abstain, Commissioner Norvay, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Norvey doesn't have his speaker on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh no. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, Commissioner Norvey? \nSPEAKER_06:  It appears we have a rule in our bylaws about voting. \nSPEAKER_06:  Taylor's going to read it, but \nSPEAKER_06:  While you're thinking you're going to have to vote yes or no. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in section 9.3.3 for abstentions except when a conflict exists and its extension is required. Every member of the commission who is present when a role call is called, shall vote for or against the question unless excused by a majority of the commission members present prior to the calling of the role on such questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Norvey, how do you vote? \nSPEAKER_00:  No. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, in that case the motion fails because it's deadlocked. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we go back to the original motion, unless somebody else has another substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Could you repeat the motion then please? \nSPEAKER_06:  Sure. J.K. Can you? \nSPEAKER_06:  call read it back because I don't have the language on the \nSPEAKER_06:  the changes we were going to make in the municipal code. \nSPEAKER_02:  I can do you have it, Chiti? \nSPEAKER_04:  No, you can. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the chair moved based on the information provided to the commission and under the commission's limited authority to recommend to the city council that Mayor Richardson and council member Austin are censored for violating the city's ethics policies and speaking on behalf of the city council without authorization of the city council. And because such communications by candidates in advertisements and public service announcements during an election cycle create the impression that the city supports the council members respective candidates and \nSPEAKER_02:  to recommend to amend Long Beach Municipal Code 1.26 to include a blackout period for public service announcements of incumbent candidates from the time they file nomination papers. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any further questions? \nSPEAKER_06:  their discussion. \nSPEAKER_06:  on the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm just going to say for the record that I do not have enough information at this time to vote on this, to vote on this, but I understand I have to vote. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  comment \nSPEAKER_04:  At this time if you'd like to speak please use the raised hand feature in the zoom meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing none, that concludes by the comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm going to call it the vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  communications. \nSPEAKER_00:  No. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner David and Degrees. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner shocked well. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_05:  today. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks, Chair Powell. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I think that was probably one of the most challenging discussions we've had in our short tenure. And I want to thank everyone for being thoughtful and. \nSPEAKER_06:  And it's expressive. It's important that we be able to disagree sometimes and move forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the staff will take care of sending that. Then it's 5 o'clock. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't have a lot of time limit except that Taylor has to leave us a little before 6. So we're going to play with the agenda."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  Okay, item six is a recommendation to receive and file a report from the ad hoc committee on the development of an ethics program motto and to adopt a recommendation of two or three models for city employees to vote on. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are you taking that or is one of the commissioners? \nSPEAKER_03:  alert. \nSPEAKER_03:  commissioners. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  We had a fun time with this. \nSPEAKER_00:  project I would say. \nSPEAKER_00:  First of all, I just want to acknowledge and thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  the city employees who participated. It was very helpful. \nSPEAKER_00:  and um \nSPEAKER_00:  We had a lot of suggestions. \nSPEAKER_00:  But like Heather's memo said, we narrowed them down. \nSPEAKER_00:  We were looking at a motto. \nSPEAKER_00:  symbol and a catchphrase as directed by the ethics commission and \nSPEAKER_00:  We know the suggestions down in each category. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  For the models, I think we came down with. \nSPEAKER_00:  Anchor to ethics, navigating ethics together. \nSPEAKER_00:  Follow your ethical compass. \nSPEAKER_00:  Ethics starts here. \nSPEAKER_00:  or ethics starts you. \nSPEAKER_00:  or ethics starts with me. \nSPEAKER_00:  For the symbols, we were looking at anchor. \nSPEAKER_00:  kind of a wave \nSPEAKER_00:  a symbol of an open book. \nSPEAKER_00:  Lighthouse \nSPEAKER_00:  All three much representative of \nSPEAKER_00:  a city like Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  which is on \nSPEAKER_00:  near the water. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we were looking at catchphrases. \nSPEAKER_00:  But in the end, we decided to go the catchphrase at this time. \nSPEAKER_00:  personally. \nSPEAKER_00:  There were so many suggestions. \nSPEAKER_00:  that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I started to \nSPEAKER_00:  I started to think about the best way. \nSPEAKER_00:  Qiu \nSPEAKER_00:  even narrow down. \nSPEAKER_00:  the motto is in the symbol. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I thought about our city seal. \nSPEAKER_00:  to serve as kind of \nSPEAKER_00:  a guide. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so I asked Heather to \nSPEAKER_00:  pull up the \nSPEAKER_00:  copy of the seal. \nSPEAKER_00:  and the definition. \nSPEAKER_00:  or the intent behind the seal, and that was extremely helpful. \nSPEAKER_00:  because it seems to \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  what this \nSPEAKER_00:  The definition of the seal seems to suggest similar. \nSPEAKER_00:  similar suggestions that were provided by \nSPEAKER_00:  the city employees, for example, lighthouse, breakwater, beach, a book of knowledge. \nSPEAKER_00:  a lamp of wisdom. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so when we started to look at all these terms, \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_00:  the imagery behind the terms and the significance of the seal. We started to kind of narrow down. \nSPEAKER_00:  the options that I laid out earlier. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um... \nSPEAKER_00:  I think at the end we... \nSPEAKER_00:  For me, I was looking at. \nSPEAKER_00:  ethics. \nSPEAKER_00:  Finally, like a guiding light. \nSPEAKER_00:  being navigated. \nSPEAKER_00:  should be navigated in the ocean. \nSPEAKER_00:  guided by a lighthouse. \nSPEAKER_00:  direction. \nSPEAKER_00:  Seeking guidance. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so \nSPEAKER_00:  When I saw the seal and some of the terms and the suggestions that seemed to overlap. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think that's why we narrowed it down to what you have in front of you, which is... \nSPEAKER_00:  And of course, this is just a suggestion. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Follow your ethical compass. \nSPEAKER_00:  We... \nSPEAKER_00:  We started thinking about also a \nSPEAKER_00:  Peace. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you guys. Right in front of you. \nSPEAKER_00:  a motto to include some of these symbols or these images. \nSPEAKER_00:  an idea also came up to at the bottom if this is the way the commission wants to go to put it's established 2020. \nSPEAKER_00:  City of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  But those are... \nSPEAKER_00:  Those are the suggestions that I think we came up with and that we were comfortable with passing along. \nSPEAKER_00:  in terms of the catch phrase. \nSPEAKER_00:  There were so many wonderful suggestions. \nSPEAKER_00:  But we... \nSPEAKER_00:  decided that perhaps we would. \nSPEAKER_00:  leave the catchphrase for \nSPEAKER_00:  end of \nSPEAKER_00:  independent. \nSPEAKER_00:  individual type of presentations that we or Heather may give in the future. \nSPEAKER_00:  and tailor a catch phrase for that specific type of presentation versus having a catch phrase. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  You're round. \nSPEAKER_05:  Heather. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, Commissioner Norbe did a great job of synthesizing art process. So I am really happy with \nSPEAKER_05:  The output as Commissioner Norvey stated this is just a design mockup just throwing around ideas with our designer that the ad hoc and I discussed. And he did this very quickly. So again, this is just a quick idea. But I think this sums up well the direction that commissioners, a Norvey, did been a dickless and I were going with a possible symbol. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's nice. \nSPEAKER_03:  any comments? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Go ahead, I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  I really like the following urethical compass idea and the only thing that I was thinking of is then those center lines look like the compass. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I was wondering if we could actually make the compass, that center, and then have four spaces around the compass. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  And since we're saying follow-irethical compass, then the compass itself is the central. \nSPEAKER_01:  thing that catches your eye. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I really like the others because they \nSPEAKER_01:  They fit. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the idea of a compass. You kind of want to have a compass when you're in a... \nSPEAKER_01:  boat and the lighthouse is a place that you're \nSPEAKER_01:  aiming for \nSPEAKER_01:  trying to avoid \nSPEAKER_01:  the Sun, the Book of Knowledge. I don't know what the fourth thing then would be if we put the compass in the center, and we needed a fourth quadrant. \nSPEAKER_01:  but \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, we could definitely play around with it and do different designs. I think there's an anchor that I don't see. \nSPEAKER_05:  And again, this is going back out to the city workforce for one last vote so we could send out a couple different designs. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  in addition to this one. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  See what comes back to us. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I believe follow your ethical compass and this is something that the commission may disagree with as a whole but that \nSPEAKER_05:  this ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_05:  in order to preperences the list of models you have in front of you. So navigating ethics together was their first choice, anchored in ethics, their second, follow your ethical compass, their third, and then ethics starts here or with you or with me. So the idea would be for you to maybe pick \nSPEAKER_05:  Two to three of those today and those go out to the city workforce for one for one last final vote and then we could attach some symbols. \nSPEAKER_03:  to that. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  That was going to be my question. Is are we still picking three of these to go out to the staff? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  2 to 3, it doesn't have to be 3 if you get to a point where you really like 2 but not 3, that's okay 2. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Charlotte? \nSPEAKER_06:  That would go to the entire workforce to evaluate or you have a group of people. \nSPEAKER_03:  It goes out. \nSPEAKER_05:  to the entire workforce. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a boat. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's what we could greet upon initially was that we weren't going to narrow it down to one ourselves because we wanted something that the staff feels they have buy in. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we were going to pick a couple and then let them choose the final winner. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, and I totally agree with that. I will say that I like the idea of the compass and the top three and how they tie in to both our, both the compass theme of the logo. I very much like Commissioner Pollock's idea of incorporating the compass into the lines and coming up with the fourth quadrant. I actually also like, but really reason why I raised my hand is this whole concept of ethics starts here. And actually when I first read it, \nSPEAKER_06:  I was really thinking it was all three. We're seeing ethics starts here. \nSPEAKER_06:  with you and with me and I really like that. Now I don't necessarily like it in the sense that it doesn't directly tie to the graphic but if there is a way that we can also incorporate that number four line into the messaging that might be helpful but I wouldn't pick here with you or with me I would actually do all three. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Weiss. Yeah. First, how many of the employees are participating in this? I saw there were a lot of suggestions that one sheep that you'd gone through. We got about 50. \nSPEAKER_05:  We got it. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  responses and I mean it took a little bit of time to really participate in that particular survey it was a really thoughtful \nSPEAKER_04:  God bless everyone. I love it. I know, wow. \nSPEAKER_05:  process, some of us can attest to you that. \nSPEAKER_05:  did the survey so I would expect a lot more \nSPEAKER_05:  participation only because there isn't as much time that would be committed to dissimilarity. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, okay. My other thought. \nSPEAKER_04:  I could, if it really was a compass in it, you know, bobbled around and went, you know, that would be very cool. But the other thing I thought about in the circle, but it might be too much text going around would be the values. So when your arrow went around, whatever it landed on, it would be one of our values. I mean, if you thought about it that way, so just another idea. \nSPEAKER_04:  it looks good. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. \nSPEAKER_04:  I love it. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we have four recommendations in front of us. Do we want to eliminate one or two, or do we want to go forward with all four? \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm not reading the table very well. \nSPEAKER_06:  I will say the idea of kind of engaging the city staff on this or the employees of the city on this. It's just another bite of the apple. It gets them thinking and I wouldn't be opposed to all four. \nSPEAKER_03:  to someone who want to make a motion that we go forward with all four for the city staff. \nSPEAKER_03:  So moved. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, can I motion? \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Gabbana-Dekta says that \nSPEAKER_03:  Second. Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  JT, is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_02:  No, we don't have any members of the public in the Zoom. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, you wanna call the vote? \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Nordy. I, Commissioner David and Dictus. I, Commissioner Feebl. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yours is on, cheer circle. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner White. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Nice job, Paula. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Jones.

Is Julian doing that one? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, Chair I am. So earlier this earlier, sorry, the last month, Vice Chair Pollock, Heather and I met and reviewed the action plan. So the emphasis of that meeting and you'll see here was placed really on reviewing the column titled Timeline Priority. \nSPEAKER_01:  That is something that we vice chair park wanted to focus on to make sure that \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  We reviewed each deliverable to \nSPEAKER_01:  Kind of look at it with fresh eyes and what the work that we've done and what we could anticipate doing forward \nSPEAKER_01:  So the red kind of traditional track changes is what changes that you will see are reflective based on the meeting that we had. \nSPEAKER_01:  And you'll see, like I mentioned earlier, most of the changes are affecting the timeline, priority column. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  That's kind of what with the conversation where we landed at the new timetable there and then you will see additional changes that were done in the notes and next steps column. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that also shows in red. \nSPEAKER_01:  So, you know, \nSPEAKER_01:  Just keep in mind that this we've always considered this action plan like a living document. So these are, you know, just kind of our after our conversation, kind of what we're proposing to land at the deliverables. It is ambitious, but that's something that I think is something that we do here. So vice chair Paul, anything you want to add to that or Heather? \nSPEAKER_02:  No, I mean, I think we had a good conversation. The timeline priorities keep us focused on what the priorities are. And keep us moving forward. I think the living document concept though, \nSPEAKER_02:  When we complete an item, there may be something then we want. \nSPEAKER_02:  to add further. This timeline was very focused on the audit. \nSPEAKER_02:  And there's a lot we can do beyond the audit, although obviously responding to the audit's a high priority. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh \nSPEAKER_02:  So maybe with the exception of 1.3, where we do have a value statement. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we can declare that complete. I think it'll be rare that we'll actually declare. \nSPEAKER_02:  one of the value streams complete, but rather. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll declare \nSPEAKER_02:  everything we had in there complete and then we'll look at what's next. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and just to add to that, you're sure it's something else that we also discussed, which was once something is completed, we can look at if it were moving it and adding it towards the bottom is like a, you know, a complete section to speak. That way we can keep tabs on one document, you know, the progress that the commission is making as we move, move through, there are deliverables. \nSPEAKER_04:  because you are F<|de|> \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm gonna be good. \nSPEAKER_04:  and ambitious as that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Mara. \nSPEAKER_01:  following a vicious compass. \nSPEAKER_04:  Anyone have any comments on this? \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Wise? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just have \nSPEAKER_03:  one concern. I'm a little concerned with the \nSPEAKER_03:  the pace at which the supplier code is moving along. I noticed it getting extended. So when is I was trying to find it here. So that now is not coming back to us until I'm going to \nSPEAKER_03:  the second quarter. \nSPEAKER_03:  of this fiscal year, is that correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so that will come to you guys in next month in December. \nSPEAKER_03:  Pardon? \nSPEAKER_01:  that will come to you next month in December for December meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, just that December 22 falls in that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  in that quarter. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good. \nSPEAKER_01:  earlier. Oh sorry, no, just not. \nSPEAKER_01:  But we'll come back in December. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll come back in December. \nSPEAKER_04:  is it December or January? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  It'll be in this number meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, well, my second thing then was I would appreciate it based on this revised schedule if you would provide one of those summary calendars that you do for the next six months or something like that. So you can kind of foresee what's coming each month if we stick to the schedule that we have. Do you know what I'm talking about? The one that's like blue and what that has. Yes, exactly. The one with the blue. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  The one that's like blue and what that has \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I like that. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  y memorable. \nSPEAKER_00:  No, sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  comment was that I think staff is one accommodating one of my requests or do it this way. Commissioner Weiss is requested to do another way. Maybe we should have it done seven different ways for all of us. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Maybe we should. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, any other comments on the action plan? Do we have a motion to approve the updates? \nSPEAKER_04:  and have a motion to approve the updates. \nSPEAKER_04:  In the second. \nSPEAKER_04:  moved by Commissioner Schottwell, seconded by Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_04:  JT I'm gonna... \nSPEAKER_04:  Presumably there's no comments, so let's call the roll then. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner Nordic. \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner David and Dick is. Hi. Commissioner V. Look. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right.

Yes, very quickly. We went over, I could have contact education program. I were doing well just getting the outline scripts built, putting together a smaller internal working group as we get closer to the launch of the training program, just a small group of thought partners to look at that script and that training as January approaches. Our promo materials came in. You guys each have one of our blue totes very excited. \nSPEAKER_02:  to have those. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have several boxes on a pallet somewhere in the basement. \nSPEAKER_02:  Julian and I have to go find before they disappear. \nSPEAKER_02:  But yeah, so lots of bags. I'm very excited about that. We got 4,100 of those bags. So we do have a little bit of money this fiscal year to get some more in that. \nSPEAKER_02:  That will join us in the launch. When the Code of Conduct, the second reading, we'll take that to the City Council with us and just start distributing those. \nSPEAKER_02:  We've started our different partnership meetings, our different internal meetings. I met with the port this week with their executive directors. It was just a great meeting I presented, just an update on the ethics program and the code of conduct that's coming and just was \nSPEAKER_02:  just a warm response from everybody. I think we're going to have a good partner with Director Mario Cudero at the home. So that was nice. And then April and I will be joining a management meeting with the Water Department in January. So \nSPEAKER_02:  All of those connections are starting to happen. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then Julian and I attended the SEC conference in mid-October. We both thought it was a very well organized and thought out conference. Lots of valuable applicable takeaways. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a lot around communications and motivations looking at what motivates the workforce. Branding and storytelling was one that I got a lot out of looking at different engagement strategies. \nSPEAKER_02:  just \nSPEAKER_02:  trying really supporting \nSPEAKER_02:  The compliance and legal requirements that we have, but also really lifting up just the culture of ethics in general and the big takeaway I got from one of the sessions was to. \nSPEAKER_02:  I \nSPEAKER_02:  Kiss. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  Look at everyone as if they were a 10-year-old teacher, you know, the trainings like that don't make them too compliant or legal jargon, just keep it simple. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we just both really, really enjoyed the conference and are looking forward to more professional development in the coming year. And then our reminder, December 14th, is our holiday gathering that the chair has invited us to. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll be at the Eldorado Senior Center for our December meeting so we'll be going to the Eldo after our meeting. So as we get closer to that date, I'll take a poll on who's able to join and who's not. A chair there is an assumption that it's just this group and not necessarily wives or husbands or partners that just wanted to confirm that it's just. \nSPEAKER_02:  Just because. Bring Wives or Husbands if they would like. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, yeah, one of the commissioners and I were chatting via email. We just wanted to confirm that spouses can come to. Okay, sounds good. \nSPEAKER_01:  you want to bring your spouse then. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Feel free to bring your spouse. Just a reminder we're meeting next month at Al Dorado Park. \nSPEAKER_02:  And if you think it will be helpful, I can send out an invitation from my calendar. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  just letting us know. \nSPEAKER_02:  that we're meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  on Studebaker instead of Chestnut. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh next month \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's my report. Thank you. Any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  And it have one I very much appreciate the lessons from the SCCE conference in terms of keeping it less more kind of doing the right thing, entertaining really speaking to the individuals opposed to the Drowning on about compliance and legal requirements and all that just turns people off and they just don't it doesn't resonate with them. But my question is did you get an opportunity to network with any other cities? There there's a lot of people attending those conferences. I don't know what it's like post-pandemic but I didn't know how many other cities were there. \nSPEAKER_02:  We actually did network happenstance with the city of San Diego. So that was helpful. It was it's a very corporate, very private driven group of folks. So but was happy to have that connection with San Diego. \nSPEAKER_02:  and then we're able to network with some of the vendors, NavX in particular, who we're doing a lot of work with right now. So that was really cool. \nSPEAKER_01:  Anyone else? \nSPEAKER_01:  Do I have to make a motion to receive a file? \nSPEAKER_01:  Have a motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Second. \nSPEAKER_01:  moved by Commissioner Fibonidictus, seconded by Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_01:  any public comment? \nSPEAKER_01:  No, pull the gun. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to call the vote please. \nSPEAKER_01:  Congressman, Mr. Leonard. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  The chain is getting again. if it's why I set it, I get up at 7.

We had a number of questions and we could keep her very busy and it seems like every question and answer then raises more questions.
