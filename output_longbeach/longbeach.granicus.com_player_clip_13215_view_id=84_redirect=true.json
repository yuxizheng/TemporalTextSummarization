For more\u8d99 \uad34\ufffd competitions, here are a number of 33-\u54ceoperation \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  item. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Item 4. \nSPEAKER_03:  is a recommendation to conduct, receive, and file a study session regarding the Worker Protection Ordinance approved by Council on February 15th, 2022. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have \nSPEAKER_04:  staff report. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I apologize. Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sure if we could have the clerk please bring up the item. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So we have this the clerk's office only received a presentation for item five. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, there were links on the agenda for the other item now. \nSPEAKER_03:  There were links on the agenda correct. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, they didn't make it into a side. \nSPEAKER_01:  My apologies. So what we're looking at in this item is the worker retention ordinance that was the package for COVID relief. The item was asked to be brought forward to evaluate the continuation of the ordinance as other ordinances in the package with this at that point in time have since sunset. So what we're looking at in this item is the worker retention ordinance that was asked to be brought forward to evaluate the ordinance. \nSPEAKER_01:  economic development has handled the questions related to the ordinance as they've come in from the business community who would deem themselves impacted at this point in time. We have a section on the economic development website that clearly details the steps and the qualifications for organizations or excuse me for businesses who who fit the criteria to comply we facilitate any \nSPEAKER_01:  questions about liability or impacts of not complying with the ordinance with city attorney. And to this point, the staff report to the council should focus on the fact that \nSPEAKER_01:  There are, there are few. \nSPEAKER_01:  protracted inquiries past the direction. \nSPEAKER_01:  to consult the website and confirm the instructions on the website with the council. In the instance that we've had to involve city attorney, the report's back to economic development staff are that most inquiries are handled within a phone call and we have never received to date any instance where we needed to follow up or push anybody towards enforcement mechanisms other than educating the business owner about the responsibility related to the ordinance in terms of staff time and effort to ensure compliance related to business requests. Minimal at best at this time so it would appear that the ordinance remaining in effect the ability to access information related to ordinance immediately on economic development's website and our ability to coordinate answer and response with attorney appears to be effective for the business community and potentially impacted workers at this point in time. So stop there and take any questions from any of the \nSPEAKER_01:  committee members at this point in time. \nSPEAKER_04:  Excellent. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate the report. \nSPEAKER_04:  any comments from \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  The committee? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_04:  faculty councilmember Richardson. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_00:  Just \nSPEAKER_00:  would say thanks for the presentation and continue to \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, monitor, I mean, many of the policies that we instituted. \nSPEAKER_00:  over the course of the pandemic were really because we needed local protections to protect our local \nSPEAKER_00:  workers and people who live here in the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  And some of the things we've never done before. And so there are a lot of things to learn. \nSPEAKER_00:  about \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  you know what this new economy looks like. \nSPEAKER_00:  what the recovery looks like and so we're going to need you next to continue to \nSPEAKER_00:  The monetary. \nSPEAKER_00:  Pay attention to \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, \nSPEAKER_00:  you know. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  our recovery. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, tell us where we see. \nSPEAKER_00:  where we're making progress, where policies are making progress, and if there are things up. \nSPEAKER_00:  We need to improve. We need to know that as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  So thanks for the presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing no other comment, do we have public comment from? \nSPEAKER_04:  the audience and others online. \nSPEAKER_02:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number four, in person, please line up at the podium. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing none, if there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 4 in Zoom, please use the raise hand feature or dial star 9 now. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  Wonderful. \nSPEAKER_04:  My last question would be to Nick. \nSPEAKER_04:  Are there any areas that you see we could make immediate improvements? \nSPEAKER_04:  to support \nSPEAKER_04:  disordinates and the businesses. \nSPEAKER_04:  and their workers. \nSPEAKER_01:  Again, we're not hearing a demand for \nSPEAKER_01:  additional ordinance or city policy at this point in time. I think most folks are \nSPEAKER_01:  aware of what exists at this point in time and just want to be able to make sure they have access to \nSPEAKER_01:  continued information on safe opening, operation, health and safety protocols. If there are any updates \nSPEAKER_01:  in the virus with the virus. Folks want to know that and want to hear a little bit about that data and how it might impact them and the continued operation of their business. But I think most folks are well aware of what they need to do, have to do, and what they've been able to do successfully to operate at this point in time. \nSPEAKER_04:  And would you say that your division has the resources necessary to continue to be a resource? \nSPEAKER_01:  I would say as conditions exist right now, yes. If it came to another severe spike and we were talking about access to PPE or to ensure that the most up-to-date health orders were out there and folks were aware of those types of things. We've transitioned to supporting folks' operation and moved away from that information conduit related to the health measures and those types of things at some point. So there would be some type of subit pivot that would require us to reposition resources. And if we needed to support folks again with access to PPE and other types of safety measures for their business, I don't know the adequate resources are budgeted or there to take that on it to any degree of scale that we had to do previously. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, especially related to where we are with staffing issues citywide. So just wanted to check in and make sure that that's. \nSPEAKER_04:  at least. \nSPEAKER_04:  considered. \nSPEAKER_04:  No other comments? I will ask for a roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  Armago. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye, bye, Sherry Tritton. \nSPEAKER_04:  I see his lips moving but he was muted. \nSPEAKER_01:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_04:  receive \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilwoman Allen. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm..."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Ocean Care. \nSPEAKER_05:  I- \nSPEAKER_05:  item five. \nSPEAKER_02:  Item five. \nSPEAKER_02:  is a recommendation to receive in follow-up report on recent economic indicators. \nSPEAKER_05:  One of my favorite presenters. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know if you're referring to me, Madam Chair. Dr. Steinman isn't going to join us today. So I'm going to run. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to run you through this. \nSPEAKER_05:  I love the information that comes from Long Beach State and the collaboration between all of you to get us this information. It's so helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we love you, Dune. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what I want to do is is and it was a preface to some of the other information that we were supposed to receive today would have all looked really nice and unison. But this is good given the current economic conditions and some of the climate we're experiencing at this point in time. I just wanted the committee to be aware of some of the questions we're getting and what we see is the answers that the public and our stakeholders are entitled to and where things may be going in the short term. So next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the subject areas for today's frequently asked questions are about employment, inflation and financial markets, our GDP and economic growth and then home prices. Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So let's start with employment. And one of the biggest questions we get all the time is how is the leisure and hospitality sector still struggling when job growth is surging? So let's take a look at that if we can. Next slide. So here you see the California employment recovery from one year into the pandemic to March of 2022. And you'll see accommodation in food service, arts and entertainment and recreation actually have the most jobs recovered compared to other sectors and some of the highest percentages of job growth. So again, why are they struggling to find workers in those key areas? Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  You'll see our California recovery both in terms of total non-farm employment, which is the top line, and then leisure and hospitality, which is the darker brown or lower line. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I would point you to the gap between the two, the one per 0.5% of total jobs were still looking to recover versus the 9.7% of jobs in leisure and hospitality. So the. \nSPEAKER_01:  job crunch or tightness in the economy related to this sector is the gap or the whole we have to fill of the 10% that is still below pre-pandemic levels. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  And this shows you a little bit more about where people have gone back, how certain sectors have grown. And what sectors are still lagging in terms of making it back to their their pre pandemic employment levels. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  So why is it so hard again for the service industry to find workers and don't these workers want to go back to work? \nSPEAKER_01:  And the hard answer to that question is yes, they want to go back to work. They just don't want to go back to work of where they worked before. You saw the surge in transportation and warehouse working up 14% in Long Beach. That's a key industry related to our work in the good movement sectors. And when folks couldn't go out, seek leisure and hospitality activities, they used the money for the income they had and substituted hard goods for in-person services. And a lot of folks were able to find jobs in logistics and warehousing related to that. Those jobs pay somewhat more on average even at the entry level than hospitality and leisure. Some of the hours related to service are more predictable. And many of those jobs allowed folks to work from home during the pandemic. That's not to say there aren't important gains in the leisure and hospitality industry. You'll see that leisure and hospitality earning \nSPEAKER_01:  are up 29% since before the pandemic. So people have talked about a great resignation or \nSPEAKER_01:  ghosting quitting the workforce, those types of things. What you're seeing is that people who had experienced skills or transferable skills are using that to renegotiate either into a higher paying industry or better pay at the jobs that they're returning to. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks, slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the next question is, why is California's unemployment rate still so high and so high relative to national employment? And what I would tell you is if you take a look at California unemployment, we've always lag behind the national average. That's nothing new at this point in time. We can go to the next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that'll add Long Beach as the blue line to your chart historically with California's flag versus the US. Bomb Beach has also lagged California in terms of unemployment. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  And here you can see that unemployment highlighted during periods of downturn. So over the last couple of recessions. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Again, California has traditionally lag. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  and long beaches. \nSPEAKER_01:  lag, even though this time around, we're coming closer to being even with the state rather than lagging it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we've heard some talk over time. Do uninsurance, do unemployment benefits or generous unemployment benefits, extensions, some of the other programs that California have offered have any impact on a higher unemployment rate than other areas. And you'll see now, our unemployment benefits don't explain our elevated unemployment rates when we look at California versus the rest of the US. Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. So, so what does explain it? I'm going to suggest it's it's our racial and ethnic diversity mix in the state of California and that's amplified by our racial and and ethnic diversity here in the city of Long Beach. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  You can see and it's probably well known to all of you that typically black and Hispanic workers have lacked labor market gains from their white and Asian counterparts. We have higher concentrations of those workers in the state of California, be in the city of Long Beach and many of the jobs associated with those demographics are again in the industry. We have a leisure and hospitality food service that we showed you who still haven't fully recovered from the pandemic. So our legs are most likely explained by those that combination of racial and ethnic diversity and job mix, job mix across sectors here in Long Beach. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so just again, traditional answer is more that we're concentrated in leisure hospitality tourism. But if you look at California and the R percentage of jobs there as compared to the US. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's not that big of a difference to explain those things away. It goes back to the opportunity gaps in large shares of our workforce. And also the fact that our labor market in California is so tight that workers may be taking more time looking for jobs. If you look at again, our civilian labor force numbers, they're down even though our population here grew in Long Beach during the pandemic. Folks have some savings. \nSPEAKER_01:  do you to increase unemployment benefits, some stimulus programs and other things that they were able to take advantage of and they have some time to do some training, some some upskilling or to be more patient about the job that they're willing to take at this point in time. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what's going on with inflation and the financial markets? And we hear a lot about this. Why is everything so expensive? How long is it going to last? Let's take a look at that. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we've seen that retail spending is up 27% before the pandemic and online retail is up 41% since before the pandemic. And this increase in demand for goods has put some strength on supply chains. And you know, we've seen shutdowns in China, Singapore only recently reopened after a couple months layoff and that's that's having some effect on inflation and prices next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  You can see across categories where inflation has been driven up gasoline, shelter, food, and all other items are there for your comparison. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, we had a heavy consumer demand that was driven by 4.2 trillion in relief spending and caused unfettered economic expansion. And again, we've seen supply chains struggle to keep up from intermittent coven lockdowns to warehouse space and trucker shortages. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  the invasion of the Ukraine in February 2022 and \nSPEAKER_01:  And of course, we talked a little bit about the expansion, narrow monetary policy of the Fed to help us find our way out of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So here talks a little bit about interest rates and monetary policy, as you know, for two years, we had money was basically free, zero interest rate. The Fed did that. \nSPEAKER_01:  to add to the U.S. is balance sheet during the pandemic. And there was about $5 trillion in spending issued. So we could launch the federal programs to help boost the U.S. out of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  Go back one, please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So again, it goes back to supply and demand. Influencynce caused by stimulating demand while supply is struggling to keep up for the reasons we just mentioned. Supply chains, troubles in Europe. The feds now responding. Dr. Steinman and I put this together before last week when you saw another 0.7, five point increase in the target interest rate in the hopes that the fed would begin to be able to reduce their balance sheets and interest rates have been rising slightly and in anticipation, in anticipation of that move. So you can see that \nSPEAKER_01:  the gap between the 10 year bond rate and the 30 year mortgage rate and peg those increases and rate hikes directly to the rate you can expect now to see on a 30 year mortgage. So with a .75 point increase last week, you've seen 30 year mortgage rates jump over 6% in the last week or so. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what's going on with the stock market? Is it up or is it down? \nSPEAKER_01:  Since January, we've seen the market decline, and it's all about uncertainty. Future inflationary concerns and the facts that the initial two interest rates by the feds haven't stabilized things, is causing investors some concerns. The supply chain interruptions we talked about continues to be a concern for investors. And when you talk about the uncertainty regarding the war in Ukraine and what's that doing to energy in fuel prices and again those those energy supplies and those fuels help to keep producers cranking all those things that are in demand out. There's some concern about costs or to me prices remaining unchecked there. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  But when you keep everything in mind, the market is still up 16%. \nSPEAKER_01:  free pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Go ahead, next time. \nSPEAKER_01:  So GDP and economic growth. \nSPEAKER_01:  Quickly. \nSPEAKER_01:  Why did our GDP \nSPEAKER_01:  Fall last quarter and is increasing demand for imports hurting our GDP. Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  We saw during the pandemic that low interest rates or no interest rates consumers having increased dollars to spend drove us toward a strong GTP. GDP excuse me and that's been curtailed lately by the rising interest rates who seen the feds take on over the last three quarters. The the expiration of some of the stimulus programs were folks have had some additional or discretionary money to spend. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  again, I continue to talk about the limits on our supply chains and those capacities. It's caused at least in terms of the US some reductions in exports. And folks aren't investing in inventories when you remember back to October last year and the issues at the port. A lot of that was caused by the fact that folks were overordering for 2021 because they were concerned about supply chain and not being able to be fully stocked for the holiday or high demand season. Some of those inventories have remained in place and folks aren't looking to restock at the same level that they were before. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  imports and GDP. So again, consumption plus investment plus governments that spending plus exports minus imports or net exports is what drives GDP. That's your definition of GDP right there. And so how do we account for three trillion in imports of consumer goods, subtract it from net exports added to consumption that the net effect is zero impact on GDP. Large trade deficits only reduce GDP when exports are lowered. And we've only experienced marginal loss of exports over the last quarter of set. Of course so. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  home prizes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Why are they so expensive and will they keep rise? \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here you can look at the. \nSPEAKER_01:  the median average on a 30 year mortgage for some of the \nSPEAKER_01:  largest MSAs in the state and also look at the increase in the two and a quarter years since the onset of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  So now thinking about that and we talked about the \nSPEAKER_01:  increase to the rate on a 30 year mortgage based on the fed's last reactions. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  A couple months ago at a 3% in interest rate if you want to pay 3000 a month for 30 years for a home. You could buy 712 thousand dollars worth of house. Today with the rate rising to just over 6% That same 30 year loan at $3,000 a month. You can afford half a million dollars worth of house. At this point in time. So what what what's the rise in and housing price due to low interest rates. Which would go which are going away and limited supply during the pandemic. Now we should start to see prices slow eventually fall. But the fact that it hasn't happened as dramatically as we would like to see just speaks to the persistent lack of supply. \nSPEAKER_01:  here in California. \nSPEAKER_01:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a question for you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  So specifically like in a long beach \nSPEAKER_03:  I imagine that the market's going to slow down. How does that affect our general fund? \nSPEAKER_03:  with as far as tax. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sorry, I got to plug it for you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that was a lot. \nSPEAKER_01:  So yeah, so it will obviously have some effect on that. Again, you know, the state has a progressive tax structure. So high earners pay more. Again, when you have those folks buying into your housing market, contributing to your to your tax base, it's going to drive revenues up. If folks aren't able to buy as many or as much at those certain prices, we're going to experience the negative impact of that. \nSPEAKER_05:  They appreciate your input. \nSPEAKER_05:  Nick. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  that I might offer a counterpoint to Councilman Allen's question. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  based on the presentation we received from an initial management. \nSPEAKER_05:  We were projecting. \nSPEAKER_05:  revenue from \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  property taxes to be at a certain level. We are far exceeding that. \nSPEAKER_05:  because the number of homes that turned over during the last three years has significantly increased. And so the number of homes that are being reassessed because they weren't \nSPEAKER_05:  transferred under a prompt. \nSPEAKER_05:  19 \nSPEAKER_05:  parent child, parent to grandchild transfer. \nSPEAKER_05:  I've hit the market. \nSPEAKER_05:  Therefore, \nSPEAKER_05:  If \nSPEAKER_05:  There is a significant amount of decline in value. \nSPEAKER_05:  The decline in value would really only be in the revenue received. \nSPEAKER_05:  over the prior two year increase. It could only hit that increase because a majority of the properties in the city of Long Beach \nSPEAKER_05:  are still at their \nSPEAKER_05:  purchase price value, which is significantly less than. \nSPEAKER_05:  the total value and \nSPEAKER_05:  considerably less than what their value was pre-pandemic if the price is restored to that level. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  while there could be a decline in \nSPEAKER_05:  property taxes. \nSPEAKER_05:  from today's. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Fire Quarter. \nSPEAKER_05:  it would still be less than what the financial management division had projected. \nSPEAKER_05:  which would still mean additional revenue over what was originally projected. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know that's confusing and I know that's based on a presentation that happened two weeks ago. \nSPEAKER_05:  but I \nSPEAKER_05:  from my understanding of discussions with financial planning. \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  We are not as a city projecting. \nSPEAKER_05:  continued increases in property tax. \nSPEAKER_05:  and with Prop 19. \nSPEAKER_05:  We have different groups across the country. Labour weak water. It is in South Africa. It is a pop 19 and it is existing. With \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it was part 19 that just passed. \nSPEAKER_05:  the parent child transfer options have declined. So the number of properties that aren't subjected to a reassessment has also declined, which then reduces the city's risk. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know that was a really... \nSPEAKER_05:  You really have to know what I was saying to know what I said. \nSPEAKER_05:  That makes sense. \nSPEAKER_01:  We\u61c9\u8a72 we're \nSPEAKER_05:  It's been a while, isn't it? \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we're landing in the same spot that we're not anticipate to see an increase in revenue. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  related to. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think we are. We are. I think financial management stated. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  We received an increase and we will continue to receive increases at levels greater than what we were expecting. \nSPEAKER_05:  until which the point where \nSPEAKER_05:  those that are. \nSPEAKER_05:  going to potentially be sold off, if any are sold off, or people file the client and values, which have a delay. If you file a client and value, you don't get that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  reprise immediately. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  that takes the assessor's office a considerable amount of time. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think that maybe it would be a good idea to have. \nSPEAKER_05:  financial management bring in what their projections are for that category specifically. And then I know you talked about our aggressive tax and I know you were talking about property tax, but \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  when I saw the numbers on \nSPEAKER_05:  the percentage of transition to online sales. I know we've talked about it anecdotal. \nSPEAKER_05:  but I have a concern about how that hit sales tax because our sales tax. \nSPEAKER_05:  Formula for online sales is different than the direct sales tax revenue we receive. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I know Eric Romero wasn't here for that presentation today. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and I haven't I haven't seen the last quarter of data. \nSPEAKER_05:  Woof! \nSPEAKER_05:  The storm ahead. \nSPEAKER_05:  Good question, Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_05:  It could get crazy in 24 months. \nSPEAKER_05:  The revenue we receive in 24 months, which is projected. \nSPEAKER_05:  in the next budget cycle in October. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? I see. I'll next. He'll tell me if I'm wrong. I see you thinking too. \nSPEAKER_01:  I see. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  23. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  So sorry about that. Any additional questions? Good question, by the way. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  There's just a few things. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks for the presentation. \nSPEAKER_00:  are lots of people on there. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think what, you know, some of this is interesting. In fact, that. \nSPEAKER_00:  We saw the good movements. \nSPEAKER_00:  increase since, you know, we saw direct impact on the \nSPEAKER_00:  the fact that people \nSPEAKER_00:  We're buying things from home. \nSPEAKER_00:  41% increase in demand. I think is what the chart said. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  And I can tell you we saw an impact. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, I am. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have Matheson Flight Extenders just open a facility. \nSPEAKER_00:  to New Warehouse. \nSPEAKER_00:  300 jobs. \nSPEAKER_00:  They're minimum starting point. \nSPEAKER_00:  was like 20, 25 bucks an hour. \nSPEAKER_00:  They hired managers all of that 300 new jobs in the past like six months. \nSPEAKER_00:  and there's significantly more demand as well for some of those jobs and they were good. They hired a lot of people from Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  in those positions of the brand new \nSPEAKER_00:  positions. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so \nSPEAKER_00:  I think the more that we can \nSPEAKER_00:  um, ensure that we benefit from this global \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, e-commerce, boom. \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, we should be as selfish as we can in Long Beach to capture as much of that economic. \nSPEAKER_00:  growth and activities we can. \nSPEAKER_00:  and sure that you know they're \nSPEAKER_00:  your maintaining. \nSPEAKER_00:  quality jobs. So that's I think that's good. \nSPEAKER_00:  And he was also interesting to know that people went... \nSPEAKER_00:  skills fair better than the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_00:  with transferable skills. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think that \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, that was something we... \nSPEAKER_00:  We uh \nSPEAKER_00:  We expected. \nSPEAKER_00:  And as we talked about sort of recovery, we talked about the rules, you know, skill trades and community colleges. \nSPEAKER_00:  but I think it just... \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, \nSPEAKER_00:  time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Reminds us that we need to continue to boost and invest in Community College and Training programs. Make sure that our workforce has those skills because it makes us. \nSPEAKER_00:  a more resilient city economically. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we have a workforce that's trained. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I think that's really good. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know, still troubling to see that hospitality. \nSPEAKER_00:  service and tourism still impacted. \nSPEAKER_00:  lagging. \nSPEAKER_00:  It also justifies some of the things we took to protect some of their jobs and offer their jobs back. \nSPEAKER_00:  because they need everything that they can get. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  particularly this sector for workers. \nSPEAKER_00:  And if they don't end up going back to food service or hospitality. \nSPEAKER_00:  We should make it easy for them to build up those skills, to transition to something that \nSPEAKER_00:  maybe more attainable. \nSPEAKER_00:  for them. \nSPEAKER_00:  more interesting. \nSPEAKER_00:  or pays better wages. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I think that's it. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's good. \nSPEAKER_00:  Last thing I'll say is, I'm glad that you... \nSPEAKER_00:  pointed out where we still have work to do on unemployment. It's great that we're \nSPEAKER_00:  at pre-candemic levels unemployment, but we had some problems prior to it. \nSPEAKER_00:  part of the pandemic in terms of \nSPEAKER_00:  unemployment rates being higher and Latino of black communities. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that was an issue before. \nSPEAKER_00:  and I'm not surprised this is an issue today. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that just means that we have to continue. \nSPEAKER_00:  to target employment as best as we can. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, as \nSPEAKER_00:  strategies, local strategies to overcome those barriers and get people into pipelines for good jobs and \nSPEAKER_00:  keep focusing on opportunity gaps and \nSPEAKER_00:  Strategies and address opportunity to have seen. \nSPEAKER_00:  for a flood, opportunities in our community. So, \nSPEAKER_00:  the fact that that's \nSPEAKER_00:  in your report, I think that reaffirms. \nSPEAKER_00:  that one, we're heading the right direction in terms of \nSPEAKER_00:  on the way we're thinking about it. \nSPEAKER_00:  and we can't let our foot off the pedal. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have, there's a lot we need to do to make sure that. \nSPEAKER_00:  You know. \nSPEAKER_00:  as we recover. \nSPEAKER_00:  whole communities are lagging, left on. \nSPEAKER_00:  So those are my thoughts, my comments. Thanks so much for your presentation. \nSPEAKER_00:  I thought it was great. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. I'll answer my comments here. Great presentation. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would just really love to see us. \nSPEAKER_05:  really concentrate on. \nSPEAKER_05:  employing those that have traditionally been. \nSPEAKER_05:  harder to reach and more unemployed. And there are a lot of programs that are being crafted at \nSPEAKER_05:  the county level or the regional level within certain cities that are models that we could work through. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I would also be interested in knowing if those same gaps existed when Long Beach was really at the forefront of radiation. \nSPEAKER_05:  because when a big industry, a really cutting edge industry, takes over a city in the way that Donald Douglas eventually bowing, did, I think that there was lower overall unemployment. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I'd be interested to know how that impacted across the city and where those jobs landed and came from. And if that was as strong, I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  We use the word historical when back to 2005. \nSPEAKER_05:  I mean. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's not. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's calling me pretty old because I was at a grad school by then. \nSPEAKER_05:  I mean, historical. I would love to look back to the \nSPEAKER_05:  the real job boom of Long Beach and see what we did right then and how it could be mirrored. There's a lot of opportunity. And then I'd really love us to concentrate within our own city. \nSPEAKER_05:  on particular programs. I was. \nSPEAKER_05:  talking with Glendale today about a program that they're doing. \nSPEAKER_05:  to really harvest new. \nSPEAKER_05:  firefighters out of EMT programs and how LA County is targeting \nSPEAKER_05:  disadvantaged communities to go through an intensive program to become EMTs. \nSPEAKER_05:  So you're taking \nSPEAKER_05:  people out of disadvantaged communities that are typically \nSPEAKER_05:  unemployed. \nSPEAKER_05:  You're giving them that leg up. \nSPEAKER_05:  to get into a career path that then gets them to be. \nSPEAKER_05:  firefighters and 15 of their firefighters are coming straight out of that program. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's amazing. \nSPEAKER_05:  that's almost half their class to really. \nSPEAKER_05:  focus on. \nSPEAKER_05:  supporting that in the industry that is very secure and \nSPEAKER_05:  And um \nSPEAKER_05:  has a lot of upward mobility so. \nSPEAKER_05:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_05:  A lot of work to do like Council members, Richard, as I said, we're moving in the right direction. \nSPEAKER_05:  data really needs to define our steps forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  and um \nSPEAKER_05:  I've also read a lot about some of the career path that are high schools and colleges and I'd love to see. \nSPEAKER_05:  more focus on \nSPEAKER_05:  initial jobs that young people can get. \nSPEAKER_05:  Are young people talk a lot about how difficult it is to get a job and yet? \nSPEAKER_05:  Here's an industry. \nSPEAKER_05:  that. \nSPEAKER_05:  service and customer service really translates to anything you want to do in the future. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that could be a great opportunity. So \nSPEAKER_05:  I look forward to hearing. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd love to hear from my colleagues if there's another step that we want to take from this report. \nSPEAKER_05:  is really valuable information and what we could \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm do with it next, I think is also important. Before I get to that, \nSPEAKER_05:  Nick. \nSPEAKER_05:  was this presented to the Economic Development Commission as well? \nSPEAKER_01:  Given given the timing of presentations, the committee has seen this level of detail in the report before the commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd love to send all the commissioners a link to today's meeting so that they could see what we saw. \nSPEAKER_05:  without the formalities of waiting for a meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think this is really, really useful. Great presentation, Nick. \nSPEAKER_05:  I mean, excellent. Excellent. Councilman Allen, did you have any other questions? I'm sorry I jumped in there earlier. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, no worries. No, you had great comments and I just I agree with you Madam Chairman, I just think that we have to. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, things are changing so rapidly. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I think just keeping us up to date on this information. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the bigger picture is going to be really important. So thank you so much Nick for this. I really appreciate the presentation as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Madam Clerk, let's go to public comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number five in person, please line up at the podium. \nSPEAKER_04:  See you then. \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item number five, in Zoom please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment for this item. \nSPEAKER_05:  Reverend Bowbeels. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you to motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  Some move. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair Mungo. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Vice Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilwoman Allen. \nSPEAKER_02:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that concludes our meeting. Can we have general public comment? \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on general public comment in person, please line up at the podium. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you."
