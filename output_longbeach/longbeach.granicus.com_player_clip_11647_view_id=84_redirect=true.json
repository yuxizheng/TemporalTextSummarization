Let's move the second in. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd like to go to any public comment. This is an opportunity to talk about the ELB. \nSPEAKER_03:  the items that have already been discussed before the budget oversight committee. \nSPEAKER_02:  There are no public comments for this item. \nSPEAKER_03:  or the Democratic comment, that's great. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll take it to the council members by chair price. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have no questions at this time. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Council member Yoraga. \nSPEAKER_04:  God. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is this apparent that Burak can ask about the overages? \nSPEAKER_04:  or do a general layer discussion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ask your sister. \nSPEAKER_03:  \uc544 Hari? [( \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can you say, overages? Well. \nSPEAKER_03:  Please elaborate. Just go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  I was just regarding the budgets for the various city council offices. I know some. \nSPEAKER_04:  Council offices have overages that can be \nSPEAKER_04:  transferred over into a 2021 budget or at least portions of it and others go to the divide by nine. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I know we've had some discussion about what we want to do with that. \nSPEAKER_04:  This would be the appropriate time to bring that up. \nSPEAKER_04:  or we can add. \nSPEAKER_04:  discuss it at another time when we adopt the full burden. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So I understand that the question to be related to elected official budgets. \nSPEAKER_03:  or legislative offices. \nSPEAKER_03:  And there's been some discussion of \nSPEAKER_03:  Obviously. \nSPEAKER_03:  the council taking. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  And all elected offices, anticipated and \nSPEAKER_03:  and the shared sacrifice that we're asking our employees. \nSPEAKER_03:  in departments to encourage. \nSPEAKER_03:  to meet our budget needs. \nSPEAKER_03:  or staff, do you have any comments on how that can be accomplished? \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_03:  Tiele Brook punt, that we will put to Theta toughest part of our \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So if I understand committee member Uranca's statement is that every year at year end when there is, if there is an E, any surplus funds in the legislative department by practice and policy adopted by the city council, those funds are rolled over to the council district specific divide by nine accounts. \nSPEAKER_01:  If there is a desire to roll those any surplus funds over, if there are any at the end of the year, to some other purpose or for operating, that would be something that this committee or the council could discuss. They would have to be approved. And some of the considerations would be, what are the purposes of rolling that over as a general practice? If there are surplus funds at the end of the year, in the general fund, that usually falls to the bottom line. And \nSPEAKER_01:  is something that the full council can look at. \nSPEAKER_01:  what the situation is at year end and then determine the highest priority of where those funding can go. And so those are just some things to consider when looking at any kind of carryover of general funds or plus funds at the end of the year. \nSPEAKER_00:  And maybe another comment and grace can correct me if I'm incorrect on this. I believe that we roll, we don't roll over, but any council district surplus is by procedure and basically a policy rolled over into divide by nine without discussion. There's a semi-automatic action that the administration brings it forward to council in an annual appropriation. I believe those are the only elected officials where there is an automatic roll over, so to speak, into divide by nine. There are other electeds who make a request to carry over, but the only bi-policy automatic carryover is for the legislative department. \nSPEAKER_00:  Actually only divide by only council districts. \nSPEAKER_03:  Actually only the device. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Council member, you're longer than you can follow up to that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, what about those city council officers that have a very little \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_04:  Roll over. \nSPEAKER_04:  that goes into the back by nine and maybe that would be what we wanted to. \nSPEAKER_04:  hold with the cares for \nSPEAKER_04:  general office purposes that's such as \nSPEAKER_04:  lust setting \u3042\u3082\u306e\u840e\u76ca\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059 \nSPEAKER_02:  So again. \nSPEAKER_04:  and careful. \nSPEAKER_04:  I can understand it's from offices that have... \nSPEAKER_04:  substantial amount of a roll over but their offices that do not like marine \nSPEAKER_01:  So committee member, yes, the practice and the policy to, for the council districts to roll over any surplus funds at the end of the year into divide by nine is separate from what the amount is if a council district does not have any savings, then you are correct. No funding rolls over to divide by nine. \nSPEAKER_01:  and if it's a larger amount than that amount rolls over as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So all of the funding once it rolls over to divide by nine the use of it and the appropriation of it does usually and Have to come back to city council so that it is disclosed What those funds are used for and the purposes of those funds at the moment it It has not rolled over to operating funds in terms of just running a council district's general operating budget \nSPEAKER_05:  Remember, if you'd like to discuss this further, I would recommend that we agenda this separately, as this item does not seem to be on the list of questions that were up for discussion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Why? I did bring that up at the beginning of the week. \nSPEAKER_05:  No, I know, and I apologize, my computer froze when I was trying to pull up the agenda. So, just if we could agenda is it separately in in discuss it, maybe it next week's meeting that would be better. \nSPEAKER_05:  from a brand-new standpoint. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Paul, for this. That be fine with me. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And if I could just add, I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, what was discussed was \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, the legislative department. \nSPEAKER_03:  actually \nSPEAKER_03:  participating in \nSPEAKER_03:  budget reductions. \nSPEAKER_03:  to help meet the needs and I think that number was somewhere around four or five percent. \nSPEAKER_03:  if I understand what we will be discussing at a later date. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  from council member Yoraga. \nSPEAKER_03:  It was to have the option to help make up that difference. \nSPEAKER_03:  by using their, their own. \nSPEAKER_03:  Rollover. \nSPEAKER_03:  unused. \nSPEAKER_03:  resources from our previous year. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is that correct if I understand that correctly just so the staff is clear? \nSPEAKER_03:  Ange Scherze and \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  up. \nSPEAKER_04:  But at the same time, we want to have it so that \nSPEAKER_04:  There are no real \nSPEAKER_04:  big major impact on how we \nSPEAKER_04:  on how we have our offices. I mean, there's... \nSPEAKER_04:  There's that willingness to participate. \nSPEAKER_04:  but not at the expense of affecting how we are. \nSPEAKER_04:  how we interact with our constituents. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sure we'll have that discussion next week. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  and of \nSPEAKER_03:  So with this was there any other comments from Council Member Urogo on past follow-up items? \nSPEAKER_03:  No. \nSPEAKER_03:  Here we go. \nSPEAKER_05:  Here we go. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mlehm Paul? \nSPEAKER_05:  My apologies. If you guys would like to discuss this further on, it looks like item number three would be more appropriate. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  If you don't want to want to. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you don't want to win. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you don't want to wait until next week. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, well, I think we should... \nSPEAKER_03:  That opens up an opportunity to do that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  Under item number two is there. \nSPEAKER_03:  any public comment? \nSPEAKER_02:  No public comment here. \nSPEAKER_03:  Not great. And so, \nSPEAKER_03:  Please let's go to a... \nSPEAKER_03:  Good walk! \nSPEAKER_02:  Can't remember you, Ranga. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Ike. \nSPEAKER_02:  Vice chair price. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so the next item, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Item 3 is a recommendation to for the Budget Oversight Committee's fiscal year FY21 budget recommendations for Council consider."

Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_03:  Expriture. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ray Maylor. \nSPEAKER_03:  You have three minutes to speak. Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I've done so thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon. The committee, my name is Ray Meiler. I live in Long Beach, I know two small residential properties. \nSPEAKER_01:  I pose the mayor's line item to create a legal defense fund for the tenant. \nSPEAKER_01:  This will only increase expenses for mom and pop housing providers. \nSPEAKER_01:  We already make much less than all of our tenants after all the risk we have taken. \nSPEAKER_01:  and hard work to provide housing to residents of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're already implying to be very reasonable with our tenants. \nSPEAKER_01:  that is kind of the nature of being a monopop owner. \nSPEAKER_01:  And you not understand why the council continuously throws obstacles in the way of providing housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  long Beach President. \nSPEAKER_01:  Several of the council members simply do not understand the business of providing housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  and really wish it was otherwise. If there's some opportunity, some us. \nSPEAKER_01:  We small property owners could sit down with particular council members and give them an education on the \nSPEAKER_01:  Mechanics are providing housing and we would be very open to doing that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Lydia Ringwald, you have three minutes to speak. Please, I'm your phone. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, we can. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, on the rental contract is a clause saying that the prevailing party in any litigation, the attorney's fees are paid by the prevailing party. \nSPEAKER_06:  So there shouldn't be any need for additional funding. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the $250,000 seems excessive. \nSPEAKER_06:  because how many tenants have actually been illegally or wrongly removed. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think in most cases. \nSPEAKER_06:  of property owners are keeping. \nSPEAKER_06:  that they're abiding by the rules and if the tenant can't pay, they barely stay there. They try to cooperate with the rules. So I would imagine they're very few. \nSPEAKER_06:  that are actually. \nSPEAKER_06:  wrongly removed. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I wondered if you had any statistics, how many people are... \nSPEAKER_06:  would be involved in that. \nSPEAKER_06:  It seemed like it'd be a small number and $250,000 is excessive. \nSPEAKER_06:  especially because \nSPEAKER_06:  the rental contract should... \nSPEAKER_06:  award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. \nSPEAKER_06:  Show it. \nSPEAKER_06:  the landlord has done something wrong and the tenant wins. \nSPEAKER_06:  there. \nSPEAKER_06:  the landlord pays the attorney's fees of the tenant right there. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you hear me okay? \nSPEAKER_05:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  We can hear you. \nSPEAKER_06: oped against being an intermediate school. Today's \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. OK. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, that's the basic point. And of course, another issue. It would be wonderful, too. \nSPEAKER_06:  invest these funds in something that would really benefit all of us. \nSPEAKER_06:  Maybe a beautiful mural for City Hall. \nSPEAKER_06:  something on the history of California, I'm working with the Long Beach Art Museum on that kind of an idea. \nSPEAKER_06:  And for that kind of fun even we would really have something long lasting and beautiful that would be an inspiration for everybody. \nSPEAKER_06:  to something uplifting. \nSPEAKER_06:  something for the human spirit. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would prefer seeing the funds go towards. \nSPEAKER_06:  something that. \nSPEAKER_06:  \u00c9 ta aqui, ser\u00e1? \nSPEAKER_06:  morally ethically and. \nSPEAKER_06:  inspirational. \nSPEAKER_06:  We need that now. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for your comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  to my request. \nSPEAKER_06:  No. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Rex, Pritchard, you have three minutes to speak. \nSPEAKER_03:  Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Rex Pritchard, President of Long Beach Firefighters Association. \nSPEAKER_02:  respectfully requesting the BOC to make a recommendation to full council. \nSPEAKER_02:  to keep the $400,000 in the fire department and keep one heart unit in service. \nSPEAKER_02:  versus creating another program. \nSPEAKER_02:  similar to the fire department's heart unit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the health department. \nSPEAKER_02:  My concern is, heart is a established program. \nSPEAKER_02:  doing good work in and out and for the health department to stand up in a similar program. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's going to take a greater investment than $400,000. So let's keep what's working. \nSPEAKER_02:  and have one heart unit left in the fire department. And then the second request would be instead of spending $200,000. \nSPEAKER_02:  for an outside consultant. \nSPEAKER_02:  use those dollars to help fund. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh, partial service restoration, potentially of the heart unit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  or some other service that the City Council sees fit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that concludes public comment. Yes. I'd like to take it to the committee before I speak. Councilmember Yoronga, do you have any comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, I think that we pretty much discussed the budget pretty uh \nSPEAKER_04:  pretty much in depth and I think I'm ready to go. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, I don't disagree with you, love. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice to your price. \nSPEAKER_08:  I agree with Councilman Ranga and I look forward to hearing your recommendations. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, I will just say that it has been a great experience, humbling experience and honor to serve as chair of the Budget Oversight Committee during this very difficult year, 2020 FY21. And I will just say that facing a $30 million budget shortfall with some serious reductions proposed and sacrifices from everyone in this city, from employees to small businesses, to residents. Everybody is going to share in the sacrifice from what is being proposed here and what is facing us over the next fiscal year. I want to compliment \nSPEAKER_00:  My colleagues on the Budget Oversight Committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice Chair Price and \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember Yoronga for there. \nSPEAKER_00:  their professionalism, their support. \nSPEAKER_00:  their collegiality and for really digging in and understanding our fiscal \nSPEAKER_00:  situation here in the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  as a budget over side committee and also want to come in our staff who has worked around the clock. \nSPEAKER_00:  Mmm-hmm. \nSPEAKER_00:  Financial management team. \nSPEAKER_00:  led by Jion Gross. I've had to privilege to work very closely with \nSPEAKER_00:  Grace you. \nSPEAKER_00:  And many others, and of course our city manager Tom Modica throughout this process. \nSPEAKER_00:  um in \nSPEAKER_00:  I've also talked to many every one of our City Council members and taking their input into consideration. \nSPEAKER_00:  We've had a number of community budget meetings. \nSPEAKER_00:  Budget hearings, what we heard from the public. \nSPEAKER_00:  And all of that has gone into consideration to get us to this point where we are. \nSPEAKER_00:  today. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so with that, \nSPEAKER_00:  Again, I'd like to move. \nSPEAKER_00:  for \nSPEAKER_00:  Consideration and approval by the Budget Overtite Committee, the following recommendations. I want to ask, \nSPEAKER_00:  wish you to share that on the \nSPEAKER_00:  The screen on the SharePoint for those participating to see on the WebX. \nSPEAKER_00:  \u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 oder \u0648\u0644\u0627 \nSPEAKER_00:  Get that up. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, I believe share the recommendation. Are people able to see that? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, they're first up. So. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion A, in there are several motions here. We're going to make it one universal motion. OK, but there's a motion to support Mayor Garcia's proposed budget recommendations with the following changes. And that is to add the African American Cultural Center is one of the organizations receiving support and revise the allocation of funds as presented before you. \nSPEAKER_00:  This would essentially give $60,000 to \nSPEAKER_00:  One, two, three, four, five, six arts organizations, including the \nSPEAKER_00:  the African American Cultural Center, the Kamarata Singers of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach Playhouse. \nSPEAKER_00:  music and jellica. \nSPEAKER_00:  the International City Theater and the Long Beach Opera. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then $120,000. And this is all coming from measure B. \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach Museum of Art, it's a Long Beach Symphony Orchestra. \nSPEAKER_00:  the Museum of Latin American Art. \nSPEAKER_00:  The musical theater west and then $17,000 a 1% for the Measure B budget stabilization fund. And I'd like to just say thank the mayor for his input and support. On these recommendations, I've worked very closely with him to come up with a formula that works and it's fair for all of our arts organizations. This will be a great benefit to our city. \nSPEAKER_00:  The second motion is to delay the transfer of the hard teams from the Fire Department to the Health Department for an estimated six months until staff reports to City Council on the details of the proposed new model and plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  including information on how the transition will be implemented with no gaps in service. \nSPEAKER_00:  how the plants compare to net. \nSPEAKER_00:  national best practices and how \nSPEAKER_00:  if any medical regulations, requirements are required. \nSPEAKER_00:  or I'm sorry, requirements are being addressed. \nSPEAKER_00:  Recognize one time savings in the health department of 207,000 dollars. \nSPEAKER_00:  $200, $200, $200, $200. And \nSPEAKER_00:  at one time cost of the fire department of 435. \nSPEAKER_00:  $1232 resulting from the delay. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the total citywide impact to the general fund of 228,000. \nSPEAKER_00:  $32. \nSPEAKER_00:  C is a motion to revise the proposed business license increase on cannabis businesses from 1% increase to a 5% increase. And extend, I'm sorry, to a 0.5% increase.

Staff should report back to the City Council during FY21 with a status update. \nSPEAKER_00:  and bear with me. \nSPEAKER_00:  En de moois in IEM. \nSPEAKER_00:  is to request the city manager to study and report back to the city council during FY21 on options. \nSPEAKER_00:  for restructuring library services, including the potential of expanding library hours at some locations. \nSPEAKER_00:  Studies should include usage. \nSPEAKER_00:  Statistics. \nSPEAKER_00:  Building conditions, changing usage of library facilities. \nSPEAKER_00:  and other factors appropriate for decision making or future changes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion in is to request the city manager to study and report back to the city council during FY21 on potential organizational changes that will reduce costs for FY22 with the least impact on services and ability to manage and control operations and finances. \nSPEAKER_00:  Boon, een olpook ongaan. \nSPEAKER_00:  The motion is to request the city manager whole position is vacant, where practical and feasible. \nSPEAKER_00:  to maximize vacancy savings. \nSPEAKER_00:  in FY21 and to prepare for potential staffing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Reductions in 20 \nSPEAKER_00:  2 FY22. \nSPEAKER_00:  And the last motion is P. \nSPEAKER_00:  In total, there's a general-flung group structural impact of 470. \nSPEAKER_00:  487. \nSPEAKER_00:  $574 offset by net one time savings of $487, $574.

We can move. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can. Um, \nSPEAKER_00:  Get a second on the motion and we can open it up for discussion. \nSPEAKER_00:  So which second emotion? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, thank you, Councilmember Uranga. \nSPEAKER_00:  So with that, I'd open it up for... \nSPEAKER_00:  discussion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, if we go back to item I. \nSPEAKER_04:  I had previously asked at the last budget meeting regarding \nSPEAKER_04:  cuts to city council offices that would be \nSPEAKER_04:  In my opinion, a bit draconian in the sense that we would have to \nSPEAKER_04:  have \nSPEAKER_04:  God, that would be great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Borses. \nSPEAKER_04:  to cut staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I see that now. \nSPEAKER_04:  We. \nSPEAKER_04:  had an increase. \nSPEAKER_04:  Another percentage point from 4 to 5. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  um \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there? \nSPEAKER_04:  But I'm looking for basically an opportunity to \nSPEAKER_04:  have council offices be able to give them. \nSPEAKER_04:  be able to uh \nSPEAKER_04:  make a budget that according to what they had in their budgets. \nSPEAKER_04:  some of the council offices have much more. \nSPEAKER_04:  are leeway than others. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I would hope that it could be proportional as opposed to straight across. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's my counter. \nSPEAKER_00:  Is that the comment or was that a question for staff? \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, basically, I guess it will be a question for staff. And we could do something that I don't rather than illustrate across. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Some comfortable offices are like a better in better position to make those candidates. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's where I'll turn that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I know last week we... \nSPEAKER_00:  We took those into consideration and \nSPEAKER_00:  believe there might have been some response and even in our \nSPEAKER_00:  to for a firm that you received recently from the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then I think I'm good enough to see that \nSPEAKER_00:  But as I understood the issue, it was... \nSPEAKER_00:  It was almost impossible to budget in that way because you said yourself that every office is managed a little differently. There may be some. And I think what we heard last week was that it is difficult to carry savings over from a previous year and put it into a budget in a... \nSPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hello? \nSPEAKER_00:  in the current year. So that \nSPEAKER_00:  That may create a... \nSPEAKER_00:  and I'll let staff talk, speak to that as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Grace, do you have anything on that? Is that possible? Again, we want to work with the... \nSPEAKER_00:  The members. \nSPEAKER_00:  idea here. \nSPEAKER_00:  if I got it right. \nSPEAKER_07:  or \nSPEAKER_07:  Are you able to hear me? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, great. \nSPEAKER_07:  So just a couple comments for the committee to take under consideration. The recommendation, as I understand it from the BOC right now, from the draft version that you read is for structural reduction, additional structural reduction, to be taken by the elected offices. \nSPEAKER_07:  As was the discussion last week, there is a desire to carry over surplus funds from year end. That would only be a one-time action. That is something that this committee or the council can consider. It does not actually have to be tonight as well if there's some discussions on what to do with year end surplus. The issue was raised last year. That's something that can be addressed at year end when we actually know what the status of each of the districts either overages or underages are. Also in terms of doing the structural budget cuts. \nSPEAKER_07:  differently, there is a policy by. \nSPEAKER_07:  City Council to have equal budgets across the council districts. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's the equalization policy. So that would be something that the council would have to say is something different that they would want to now have council districts have different adopted, budgeted levels. So that's another point of consideration. But for the moment in terms of looking, I believe what the issue of a council member, Uronga Rae's last year was Year and Sir Plus. That's again something that could be looked at at year end in terms of how to utilize those funds. Let me know what's the status for FY20. And also the point with that would be that those are just one time funds if there is a Sir Plus. \nSPEAKER_07:  and the current recommendation is looking at structural reduction. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_00:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Mr. Chair, I just want to go ahead and \nSPEAKER_04:  on set aside with the answer given by you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let me see you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hey. \nSPEAKER_00:  I just had to follow up to that. If by chance a budget was came in under at the end of the year for one of these council offices and what it would be. \nSPEAKER_00:  They could very much go to the full council and ask for those funds to be used toward their office operations. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Correct. If it counts, currently the policy is that any year and surplus, and this is just for the account of the strip. \nSPEAKER_07:  Currently, if there is any surplus, it automatically rolls over to a council district divide by nine funding allocation, but if a council district or the council body as a whole wanted to approve the different use of those funds, including adding to a district operating budget, that could be discussed at that time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for that clarification. \nSPEAKER_00:  Any more quick questions, Council Member? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, I have to start with the response. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, thank you. Council Member Price? Vice Chair Price, sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you chair Austin. I want to \nSPEAKER_08:  I want to support the motion. I do have a couple of questions regarding some of the elements of the motion. The fireworks task force, I think that's a great idea. It's definitely something every council district has had issues and concerns with and something that we've all tried to address locally in our own districts. I'm hoping that \nSPEAKER_08:  If that is an item that's approved this evening. \nSPEAKER_08:  source for community. \nSPEAKER_08:  option that that \nSPEAKER_08:  There's a lot of local efforts in the different districts, including the third district with the fireworks task force that I would love for them to be incorporated into whatever structure we give to this task force in terms of stakeholder feedback. \nSPEAKER_00:  So you're saying that you'd like to see some community stakeholder involvement in that process. \nSPEAKER_00:  You can't do it. You can't do it. \nSPEAKER_08:  \ub0a0\uc528\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_08:  You could discuss. \nSPEAKER_00:  You're cutting in and out. This is difficult. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  to do. \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember you. I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, you're cutting in and out. So it's kind of difficult to understand. \nSPEAKER_00:  What exactly? I think I heard that you'd like to see \nSPEAKER_00:  some community. \nSPEAKER_00:  stakeholder participation. \nSPEAKER_00:  in the task force working with the city's team. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice-tier. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice to your price are you with us? \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm with you. Can you not? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, we have an energy in about a minute and a half. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, my apologies. I can't hear you fine. I'm not sure what's happening. I'm parked right outside of City Hall. But what I was saying is that if this item is to be approved by the council tonight as part of the budget recommendations, then I would hope that we can come back. We can have a comeback by staff so that we can give it some structure and a framework to make sure that the different stakeholders throughout the city who have already been engaged in this conversation have input into the process moving forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  That makes sense to me. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. The other thing that I wanted to. \nSPEAKER_08:  to say is the restoration to the lifeguard and junior lifeguard programs. I think those are critical. And I'm hoping that once we get beyond this year, there's a lot more creativity brought to the table in terms of how we can \nSPEAKER_08:  do the programs and staff are beaches in a way that creative and understanding our budget shortfalls because the taisan's budget is going to be hit pretty dramatically over the course of the next few years and I want to make sure that we are looking long-term and not just in survival mode or reactionary to the year but that we're looking long-term for the future so with that I'm happy to support the recommendation tonight understanding that we're going to have to get creative for next year. \nSPEAKER_00:  I really know it and I do appreciate all of your input on those items to help us get to this recommendation this evening. With that said, we've heard from the public, we've heard from behind the rail, you've heard my motion. \nSPEAKER_00:  Let's go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_05:  Council Member Joronga. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Best Chair Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair Austin. All right. Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as I believe concludes our budget oversight committee meeting, these recommendations will be forwarded to the City Council. I'm discussed during a budget hearing during our City Council and \nSPEAKER_00:  I just again want to thank everybody for your indulgence and participation. \nSPEAKER_00:  and great collegiality. \nSPEAKER_00:  that he's very difficult times right now, based on our city, but I believe that this recommendation and the budget recommendations that we just passed, that will propose by the city manager and mayor, will get us through. \nSPEAKER_00:  an operational year in FY21 that has minimal impact. \nSPEAKER_00:  on our"
