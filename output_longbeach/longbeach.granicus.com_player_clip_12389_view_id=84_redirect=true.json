Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Next item, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Item 2 is a recommendation to receive and file a report from Economic Development Staff on 1st quarter, 2021, Economic Indicators. \nSPEAKER_00:  and sales tax study report for 2019 to 2020. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Just for a point of history, I remember fighting really hard to get access to this report. There was a time where a previous city manager said, council members really shouldn't be able to dig into the details of this. You can look at it at a high level. And I'm really proud of the fact that we have been able to get additional reports and detail that breaks out the city into lower levels by industry and geography. And I think our ability to compare ourselves to other cities and specifically by category really gives us an opportunity to focus our efforts on areas that have the highest opportunity for return on investment. So I'm excited to see this presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  May we have a staff report. \nSPEAKER_03:  Good afternoon city council members and it's great to bring back quarterly updates on the sales tax and economic indicators. I'm going to actually turn it over to our in-house expert Eric Romero, who is our business development officer, and tracks these measures as part of his own work plan. So Eric, you want to take it away? \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure, thank you, John. Good afternoon, a chair of the Economic Development and Finance Committee and members of the Economic Development and Finance Committee. I'm Eric Romero, I'm the city's business development officer. So today we'll provide to you just an economic indicators report, and the focus will be on sales tax revenue today. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as you know, we've mentioned before and as you're aware, the Economic Development and Finance Committee has received several local economic indicators presentations in the past. It's been some time since we've done some of these, so we're excited to present some new data to you today. Today's presentation will focus specifically, as I just mentioned, on sales tax revenue. So some of the data that we'll be looking at is citywide sales tax revenue by fiscal year. We'll look at sales tax revenue comparisons across different geographic areas, like the County of Los Angeles, the state of California, Southern California, some other cities that have been recommended by our sales tax consultant, HDL companies. We'll also look at sales tax surplus in gap comparison by retail categories in the past. We've referred to these as sales tax leakage reports. And then we'll look at sales tax revenue by major industry groups, and then we'll provide a brief overview of AB147, which is the Marketplace Facilitator Act that has impacted some of the city's sales tax revenues. And so we'll cover some of those details. We'll also end the presentation with some questions for you all. So now that we're going to get back into the swing of providing these quarterly economic indicator reports, we'd like to hear from you all exactly what data you would like for us to look into and report to you on a quarterly basis. And if it all possible, we would like to standardize the indicators that we are sharing with you. Of course, if there are special requests, we will do our best to do our research and assess what information we can make available to you all so that we can present at the different economic indicators. So we'll end with a little bit of a brainstorming session. It's that's okay with you all. \nSPEAKER_01: \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0627\u0644 dabei \nSPEAKER_01:  So this first slide here looks at sales tax revenue by fiscal year. And we'll look at the last three years or the last two years and then FY21 as well. So from FY18 to FY19, we had a 2.7% increase. So a moderate increase in our sales tax revenue citywide. And we did see a 7.6% decrease from FY19 to FY20. I think it's safe to say that a lot of that decrease was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our local economy. Though I think the decrease was not as large as we might have imagined. And we'll talk to some of the reasons why later in this presentation. And for FY21 budget, there was a projection of about 3.5% increase from FY20 to FY21. And we don't have a full year's worth of FY21 data yet. But we're very curious to have that data commenced so that we can present the new and improved latest figures for you all going forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll jump now into these comparisons across different geographic areas. So in this chart, we're looking at, you know, Long Beach compared to Los Angeles County, the general Southern California area and also the state of California overall. And so you can see that, you know, here on the chart that Long Beach has historically underperformed when you compare it to LA County, Southern California and the state of California, which we see here, there've been a few dips and I think it's safe to say that again, some of the dips from 4Q19, but especially 1Q2020 to about 3Q2020, were in large part due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our local economy. One thing that you will see here in this chart is that over the last three quarters, so the third quarter of 2020, the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, we see that the per capita sales tax, that's been generated here in the city of Long Beach has stabilized for the most part. In some of the other areas that we're looking at here, there was an increase and then, currently on a decline. So it's interesting, they added it to see there and of course there's still some work to do to better understand, you know, the reasons behind some of the stabilizations in Long Beach compared to some of the other geographic areas that we're looking at here in this chart. \nSPEAKER_01:  So now we'll look at some cities that were recommended in an unincorporated area of LA County that was recommended by HDL companies, our sales tax provider that we contract with. So you can see that that Long Beach has historically performed stronger than Oakland and unincorporated LA County and Long Beach is a thick green line here on this chart. Long Beach continues to underperform compared to Sacramento. It looks like we have underperformed at least going back to the first quarter of 2018, a per the chart. And as I mentioned in the last slide as well, you do see that Long Beach has again over the last three quarters stabilized in terms of a per capita sales tax revenue that's generated. But that in these other cities you've seen kind of moderate increases from about three Q, a third quarter of 2020 to fourth quarter of 2020. But they're all currently declining. And we can see that sales Sacramento is declining at a faster rate than some of the other areas that are listed here in the city or on this chart. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what we have here, and on this chart, is the per capita sales tax surplus and gap comparison. This is what we've referred to in the past as a sales tax leakage report. So the chart looks at per capita sales tax generated across retail categories, a variety of retail categories. Here, I know it can be a little hard to see on the screen, but hopefully it's okay to see it with the presentation in front of you. And a retail surplus suggests that the community's capturing its local market for the category of goods, plus attracting additional shoppers from outside of the city of Long Beach. So there's the general kind of a net gain, and we're capturing our local share plus sum. A retail gap suggests that residents may have a greater demand for certain products in a specific category than is being satisfied by local businesses here in the city of Long Beach. And the information is provided really as a starting point in identifying some new opportunities based on, really only on Long Beach's population here that we're seeing. So there might be opportunities to possibly capture some sales tax revenue in some of the other retail categories or retail categories are listed here that are currently in a gap, where we're not capturing our fair share or local market share of the sales tax revenue. It over the years, really, as we deliver these presentations, for the most part, most of our retail categories that we've had a gap in as opposed to a surplus in. And currently, Long Beach has a surplus in casual dining, grocery stores, convenient stores, and liquor stores, and also fast casual restaurants. These have been some of the same categories that we've seen a surplus in the past. And we have the largest gaps in lumber and building materials, discount department stores, and electronics, and appliance stores. And the data is from the first quarter of 2021 going back for three other quarters. So it's about April 2020 to March 2021. Is what we're looking at here today. And the next step for us really is to look at the comparison of the first quarter of 2021 data going back a few quarters, to the first quarter of 2020 data going back a few quarters to see what the comparisons look like so that we can see the changes in the different retail categories and whether it's been a surplus or a gap. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this next slide here, we aggregate some of the retail categories. We had a longer list in the last chart. Here we have a larger grouping of the different categories by industry groups. So we see that we have comparisons of the first quarter of 2021 data going back for four quarters. And then first quarter, 20 data and going back a few quarters as well. So we're going to call it 2020 versus 2021, just to simplify it for the purposes of this presentation. And we can see that there's only been an increase in a few industry groups. So the state and county pools, which we're going to dig into more a little later in this presentation, and then food and drugs. And I think it's slide possibly 15 or 17 in your presentation. We also have some, the major industry groups listed by some of the smaller retail categories, so that you can see, you know, the types of businesses that are included in the different industry groups. But just just an example, in food and drugs, we have food stores that are non-grushory. We also have grocery stores. We have convenience and liquor stores. We also have a cannabis related sales tax revenue as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we had again a 34% increase in state and county pools, a 17% increase in food and drugs, and that does industry groups. We have seen decreases, pretty substantial decreases in restaurants and hotels, 31% decrease in this case, which speaks to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our local hospitality industry. Have seen a substantial decrease in fuel and service stations. So I imagine while we still need to dig into the details, I imagine that people weren't driving as much and working from home had an impact on that revenue that was generated, and then there was an 8% decrease on business and industry, which there's a lot of retail categories that are listed under that category of there. \nSPEAKER_01:  So let's dig in a little more into the pretty, pretty big increase in the state and county pools. So that is the share of tax revenue, that the per-radity share of tax revenue that the city gets from the state, tax revenue collected from the state and tax revenue collected from the county of Los Angeles. And I just wanna remind the council members that the financial management department they could provide and complete FY 20 year end budget report that spoke to some of the increases. And they spoke about the implementation of AB 147, which is the Marketplace Facilitators Act, and also the boost in online sales that resulted in, you know, due to the pandemic and people being hesitant to shop in person, and then of course the impacts of local state health orders on business operations. So AB 147 again is the Marketplace Facilitators Act. This required out-of-state retailers that meet specific requirements to collect and remit California's sales, use and transactions tax. While it was effective April 1st, 2019, Marketplace Facilitators that will define shortly were not required to begin reporting until October 1st, 2019. And basically as of October 2019, they were required to collect and remit taxes for out-of-state sellers who contract with them, directly or indirectly to facilitate sales. \nSPEAKER_01:  So a marketplace facilitator is a business that provides any of the following services. So payment processing, fulfillment, or storage services. List of products or sell, set prices, they take orders, or they provide customer service, or assist with returns or exchanges. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what you see now on the screen here, and some information that we got from HDL, again, the firm that we contract with to get all of the sales tax information, also some insights that we get from them as well. And they estimate that across the state of California, over 26 billion in taxable sales has been reported through new AB 147 accounts, and that it generated about $1.9 billion in state-wide sales and use tax revenue. And that again, you know, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the restrictions they had on business operations, did also boost online sales of remote sellers, and these marketplace facilitators that we keep talking about. And some examples of marketplace facilitators, or AB 147 tax payers include Amazon, \nSPEAKER_01:  at sea, there's Alibaba, there's Google, there are a whole lot of them out there that are facilitating these exchanges, self-reduced of goods and services, and ultimately, all of this activity has now generated new tax revenue that the city of Long Beach has benefited from. And you can see here by this table or this infographic on the left-hand side that local jurisdictions received about $260 million estimated in the state of California from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the third quarter of 2020 due to the changes that resulted after the implementation of AB 147. \nSPEAKER_01:  And here is one more just chart that shows, the revenue that did come in as a result of AB147 across the state of California and the state and county pools. And also a projection of the revenue that would have come in without the implementation of AB147. So the yellow line is what has projected that would have come in without the implementation of AB147. And the green line is what did end up coming in. \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe this one here might be actually the last chart that we have here on the Cells Tax Revenue Report that we're delivering to you today. And again, it's the four quarters, last four quarters with the first quarter of 2021 being the latest quarter that's being captured here. And we see that the top five industry groups are business and industry. And again, we have reference in the presentation that describes some of the retail categories within the industry group, state and county pools, general consumer goods, restaurants and hotels and food and drugs. Some additional homework that we need to do to better understand the nuances or the changes. The nuances we might be able to speak to with restaurants and hotels and food and drugs that especially restaurants and hotels were impacted by the pandemic is whether they've changed over time in being the top five industry groups that we have the most Cells Tax Revenue that's being collected for these groups. So you have that pie chart here in front of you that shows that data and the breakdowns and the first business and industry is about 23% of the overall Cells Tax Revenue that was collected here by major industry group here in this city. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I'll pause there and then maybe we can jump into these questions that we have about future economic indicators reports. After any questions that you might have about the sales tax revenue information we just shared, I will just say that part of our drive is to also manage expectations about what we can and can answer. So we'll answer what we can and anything that we can answer will circle back with you as soon as possible with that information. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So um... \nSPEAKER_04:  Love the report. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Mr. Chrysler and I were only able to meet a week and a half ago. So HDL had a very short turnaround time for providing the reports. I would like to see the sales tax revenue broken out by corridor. I think we've made some great investments in certain parts of the city. And those investments need to be seen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  We've made investments in Uptown. \nSPEAKER_04:  Douglas Park. \nSPEAKER_04:  Central Long Beach, downtown, all those areas, and we need to be able to see that progress, and it should mirror the city wide. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm interested in knowing which categories were hit most by FY20 when I look at chart 3. And I think the only way you're really going to know that is if you do a year over your comparison. And I know that when you break out those \nSPEAKER_04:  geographic areas and then the rest of the city is in one line. I don't know if we ever were able to grab that. It really gives you a bigger picture so I think that that'll be helpful. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  When I look at page four. \nSPEAKER_04:  I see what I already know as the tradition of the people. \nSPEAKER_04:  that I have come from in lineage and many other peers. My grandfather. \nSPEAKER_04:  My grandmother on both sides, they both owned businesses or worked in the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  and they lived in this city and then they produced my parents who \nSPEAKER_04:  hardworking business owners and then a public servant like my mother. \nSPEAKER_04:  They're frugal people. \nSPEAKER_04:  When you see this chart, you see that when you take what other people spend. \nSPEAKER_04:  in Southern California. \nSPEAKER_04:  in Northern California, anywhere in California, and then you take what Long Beach residents spend. \nSPEAKER_04:  We are a frugal people. \nSPEAKER_04:  and um \nSPEAKER_04:  I feel like that's what I've always known. And I think that that's similar to some of our adjacent areas, like Lakewood and Signal Hill and a lot of that. It's just a community feel of frugality. And even though we mirror the state and the highs and the lows, overall, even if you were to contrast us with the revenues per capita or the earnings per capita, I think you'd still see a stark difference because we, \nSPEAKER_04:  We're very philanthropic. I know that we've talked a lot about that on the nonprofit side and how people in the city give a lot. And we can afford to give because we don't spend money. So I think that that's a very interesting slide. \nSPEAKER_04:  I also think that when I look at some of these numbers and the rebounds, I think about shortages. So you look at certain cities that are having bigger hits. The categories that they're dominant in are often the categories that either transitioned most or are currently having shortages. Like Sacramento, from what I understand, has a huge car sales component of their sales tax revenue. \nSPEAKER_04:  and there aren't any cars right now. Car sales are bottomed out and... \nSPEAKER_04:  You can't sell cars you don't have. And so I'd be interested to dive into those details, but I don't think that that's necessary. But I think that. \nSPEAKER_04:  should HDL have been here since they do manage these contracts for so many cities, they'd probably anecdotally be able to answer those questions. \nSPEAKER_04:  What I talk about the gaps. \nSPEAKER_04:  Throughout our city's history, we've said yes and no to certain things. And there are industries that we've really adopted. And I think that this goes to something that Councilmember Richardson and I talked about in 2015. \nSPEAKER_04:  On our borders of our city, we've got a bunch of home depots, we've got good, good, good, all, and then we've got \nSPEAKER_04:  So let's talk about that side of it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Neighbors shop at lows. \nSPEAKER_04:  Neighbors shop at Aeshardware, neighbor shop at Aes. But contractors shop at Home Depot. So Mr. Richardson and I talked about what can we do as a council to kind of bring some added convenience to contractors at Lowe's. And we talked about and brought forward to the council an idea of an electronic permit counter. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the city said at that time it would be impossible because nothing was digital. \nSPEAKER_04:  But now it is digital. Let's incentivize contractors to use the pro desk at Lowe's again. Let's talk about you being able to pull a roofing contract. \nSPEAKER_04:  ATLOS. \nSPEAKER_04:  instead of everyone going to South Coast shingle in \nSPEAKER_04:  Los Alamedos or the other one that's over in Lakewood or Signal Hill. You've got one in Long Beach in North Long Beach. Let's talk to the three or four majors. \nSPEAKER_04:  I mean, roofing is out of control right now. Everywhere I go. \nSPEAKER_04:  Rufs everywhere. Just people have money because obviously we don't spend any of it. So neighbors are making those investments. They're putting in pools. They're putting in roofs. They're putting in AC units. \nSPEAKER_04:  We need to be in the places we want contractors to go. \nSPEAKER_04:  If a contractor could go to lows. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're going to City Hall and deal with the parking. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the tiny parking spaces that don't fit contractor's trucks. Thank you for City Hall for making a few spots wider for them. \nSPEAKER_04:  They'll code lows and then we can get that additional revenue. So let's work on something like that again. Let's pull that old agenda item. \nSPEAKER_04:  and if ED&F can come back and... \nSPEAKER_04:  and let us know if you can work with development services and bring the idea that \nSPEAKER_04:  As a member Richardson and I brought to you in 2015 back to life, because the barriers that we were told were in our way are no longer there. \nSPEAKER_04:  Electronics that appliances are really changing. \nSPEAKER_04:  It would be interesting to me because \nSPEAKER_04:  So many of the moms that I know buy their electronics that target anyway. So I think that this category is a little deceiving because obviously we don't have a best buy. We don't have an electronic store. Radio Shack doesn't exist anymore. We've lost all of those in the last 10 years. \nSPEAKER_04:  So it's a very different environment. \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't know how that really compares unless we were to take \nSPEAKER_04:  best buy at our vacant Osh or our vacant K-Mart or one of those and I don't see that happening because the positioning of the investments that those retailers already have. \nSPEAKER_04:  I also see best by really raining in on and transitioning into the appliance industry, which we typically did better at. We had some major appliance stores, but now the electronic stores are kind of buying up some of that retail because they're losing some of their market share. So I think that that's something we need to talk about. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have a prior VP of Best Buy. That's a business owner in our city. So you can hear these stories and potentially we can learn from and compete with. \nSPEAKER_04:  and really market to what we need in our vacancies. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think noting that cannabis dropped into the general. \nSPEAKER_04:  consumers just explains all of that. \nSPEAKER_04:  So no additional information, but I will say the building and construction \nSPEAKER_04:  decline, I would also guess is because of shortages. I mean, the price of plywood is up 300%. \nSPEAKER_04:  and there isn't any plywood to be found, so it's hard for us to... \nSPEAKER_04:  Sell it, though if you do sell it, you'd make three times the sales tax revenue you used to make. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  AB 147 is very interesting to me. I'm really interested in learning how that percentage is broken out. Is it broken out by number of sales per jurisdiction? Is it broken out by percentage of gross receipts? \nSPEAKER_04:  Is it broken out by? \nSPEAKER_04:  How is that done? So if we could learn a little bit more about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  You talked about AB 147 creating new revenue. I would be very careful with that language. I think really it's... \nSPEAKER_04:  providing a backfill on the revenue that we lost due to the transition. \nSPEAKER_04:  and until I know the formula, I won't know if we're getting. \nSPEAKER_04:  and equal amount. When I look at this chart and I see local jurisdiction 1%, \nSPEAKER_04:  Shouldn't it be 2% because I'm measuring? \nSPEAKER_04:  or is the state percentage a set amount, no matter what jurisdiction? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, and so. \nSPEAKER_04:  What? \nSPEAKER_04:  strategies might we have in the future legislatively. \nSPEAKER_04:  as technology improves once the technology, once the collections are there to better categorize that data. \nSPEAKER_04:  to improve that. \nSPEAKER_04:  especially because when you go to buy something online. \nSPEAKER_04:  you tell them where you're shipping it to and they know that we are 10.25% \nSPEAKER_04:  So they're collecting 10.25. And if you say you're in a different jurisdiction, they're saying that other amounts. So then the other. \nSPEAKER_04:  jurisdictions are having the benefit of our measure a passage. So just some thoughts. \nSPEAKER_04:  And when it's billions of dollars, it starts to make a difference. \nSPEAKER_04:  Otherwise um \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm really interested in poverty rates. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I'm also really interested in... \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  cash on hand ability to invest, right? We talk about how frugal we are. \nSPEAKER_04:  That also means that those with high disposable incomes that don't spend \nSPEAKER_04:  are potentially accumulating wealth? \nSPEAKER_04:  But with a rate of inflation, they might not be. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so it'd be interesting to see what that looks like in our city. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then the potential for wealth transfer. We talk a lot about \nSPEAKER_04:  the ability to transfer wealth from one generation to another. And a big part of that is if you have money in the bank right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  and inflation is growing at a faster rate than interest. You're losing the ability to buy by the day. \nSPEAKER_04:  but perhaps you are invested in the home that you own. \nSPEAKER_04:  and real estate's advancing at that same rate. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then potentially upon. \nSPEAKER_04:  transition in age. \nSPEAKER_04:  You can pass that down a generation, but with 60% of our city being renters, what are we doing as a city? \nSPEAKER_04:  to really invest in. \nSPEAKER_04:  and incentivize. \nSPEAKER_04:  apartment owners to turn into condos and allow for the people who live in them today to buy them. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we hear a lot of... \nSPEAKER_04:  Community members come forward and say, I don't want my rent to increase. \nSPEAKER_04:  but I want to be able to fix my carpet or any of these things. Well, \nSPEAKER_04:  The way we do that is we take those apartment buildings and we turn them into condos. And we say, okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here's your mortgage amount and it's going to be that for 30 years. And not only will it not increase, but at the end of the 30 years. \nSPEAKER_04:  You won't pay anymore. So when you move onto security, \nSPEAKER_04:  you'll be able to live because my mom's living on $800 a month right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that's a tough thing to do as an elderly person. \nSPEAKER_04:  when you don't have control of your expenses. \nSPEAKER_04:  and with the price of inflation impacting gas and all these other areas. \nSPEAKER_04:  specifically building supplies. How are landlords gonna be able to make those improvements? \nSPEAKER_04:  unless there's like that co-ownership opportunity for the people who live there to be able to buy their future. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we need to look at how we help them. \nSPEAKER_04:  own and then \nSPEAKER_04:  acquire wealth so that they can be debt-free and be a senior citizen with a disposable income. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I see no cues. Oh, there we go. Vice Mayor Richardson. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair, Mungo. Just a couple things, great perspectives that you're offering here. First question. So how, I know that you can't get into specific businesses, specific business revenue. But how far can you drill down? \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure, that's a good question. So we can't, we have to be really careful about sharing any confidential data. So we don't want to, in any way, be able to share information about how much one specific business is generating for a variety of reasons, you know, market competition is certainly part of that. But we do have some information that I believe we've shared in the past around like the top 12 sales tax generators here in the city of Long Beach. We can certainly to councilwoman Mugga's point, identify specific geographic areas in the city. And as long as there is not so small that you can, you know, call identify certain businesses within that that we can ultimately provide sales tax revenue and trends over time information. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, here's what I'm interested in. Long Beach State did the economic, quarterly economical, 40 years ago. And it was looking at by zip code, you know, how we all \nSPEAKER_05:  you know, how different areas were doing it. I thought that was great. \nSPEAKER_05:  First time I've seen \nSPEAKER_05:  very specifically how my neighborhood was built. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  I would love to see. \nSPEAKER_05:  even a little more granular. \nSPEAKER_05:  If we were to see... \nSPEAKER_05:  Where we see \nSPEAKER_05:  sales, revenues, receipts, spiking in the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  I want to see where they are so we can \nSPEAKER_05:  directly pinpointed to was there a new development? \nSPEAKER_05:  was there something that changed? \nSPEAKER_05:  So we can replicate it. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I would love to see a report. \nSPEAKER_05:  next time. \nSPEAKER_05:  As shows. \nSPEAKER_05:  Where are the spikes? \nSPEAKER_05:  where have during the pandemic \nSPEAKER_05:  or even coming out of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_05:  who are the leaders. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right? \nSPEAKER_05:  How are they trending and what's happening? \nSPEAKER_05:  so we can go back and help tell that story. \nSPEAKER_05:  and share that success and amplify that success. That's the first thing. You think that's possible? \nSPEAKER_04:  Can I add to that, Council Member Richardson? Go for it. \nSPEAKER_05:  go for it. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I remember back to a separate report and so I'm gonna just kind of dive in. I can't remember uh... \nSPEAKER_04:  We were talking about spikes. And I believe you and I were discussing specifically around vacancies. And so at the time, \nSPEAKER_04:  The town center had some vacancies and one business left and everyone was panicked because they were afraid of the huge loss. But it ended up that the previous store and I think that there was some law that you can provide this data so help me work through this. The previous store had six million a year in grocery seats. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the new replacement store had 40 million a year in grocery seats. And so year over year you didn't I'm sorry quarter over quarter you didn't see that because of the move in dates and all that. But they or URI individually can look at the data by location. It just can't be shared in a public forum for competitive needs. However, many of these businesses do report their \nSPEAKER_04:  gross receipts expectation across the industry. \nSPEAKER_04:  based on square footage. So when we were trying to recruit, I cannot remember the name of the per store that Sujo was so excited to bring in, but they were at $1,500 per square foot grocery seats annually. It was something super high. It wasn't good. \nSPEAKER_04:  Coach, you want to say it's like Michael Cours. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we did this whole big presentation. They didn't end up coming. But \nSPEAKER_04:  Specifically, you can go into that data as a council member. \nSPEAKER_04:  It just can't be given in a public forum. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. And the reason I ask is, I mean, it's how we use this stuff. Right? We have local council members who want to know what works, what can they do? \nSPEAKER_05:  replicate success. We should be able to buy data, look and say this is a successful story. \nSPEAKER_05:  Do more of it. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's the narrative I'm looking for. \nSPEAKER_05:  As council members, a lot of times we just look at the square of our district and say, I like, I remember when I worked for Steve Neal and we first started out, we were just looking at what was working across the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that's where the Uptown Business District idea came from. We said, look at what Blair is doing. \nSPEAKER_05:  Look it downtown. \nSPEAKER_05:  We don't have one. \nSPEAKER_05:  everywhere that's working has one, let's start one. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that took up most of their time, just looking at success. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you are able to pinpoint \nSPEAKER_05:  more specifically. \nSPEAKER_05:  you know. \nSPEAKER_05:  how from an economic standpoint, how these things actually \nSPEAKER_05:  Read More Comers. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think there's a lot we can pull from there. What happens to crime? \nSPEAKER_05:  on that corridor when it's more active. \nSPEAKER_05:  what happens to \nSPEAKER_05:  attracting more investment to the area. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's the trends I want to see. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that was the first thing. The second thing in the last thing I would say is \nSPEAKER_05:  I love that we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_05:  Taxes, isn't it? \nSPEAKER_05:  uh... chair mongo you talk specifically about you know that one percent \nSPEAKER_05:  I think in general, and I've been having this conversation across the region, and I don't know that this is the right committee to talk about it, but... \nSPEAKER_05:  I think we have to talk about. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um, the tax code in the state. \nSPEAKER_05:  It does not incentivize production or growth. \nSPEAKER_04:  or investment in jobs. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, let me just make this point. Let me just make this point. \nSPEAKER_05:  We saw last year. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well revenue, stop. \nSPEAKER_05:  Transit occupancy tax, dry up, sales tax, dry up. You know, for the most part, property tax was pretty level everywhere. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  But that's our bread and butter in a local city. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's our bread and butter. That's how we provide services, police and fire and all those things. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  at the same time. \nSPEAKER_05:  We saw. \nSPEAKER_05:  record, so our plus is at the state. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is the second time in three years that we saw record surpluses at the state, when every city. \nSPEAKER_05:  Every city who bounced their budget based on \nSPEAKER_05:  sales tax and these other things. \nSPEAKER_05:  are not incentivized to do. \nSPEAKER_05:  the public policy goals that we have. \nSPEAKER_05:  If you build housing. \nSPEAKER_05:  people are gonna say. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm gonna pay for the police of fire, the sewers, the parks. \nSPEAKER_05:  because I'm not incentivized by building housing. \nSPEAKER_05:  But if we were to get a greater share or get a portion of in contacts. \nSPEAKER_05:  and exchange for something else. \nSPEAKER_05:  then you're going to be incentivized. \nSPEAKER_05:  Your city and its end of itself will be more interested not only in growth \nSPEAKER_05:  because the sheer body of a working adult coming in will \nSPEAKER_05:  help \nSPEAKER_05:  you provide services to your city. \nSPEAKER_05:  But secondly, you're going to be invested in how much money people make. \nSPEAKER_05:  not you're incentivized to \nSPEAKER_05:  Be poverty. \nSPEAKER_05:  because the better your people do. \nSPEAKER_05:  The more services you can provide. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now the state is not going to initiate that conversation. \nSPEAKER_05:  cities actually. \nSPEAKER_04:  city seminar. \nSPEAKER_05:  that conversation and it's a very nuanced, delicate conversation because you don't want to take away from schools. \nSPEAKER_05:  So there has to be a broader conversation, I think coming out of COVID. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now is the time. \nSPEAKER_05:  to have some blue ribbon panel. \nSPEAKER_05:  of cities who are across the state are willing to have that kind of conversation. \nSPEAKER_05:  with the state. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's appropriate it came up here, but there is a... \nSPEAKER_05:  StateLedge, part of this conversation. \nSPEAKER_05:  This conversation certainly needs to happen. It's already happening in some cities. \nSPEAKER_05:  But not these. \nSPEAKER_05:  In my opinion. \nSPEAKER_05:  John, we should really be thinking about. \nSPEAKER_05:  how we go back to the state and talk about a better deal. \nSPEAKER_05:  because this is not the pandemic has shown us that cities are less resilient now based on the way that we are structured. And we're the front door on services, front door on poverty, front door on homelessness, all of the things we're the front door but we're the last to be paid. And it makes no sense to it to me. So that's just some food for thought on where we should be taking this tax conversation in my opinion. Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you and um. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate the formality, but I'm also just... \nSPEAKER_04:  chime in if you ever want to chime in because Rex and I could go on forever with our old stories. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that there'd be some value in a short presentation. I do a lot of time with my developers. So like I sit down with. \nSPEAKER_04:  Burnham and Goodman and all of them and I talk about their strategy and I ask them their questions and what are their ideal real tailors and why and could you consider this or that and why don't you look at this or that and we kind of walk through. There's a lot about the symbiotic relationship. \nSPEAKER_04:  of different things together. So you take long beach exchange and when you talk to, I talk to Steve in the other day for, I don't know, hour and a half. \nSPEAKER_04:  when you look at \nSPEAKER_04:  the things that are in Long Beach Exchange, many of them exist all up and down the state, whether it's a Susie cakes or a handles or a tastier, \nSPEAKER_04:  And what's the other one? The hamburger with the pastrami on it. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's the highest grossing of each of those stores. \nSPEAKER_04:  in the region. \nSPEAKER_04:  and often in the country. And so there's more to the story than just what are the ones that are going well? But what are the ones that are going well and what are the ones that go well together? So if you talk to the guy who used to be the VP of... \nSPEAKER_04:  Dairy Queen used to pick the store locations. He does that for Starbucks now. You'll notice that there are some \nSPEAKER_04:  industries and store brands that don't have a guy that does that. So whenever you see a \nSPEAKER_04:  John Majuse, you'll see a bagel store next to it because the bagel store doesn't have a strategy and their strategy is our customers look like their customers. So let's go next door to them. \nSPEAKER_04:  and they kind of get that. And you go to these commercial. \nSPEAKER_04:  um broker forums. I've been to the one in \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't even remember, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  DLBA when I was chair before was like come with us and help us recruit Michael Cors or whoever they were recruiting and so we go to these conferences and just listen to people and what their ideas are and Then try to talk with them about the vacancies and the opportunities and what other things are there so I appreciate those things I appreciate how they work together \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I would like to see a property tax report. \nSPEAKER_04:  in my \nSPEAKER_04:  anecdotal and I don't know I know council member Richardson and I have the highest home ownership in the city \nSPEAKER_04:  home turnover this year. \nSPEAKER_04:  has been. \nSPEAKER_04:  Stray King. \nSPEAKER_04:  The number of people in the high end homes are retiring and moving out. \nSPEAKER_04:  that moving down sizing single flat family, whatever. \nSPEAKER_04:  The people in the middle homes are moving up. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the turnover is... \nSPEAKER_04:  astronomical. So \nSPEAKER_04:  If we want to reach out to George Drinky or Rex Hartlin at the assessor's office. \nSPEAKER_04:  and get a preliminary. \nSPEAKER_04:  prediction on property tax, I expect. \nSPEAKER_04:  amazing changes. I would say that supplemental tax bills this year are going to be at an all time high. They should be able to tell you year over year, supplemental tax bills in 18, 19, 20. You could talk about quantity, but you could also talk about percentages. Those should be easy reports for them to pull. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  And then income tax. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's a tricky conversation. \nSPEAKER_04:  But \nSPEAKER_04:  currently cities are incentivized to continue to do malls. \nSPEAKER_04:  and car dealers and furniture stores and electronic stores. Things that have a high amount \nSPEAKER_04:  per cart per checkout. And I agree that should not be our incentive. Consumption should not be a city's incentive. \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  We can't only rely on property tax. I've said this many times, though. I've been misinterpreted. A city's. \nSPEAKER_04:  fabric is really woven by the generations of people. \nSPEAKER_04:  that stay. \nSPEAKER_04:  and build families across neighborhoods and create that long-term consistency. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so. \nSPEAKER_04:  We do need to be incentivized to work. \nSPEAKER_04:  to improve the quality of life for their children. And I think that Long Beach was one of the first to start that with the Long Beach Promise. \nSPEAKER_04:  We recognize that people who live here love it and stay. \nSPEAKER_04:  and people who go to school here. \nSPEAKER_04:  stay here. And so we need to find a way to ensure that the programs out those schools aligned with the industries that we have, it's a lot with engineering and what we've done really well with space. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we're also making some big headway in medical. And Suely and I have started to talk about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  and what investments we can continue to make. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then I think the college promise really opens the door to say, we need to make sure that the people who's. \nSPEAKER_04:  Families are here. Have room to grow. \nSPEAKER_04:  and invest in education locally. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great report. I can't wait to see the next one. \nSPEAKER_04:  Did you have any additional? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I just want to pick you back off of the home ownership. I would definitely like to know. I know there \nSPEAKER_02:  especially in my district in the downtown area, there's been a lot of turnover, especially in the condos. Is there a way for us to know if those are our first time homeowners? \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we can look into it and see what data we can find. Report back. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll come to the floor for us. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, report back. And I also have a before we wrap up with this presentation because I know there are others that I'd like to recap some of the other indicators that have been discussed that we can present at a future presentation and maybe recommend a few others as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I would even encourage us to potentially look at if we're going to do a... \nSPEAKER_04:  Homeowner assessment shouldn't be hard to do. The realtors do a report of sales. \nSPEAKER_04:  It might be interesting to really offer a packet, a welcome packet. \nSPEAKER_04:  when you buy a new home. \nSPEAKER_04:  You get a welcome letter from Lowe's and a 10% coupon for the local Bob's discount furniture and all those things, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's some possibilities of things we could do as a city. \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't know what those are yet, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  It could be good investments for us. Just because you move in downtown doesn't mean you shouldn't know about. \nSPEAKER_04:  the uptown business district and steel craft and long beach exchange and a lot of people don't ever get outside their bubble and they use networking to figure that out of the long beach food scene site but maybe we could do a better job of marking ourselves to ourselves. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Great. And so if just to recap and also help us prepare for our next quarterly economic indicator report, I'm going to summarize some of the stats that you know been discussed. And we'd like to be included or the EDNF would like to be included. And then some others that you know we might recommend. So sales tax revenue and diving deeper specifically into other geographic areas, whether they be zip codes, neighborhoods or commercial corridors in this in this city or shopping centers, large shopping centers, for example, tax information as well. There's a reference tube. I don't think a request, but I would recommend it commercial vacancy rates that we can look at citywide. We could also look at it in specific commercial corridors in the city of Long Beach. There was a request for poverty rates. And I think related data that we should look at is per capita income and median household income. And I just want to manage expectations around how frequently some of the data is reported. So the poverty rates per capita income and median household income are reported annually. And the data is typically about two years old that we get to the American Community Survey, the U.S. Census, some of the other data. \nSPEAKER_04:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  interesting to know that that's all available on the website this committee four years ago I'm really pushed for that transparency a lot of people don't know that when you're a business people would call my office and say I really want you to put a \nSPEAKER_04:  Trader Joe's or a movie theater or at the local such and such. And so we as a city can take a step back and say, okay, well, Trader Joe's makes their business decision based on X, Y, and Z. If that's a good fit, then let's look at that. Maybe we can move this, move that, that, that, that. \nSPEAKER_04:  But a lot of those businesses, it's a considerable cost and investment to know that information about the different jurisdictions they're considering. And so our city decided to say, look, \nSPEAKER_04:  Let's buy it one time a year and put it on the website for free so that any business that wants to move to Long Beach can \nSPEAKER_04:  look at the other cities that they want to go to and then compare that data for free to us and hopefully they'll come here and I think that that's really served us pretty well. So I want to thank you for the work that you did on that. I know that was a long time ago, but it's the gift that keeps on giving. I love that place. You can dig in by zip code by \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  like voting precincts, like it's so detailed oriented, so I'd love to see a short presentation on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Wonderful. Let's go. \nSPEAKER_04: OPSmash \nSPEAKER_00:  Ayah? \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice- Chief Richard."

        "endTime": "3327",
        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Councilwoman Allen. Aye. Motion carries. Excited, please? \nSPEAKER_02:  Item 3 is a recommendation to conduct, receive and file a study session for the implementation of a racially equitable economic recovery strategy. \nSPEAKER_02:  to help long beach businesses and workers recover from. \nSPEAKER_02:  economic hardship caused by COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_03:  So Mr. Motocomension and our briefing that changes we're gonna be made to this this week. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is it? \nSPEAKER_03:  best that we take the presentation or that we wait until the changes are made. And then what I understand is President Biden made an announcement today of additional changes that were possible. \nSPEAKER_03:  around 1 o'clock? \nSPEAKER_00:  So that's not a problem. There will be, I think, a memo coming from the city managers office about changes. I'm not familiar with everything. What I can do is give you the two minute drive-through of where we're at and what is coming next. So if you just want to receive and file report real quick, and then that accommodates for these changes that are coming. \nSPEAKER_00:  I know we've got a closed session soon. \nSPEAKER_00:  So Council members, what I'll do real quick is just remind you this committee has been a leader in the economical recovery strategy. Of course, we talked about the three different phases of the economic recession relief transition and recovery. We are now in that third or shaded phase of the recovery from, you know, started in April and through the rest of this year. And we did a pond recommendation from this committee back in December, an extensive outreach legislative process. We also came back and gave a final report in March for this economic recovery strategy, which Council approved March 16th. This was a major effort by the three of you in particular, as you met with, this is over 25. It has now been over 30 community roundtables with hundreds of participants to gather these recommendations. And I think the most important was that we came away with seven guiding principles. Number one is that this is these are the targeted to the most impacted people in the most impacted areas and the most impacted sectors of the city. And so on March 16th, we got this original presentation from the city manager that laid out over $200 million worth of different programs for economic recovery, health and safe communities, and financial stability of the city itself. And specifically, in particular with economic recovery, there are about $51 million worth of programs. That range from these different areas, business development, real estate development, of course workforce development. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now, since that time, this is kind of the new information, the updates we've seen that the American Rescue Plan Act or ARPA funding was originally envisioned to be about 153 million. I've learned this week that that got cut down to about 135 million. So as part of this update, what I wanted to let you know is that even though we are now having to go back and revise some of our plans, our programs based on that new budgeted amount, we are right now in quarter three of the calendar year. That's our first phase. And we are designing programs. And in some cases, we've actually started service delivery for programs like our BizCare pop-ups, our outreach. Some of the tenant assistant programs have already rolled out for commercial and residential tenant relief. Those grants are being processed. In fact, I'm approving some of those day-to-day to this morning, in fact. You recently received TFFs, our memos on the storefront reopening and board up removal. And many other activities related to corridor cleanups, direct grants that we're doing in RFP right now for some of those services. So I wanted to give you a sense that even though we had, \nSPEAKER_00:  33 different economic support programs. They will likely roll out based on the highest need and the impacts that are happening right now. And we will over the next three quarters roll out many of these programs that were approved. This list is subject to change. And as we saw just recently, changes can come from the federal government on down. So basically, where we are right now, I wanted to give you a sense. We're doing our economic development finance committee update actually today on the 13th. We are getting our final amounts with regard to ARPA and we will revise our Long Beach Recovery Act programs this month and next month with the idea that we'll start to see these programs roll out over the next couple of months. And the business owners, nonprofits and community members will start to see some of that money rolling out in their bank accounts later this quarter and in primarily the fourth quarter of this calendar year. So I want to make sure I give this group a quarterly update as to where we are and what the community can expect. But you will get week to week memos from my department, my team approved by the city manager that detail each of the individual programs. So thank you for your time today and that's our update. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Today at 2.30, I received a communication from a community member who about two blocks from here was a victim of a violent crime. \nSPEAKER_03:  and she said that Biden's announcement today allowed for COVID funding to be used for \nSPEAKER_03:  words, put it away, right back on a plane. Put the \nSPEAKER_03:  re-staffing our police department. For those of you who don't know. \nSPEAKER_03:  our city took cuts in every department and the police department took somewhere between 10 to 15 million dollars in cuts. A lot of them were vacant positions, but previously those vacant positions funding was used as over time to fill some of those spots. And while the police department has gotten creative to make sure that we still maintain minimum staffing, we had a \nSPEAKER_03:  Retirement of 80 officers last year with an expectation of an additional 30 this year. \nSPEAKER_03:  as a person who works full time for LA County in... \nSPEAKER_03:  Our fire department we've recently discussed what. \nSPEAKER_03:  Orderings and overtime can do to the mental health of our police officers and what that means in the service and quality of care that they can provide to our residents. So I hope that with this announcement from the Biden administration that there will be serious consideration of an additional police academy in the upcoming budget. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  because when residents like this reach out to me and they were victims of violent crime. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't want there to be more victims. I don't want our individuals, our neighbors, to have to defend themselves. \nSPEAKER_03:  and our communities are seeing that impact and so I hope. \nSPEAKER_03:  that there will both be support of our communities and their public safety. \nSPEAKER_03:  and support of the mental health and fatigue. \nSPEAKER_03:  of our \nSPEAKER_03:  our heroes to provide them the resources and staffing that they need to keep us safe. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you to the Biden administration. \nSPEAKER_03:  Nice marriage. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you and thank you for the presentation. Just a couple quick things. First, I think you can just, you know, like the way you refer to this racially equitable. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's equity. It's an equitable economic recovery plan. I think it's really, really simple. I think we should... \nSPEAKER_01:  And that's how everybody is referring to, to one, the SCAG just released theirs, the inclusive economic recovery plan. And the state budget just funded it with, in the state budget, I think $45 million, it was pretty good. So I think the more we can align with all the recovery plans, the better. \nSPEAKER_01:  The second thing I would say is, I mean, we figure once we got the numbers, they would either roll or shrink and it may change again. The number may change again. But I think it, you know, we'll hear more very soon, I think, on what the numbers will be and how we handled that in the budget. I like that. \nSPEAKER_01:  I like your timeline that you have on your rollout of the recovery plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think that makes a lot of sense. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I'm interested in what the procurement, you just mentioned, hey, two, three months in advance of that phase rolling out is what the procurement will look like. I think we, if this is gonna be equitable, we need to make sure that we do the work to make sure that these communities understand the procurement process. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Also, I would love a little bit of flesh on the bone because we talked about collective impact. You got all these different funds. You show so many programs that are going to be targeted in the same neighborhoods. Right? So we got to make sure they're all, they all talk to each other the same way, right? They're different strategies, food security, digital inclusion, economic security. But what we don't want is different, spokespeople, saying speaking different rhetoric and having different outcomes. It should be really coordinated with a collective impact. I think that's important. \nSPEAKER_00:  you're all here. \nSPEAKER_00:  right there. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then there are some things that, you know, I'm just really interested in it. And I'll just continue to talk about like procurement something that we've talked about for many, many years. I want to see. \nSPEAKER_01:  I want to see how it really roll up our sleeves and get it done this time. \nSPEAKER_01:  right down payment assistance is something that we really pushed to get in. I want to I want to make sure that we we understand what our vision is how we're going to do this and we're able to shape it and roll it out. So there are some really exciting things in this plan that we want to that we want to want to be able to talk about. So this is this is very very good and to chair mongo's point I look forward to you know the city managers putting together a safety recovery plan at the request of the mayor. I fully support that request. So we look forward to what that looks like. I think it is probably going to balance some of the violence prevention work. \nSPEAKER_01:  plus some of the investments in public safety. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we want to look at what that looks like comprehensively. \nSPEAKER_01:  particularly because that will have an impact as well on the recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  We want to just keyword comprehensive collective impact. That's what we really want to look at. And those are my comments. Thanks a lot. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  two things. One, I choose not to move the motion because this was originally your motion, and the language used is actually pulled directly from your document. That's, I've been being respectful of that and quoting it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know, I think with me and John had a little talk about it. I think John put racially equitable. \nSPEAKER_03:  in your original agenda? \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, it wasn't a... \nSPEAKER_01:  the title of it on the council agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  Summer copied it from the agenda. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll fix it. Happy to do it. I was just being respectful. So please don't think I was trying to change it. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, it wasn't a slide at you. I was just saying we're being simple is better. That's all. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's our fault. We did it. It was us. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, moved in seconded. No additional queued comments. Did you have comment? Great, we'll vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Air mango. Hi. Vice chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_02:  Count to woman Ellen. Hi. Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. If there's no objection, we've run into a timeline where closed session should start. And I guess they're having some technical assistance and need for us to vacate the dius before the next round. So without objection, we'll carry over any additional items in the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  No objection? \nSPEAKER_03:  and Census and close of meeting. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, good question. Any public comment? \nSPEAKER_03:  No general public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you."
