        "transcript": "SPEAKER_00:  No, she carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Excellent. Next item, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Item 2 is a recommendation to receive and file a report on 2nd quarter 2021 economic indicators and sales tax study report for the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  Excellent, I believe we have a staff report. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, Chair of the Economic Development Finance Committee and members of the Economic Development Finance Committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm Eric Romero, the business development officer in the Economic Development Department, and we'll be presenting to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  some self-tax indicators today. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this is our second presentation this year on economic indicators last time we presented to you with \nSPEAKER_01:  July of 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so I'll start by presenting to you the latest quarterly sales tax revenue comparisons. \nSPEAKER_01:  Across multiple geographic areas, this includes a recently released \nSPEAKER_01:  Q2 2021 data. \nSPEAKER_01:  As requested in the last economic development and finance committee meeting, I will also present annual sales tax revenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  at \nSPEAKER_01:  by major industry groups and this will be year over year data 2019 versus 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will also present annual sales tax revenue by business improvement district area. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are also happy to take your request for additional commercial areas that you would like us to present on in the future, but we'll start with the big areas. \nSPEAKER_01:  As requested, I will also share information about the confidentiality requirements as it pertains to local self-tax records. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that's how we'll wrap up this presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  And as you know, the committee may also request additional economic indicators that we can present on in the future. \nSPEAKER_01:  and I'll wrap up with a presentation on some suggestions for you to consider. \nSPEAKER_01:  The chart that you see on the slide here is a display per capita self-tax revenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  across multiple geographic areas, specifically compares Long Beach to Los Angeles County. \nSPEAKER_01:  the Southern California region and the state of California. \nSPEAKER_01:  as you can see. \nSPEAKER_01:  Long Beach continues to underperform and compare to all three geographic areas. \nSPEAKER_01:  But all areas have seen gains in per capita sales tax revenue from the first quarter of 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the second quarter of 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  which is a positive sign. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Q2 2021 data for Long Beach almost mirrors. \nSPEAKER_01:  the 2Q 2019 data, which is pre-pandemic times. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it beats a 2Q 2018 data. So this is positive news for the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  The next I will share the sales tax data by major industry groups as they are categorized by HDL or sales tax consultant. \nSPEAKER_01:  And before I do that, I wanted to share some examples of the types of businesses that are included in each category. \nSPEAKER_01:  We will cover seven categories today. This does not include the state and county pools information. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we had covered in our last presentation to the EDNF. \nSPEAKER_01:  And you can see them here on the screen. You also have them in front of you. How does the presentation? \nSPEAKER_01:  that you can review to get a better idea of the types of businesses that are included in each of the major industry groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  So again, per for your request at the last EDNF meeting, this chart displays year over year sales tax revenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  by major industry groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  It offers a 2019. \nSPEAKER_01:  versus 2020 comparison, and these are calendar years. \nSPEAKER_01:  and shows the impacts of the pandemic from a sales tax revenue standpoint. \nSPEAKER_01:  on different industry groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  You can see that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Autos and transportation, which is car sales and leases primarily. \nSPEAKER_01:  decreased by 6%. \nSPEAKER_01:  building and construction industry. \nSPEAKER_01:  group decreased by 16%. \nSPEAKER_01:  Business and industry, the largest industry group of all of the major industry groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  decreased by 5%. \nSPEAKER_01:  Food and drugs industry group increased by 17%. \nSPEAKER_01:  And as we stated during the last report to the eating of the city did \nSPEAKER_01:  report stronger cannabis tax and fee revenue in 2020 that contributed to the increase. \nSPEAKER_01:  and FY20 Cannabis Tax and Free Revenues outperformed budget estimates by $6.3 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  It came in at about 2.10.3 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  which was, and 4 million was originally budgeted. \nSPEAKER_01:  and fuel and service stations decreased by 34%. I think it's safe to say that. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is less driving due to the pandemic and stay at home orders as people were telecommuting. \nSPEAKER_01:  and schools require. \nSPEAKER_01:  And finally, general consumer goods decreased by 15%. \nSPEAKER_01:  actually and that the last one is restaurants and hotels. \nSPEAKER_01:  which increased by 30%, which is significant. \nSPEAKER_01:  and was this industry was severely impacted by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Emerald. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, we typically let you do your whole presentation, since there's only two of us at the Dias today. Would you be open to taking questions along the way? \nSPEAKER_01:  I'd love to go through the lot of the next slide, and then we could pause there before I jump into the bit areas of that, okay? Right. \nSPEAKER_03:  Ennemy Shaw. \nSPEAKER_01:  Perfect. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this table here compares Q2 2020 data and Q2 2021 data across the major industry groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Q2 2020 data captures data from really the thick of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  April 2020 through June 2020, of course, we're still in a pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  and local and state emergency health orders were only put in place in March 2020 as you know. \nSPEAKER_01:  The news is that the comparison shows strong gains for most categories, with only a decrease reported in building and construction. \nSPEAKER_01:  Of course, this needs further study. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I think it's safe to say that some of the decreases in building construction could be related to \nSPEAKER_01:  the supply chain issues that we've been hearing about in the news and that we're aware of. \nSPEAKER_01:  and increase in cost for materials, so think steel wood and other important materials. \nSPEAKER_01:  for this industry group. \nSPEAKER_01:  The oil and service stations reported an 88% increase, likely due to more people returning to work. \nSPEAKER_01:  kids returning to school and lots of driving happening as a result. \nSPEAKER_01:  I know that my fuel cost have certainly gone up over the past year in particular. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's a few months in particular. \nSPEAKER_01:  Restaurants and hotels reported an 84% increase, which is a really strong increase. \nSPEAKER_01:  General Consumer Goods reported a 71% increase. And again, these are all positive signs for our economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we will continue to monitor that as the news. \nSPEAKER_01:  Q3 2021 data is released. \nSPEAKER_01:  And of course, as the Q4 data is released as well. So I can pause there before we jump into \nSPEAKER_01:  the bid areas and happy to answer any questions and whatever we can't answer we'll circle back with those answers. \nSPEAKER_03:  Wonderful. So I think it's interesting. \nSPEAKER_03:  In 2019, we started out with a \nSPEAKER_03:  Standard Q1. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then the pandemic hit. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so when you look at 2019 data compared to 2020 data, \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_03:  on 5-5. \nSPEAKER_03:  There are categories where I would be surprised that 2020 is lower. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, um. \nSPEAKER_03:  In 2019, \nSPEAKER_03:  You pretty much had a complete halt on... \nSPEAKER_03:  leaving your home almost right but you had fuel stations still at almost 9 million verses \nSPEAKER_03:  the 2020 number being closer to six. That was surprising to me. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I also understand the supply chain issues within construction and maintenance. \nSPEAKER_03:  But within that, we also saw significant price increases. \nSPEAKER_03:  So if you used to buy a thing of plywood for $9, it was $36. They had a 300% increase in cost. \nSPEAKER_03:  which theoretically \nSPEAKER_03:  if you didn't have a one-third sale of an amount of quantity. \nSPEAKER_03:  you make that variant. \nSPEAKER_03:  So those are a little bit confusing to me. \nSPEAKER_03:  But specifically when we look at the restaurants and hotels \nSPEAKER_03:  the 11.3 million down to 7.9 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  My question would be how many are we talking about? \nSPEAKER_03:  And I'm interested in knowing how many restaurants we lost during the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I know that like giving an aggregate total \nSPEAKER_03:  There might be some value in finding out, okay, the 2019 number includes X number of restaurants. \nSPEAKER_03:  and the average restaurant. \nSPEAKER_03:  Gross receipts was why. \nSPEAKER_03:  In 2020, it was why a number of restaurants and the gross receipts was the \nSPEAKER_03:  because there are less restaurants. I'm curious if \nSPEAKER_03:  There's a shift in the total quantity of sales to those remaining restaurants. \nSPEAKER_03:  or if there's been an overall decrease over time. And I know that's a... \nSPEAKER_03:  get back to us kind of answer. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  But yeah, with the demand for construction. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm also curious to know if the construction decrease \nSPEAKER_03:  is happening in all the categories. \nSPEAKER_03:  So when you go back to size 4, \nSPEAKER_03:  We've talked about this and I know this was a little bit before your time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_03:  but I'm sorry it's like two. Like two. \nSPEAKER_03:  On a per capita basis, Long Beach residents have always been \nSPEAKER_03:  Rugal. \nSPEAKER_03:  compared to the state average and compared to the county average. \nSPEAKER_03:  But what I do notice in 21Q1. \nSPEAKER_03:  is that the lines are getting closer together. So we're left then. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  $400 tick mark apart. \nSPEAKER_03:  versus if you go back to Q4 of 18. \nSPEAKER_03:  We were nearly two tick marks apart from the Los Angeles County number. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we're gaining on that. I think that... \nSPEAKER_03:  some of the things we've discussed also were \nSPEAKER_03:  the growth of wealth. \nSPEAKER_03:  in a city and an area where \nSPEAKER_03:  A large \nSPEAKER_03:  component of our population are \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Solid. \nSPEAKER_03:  supported. \nSPEAKER_03:  Union jobs in the medical industry and the construction industry and the \nSPEAKER_03:  education industry in those industries that really survived in the pro-really. \nSPEAKER_03:  worked through the pandemic while not. \nSPEAKER_03:  be able to spend their money at restaurants and travel and those things. So \nSPEAKER_03:  Those are just some of the comments that I have on the first part. I think this is excellent data. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilor Allen, do you have any questions at the side? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yup. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's continue. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Great, thank you for the comments and the questions. And yes, we will take all the notes for the questions that we can't answer today, and we'll work closely. \nSPEAKER_01:  with our research partners to make sure that we circle back with that information. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm going to transition now to slide seven. \nSPEAKER_01:  so that we can look at some of the sales tax revenue by business improvement district areas. \nSPEAKER_01:  And again, displaying data by geo areas was a request at the last EDNF meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to start with the big areas and can present on other areas at the future. So if you have any recommendations on specific commercial areas, \nSPEAKER_01:  or shopping centers that you'd like us to consider. We're happy to consider that and ultimately gather the information and make it available to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  This table is meant to provide a visual of where the different be it areas stand, it's a busy slide, I know that. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we will dive deeper into these areas in the subsequent slides. \nSPEAKER_01:  This table does not include the downtown bid because it is an outlier when compared to the other bid areas. It just generates a lot more revenue compared to the rest that are here on this table. \nSPEAKER_01:  or this chart. \nSPEAKER_01:  It also does not include the Long Beach Tourism, Business Improvement Area because it is not a traditional retail centric bid. It's a very different type of bid. \nSPEAKER_01:  You can see here that Bixby Noles is the top performer compared to the rest of the bids in this chart. \nSPEAKER_01:  Belmachor comes in second and Zafaryyad does come in third. \nSPEAKER_01:  Magnolia comes forth followed by the uptown P-bit in fifth. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then Midtown and Fort Street come at the bottom. \nSPEAKER_01:  averaging the low $200,000 in sales tax revenue per year. \nSPEAKER_01:  It is important to note that the sales tax revenue generated \nSPEAKER_01:  Per area varies depending on the size of the bed, the commercial vacancies in the area. \nSPEAKER_01:  the foot traffic and other factors as well and the big spin-all business improvement district is a lot bigger than some of the other bids that are listed here on this chart. \nSPEAKER_01:  This next chart here shows the top three performing bids that were displayed in the last chart. \nSPEAKER_01:  Each of the bids, as you can see, was impacted by their pandemic. \nSPEAKER_01:  In terms of sales tax revenue generated, XpNOLs lost about 12% from 2019 to 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  Zafaria lost 9% from 2019 to 2020 and Belmont Shore lost 26% \nSPEAKER_01:  from 2019 to 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  Magnolia Industrial Group PBID lost only 1% of revenue from 2019 to 2020, so not a big loss there. \nSPEAKER_01:  The uptown P bid was the only bid that reported an increase from 2019 to 2020. The increase was less than 1%. \nSPEAKER_01:  but still good news for that big area. \nSPEAKER_01:  at the Fort Street. \nSPEAKER_01:  area reported the loss of about 7% from 2019 to 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  and Midtown reported a loss of 3% from 2019 to 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now we'll look at the downtown bid. \nSPEAKER_01:  And this is inclusive of both the property-based improvement district and the parking of business improvement area, which is a merchant-based improvement district. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the boundaries that we use were for the merchant base and they include both bids, essentially. \nSPEAKER_01:  So again, \nSPEAKER_01:  We wanted to present this one on its own due to the size of revenue that it brings in compared to the other bids. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we saw a pretty significant decrease for the downtown bid. \nSPEAKER_01:  It reported a 30% decrease from 2019 to 2020 prior to that. It was climbing. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm performing stronger than it had in other years. \nSPEAKER_01:  And this is of course the largest decline of any of the bids. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we saw from 2019 to 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it's important to note as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So when we look at this final slide on \nSPEAKER_01:  self-tax revenue by bid area. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can see that the table and the chart \nSPEAKER_01:  both on this slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  Compare calendar year 2020 and calendar year 2021 year-to-date sales tax revenue by bid \nSPEAKER_01:  And as you can see, most bid areas are reporting 2021 year-to-date revenues that are already over 50% of the revenue collected in 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is a good sign and shows that cells are stronger in 2021 compared to 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  Both Downtown and Belmont Shore reported the largest losses in revenue in 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's good to see them bounce back in terms of sales tax revenue in 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  Downtown's 21 year-to-date sales tax revenues already 66%. \nSPEAKER_01:  of as a percentage of 2020 revenue. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this includes the first two quarters in 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  the month's our January through June 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the only one that is less than 50% right now is the Magnoline Industrial Group P-Bid. \nSPEAKER_03:  Excellent. So with relation to the business improvement districts and your first question, which is, \nSPEAKER_03:  related to page seven are there others that we would like to include it in the future? \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think the Long Beach Town Center. \nSPEAKER_03:  is one \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that when you do a multi year, you'll see a similar adjustment. \nSPEAKER_03:  when you lose a big retailer and then you gain a replacement retailer, what does that look like? And you can see those changes. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that's going to be pretty um \nSPEAKER_03:  obvious for the uptown bid. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that in each of these parentheses to say how many businesses we're talking about would make a big difference. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that when you're comparing Belmont Shore \nSPEAKER_00:  I think that's it. \nSPEAKER_03:  to say. \nSPEAKER_03:  Midtown. \nSPEAKER_03:  the number of businesses and the sheer variance. And then I think that noting \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  a lot of shuttered doors on second street. So let's say, for instance, they used to have \nSPEAKER_03:  96 businesses, now they drop down to 86 businesses. \nSPEAKER_03:  You'd then be able to really see, okay, well, they didn't lose as big of a percentage of revenue as they lost. \nSPEAKER_03:  percentage of doors. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so just for us to look at that timeline for a bounce back. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  And then the second one I would include would be Long Beach Exchange plus plus. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I would do Long Beach Exchange and the business area adjacent, which is Northway. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that then you have the data from Norris Way, from Pre-Lonage Exchange. \nSPEAKER_03:  and you'd also be able to see as long as you exchange flourish. \nSPEAKER_03:  and grew what does that look like and then you can see when it loses a business or you can see those fluctuations over time. \nSPEAKER_03:  as they grow. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you have any other bids or business areas you'd like to include? \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then, um, \nSPEAKER_03:  This is really great data. \nSPEAKER_03:  What do we think that the downturn from 2014 to 2015 in the downtown bid was? \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't remember anything specific when I first got elected. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a pretty significant drop on site 10. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I, that's a great question. I am not aware at this time. What could have influenced the downturn from 2014 to 2015? \nSPEAKER_01:  However, we're happy to look into it with our self-tax consultant and we'll also \nSPEAKER_01:  As you've mentioned, look at the number of active licenses as well in the area. \nSPEAKER_03:  And maybe just call them. They probably know better than most. \nSPEAKER_03:  on site 11 is the year to date through June 30th? Is that all these reports are through June 30th? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, the year to date, 2021 year to date. So we have the Q2 2021 data. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that that is going to be just... \nSPEAKER_03:  great recovery when we talk with the city manager about \nSPEAKER_03:  where we see ourselves your end with sales tax. I think this is a really inspiring opportunity. \nSPEAKER_03:  This not only speaks well to the general fund, but also speaks well towards measure A funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what will have available come your end. So, \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  This is excellent. I always appreciate you ending with 512. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I'd 13, which are the legal requirements. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_03:  and some of the data related. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  And thank you for your recommendations also in the different commercial areas that we should include and provide at the next update. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll circle back with each of the ED and F committee members to get additional commercial areas that may be \nSPEAKER_01:  North Long Beach or second district and of course across the entire city. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we do have some of those that data ready to go. We just wanted to make sure that we got your input before we start representing it here. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I guess I would ask you once I see the numbers of like number of businesses like \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know how many businesses are in the midtown peabit. \nSPEAKER_03:  But if it's safe. \nSPEAKER_03:  30 \nSPEAKER_03:  Then Spring Street would be a comparable, right? Because Spring Street has more than 30, and I would say, okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  on Spring Street from \nSPEAKER_03:  bellflower to Studebaker. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just on that corridor. \nSPEAKER_03:  that would be bigger than some of these peabins. \nSPEAKER_03:  But again \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know what I'm comparing it to because I just don't know the scope even in a worse way. \nSPEAKER_03:  I see Norseway, I see it through the eyes of myself as a child when I was riding my bike to Jack the Box. \nSPEAKER_03:  to get. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh, \nSPEAKER_03:  Oreo cookie shake and then go across the street to the liquor store and grab some gobstoppers, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  But when I sat there in my first business meeting, I'm like, \nSPEAKER_03:  Wow, there's a lot of businesses on the street and as a kid you don't see it's two stories and there's businesses upstairs and they have a whole different \nSPEAKER_00:  Wow! \nSPEAKER_03:  dynamic and so maybe if you were even able to see on a map. \nSPEAKER_03:  um, through GIS, like \nSPEAKER_03:  Where are the clusters of businesses that we probably should be tracking? \nSPEAKER_03:  especially the ones that have high vacancy. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I don't know what those look like right now. \nSPEAKER_03:  because I don't. \nSPEAKER_03:  Citywide. \nSPEAKER_03:  that comparison, but once you're able to say, okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  The smallest PBIT has X businesses. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're any major clusters that have that many. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't even want to say businesses because if it's a vacant spot available for lease. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  You'd want to even consider that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was in a regional meeting related to Ezri. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Ezri was talking about how they can pull down. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a different data point. \nSPEAKER_03:  or fire departments related to. \nSPEAKER_03:  business licenses, assessor data, and how that all divides out for you to be able to say there could be. \nSPEAKER_03:  200 businesses a year. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  You are currently... \nSPEAKER_03:  65. \nSPEAKER_03:  Now does that mean that \nSPEAKER_03:  There aren't businesses that or that there are and they're not licensed or all of that's a whole other discussion for a lot of other departments to get involved in. \nSPEAKER_03:  but from a public safety standpoint knowing that. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  and then using that data for ourselves to help push up the 3D to the next level. \nSPEAKER_03:  is pretty dynamic. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great work. Great presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  And these are the exact ones. \nSPEAKER_01:  Exactly back that we do have data that we can present to you on the number of active businesses. We actually have a great \nSPEAKER_01:  a map called Ismap that's enabled by Ezri. That's on the city's website right now that we can look at all the active licenses. \nSPEAKER_01:  Also do have access to commercial vacancy information. \nSPEAKER_01:  And as we look at the HDL sales tax revenue, we know the count of the businesses that are included. \nSPEAKER_01:  that's ultimately come up with the numbers that you're seeing in front of you today. So we're happy to get that information and present it back to you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Awesome. \nSPEAKER_02:  And also I have a quick question for you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is it easy for you to include in this report? \nSPEAKER_02:  the number of businesses that are located in each peabit. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, so we can provide that information. Awesome. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think it should be like standing on the report. It should be like four-street pivot parentheses, number of businesses. \nSPEAKER_03:  And when it changes, we should know that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, yeah, we're happy to provide that information. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I am so excited for your in numbers to see what this looks like. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  For those of you who don't know, June 30th for our fiscal year is 3-quarters of data. \nSPEAKER_03:  even though there's a \nSPEAKER_03:  quarter in the previous year that wasn't so. \nSPEAKER_03:  Beautiful. Um, hopefully. \nSPEAKER_03:  The port will unload all those trucks. \nSPEAKER_03:  in time for the holidays and there will be spending. \nSPEAKER_03:  in a way that will both \nSPEAKER_03:  improve our sales tax numbers but also provide the goods and services that our community needs in a meaningful way. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, um, \nSPEAKER_03:  I appreciate that the last time we saw this report, we did the county pool. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I understand the county pool is performing better than we expected as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so my thought would be \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_03:  Our next report would probably be a version of both of those combined. \nSPEAKER_03:  We don't need to do it at a separate meeting. Would that be okay with you? Come from an Allen. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Great. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great report. \nSPEAKER_01:  All just end because this was a request of the committee the last time that we presented to you all \nSPEAKER_01:  I have to just cover some of the confidentiality requirements. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we'll just go through this quickly, but basically for self-tax payments for groups of businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  They can be revealed to the general public if they meet two rules that are called the gang of four and eighty percent rules that need to be followed. \nSPEAKER_01:  Basically, \nSPEAKER_01:  When the data can be combined for four or more businesses to be released. \nSPEAKER_01:  As long as no one member, no one business is the source of basically 80% \nSPEAKER_01:  or more of the total sales tax revenue for all four businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  And it is also possible to publish a list of top cell text generators. \nSPEAKER_01:  as long as that. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have to include at least 25 of those retailers. \nSPEAKER_01:  businesses have to be presented in a random or alphabetical order. \nSPEAKER_01:  They can't be ranked by the amount that they paid, the self-sex revenue that they generated. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the the amounts that they generated have to be limited as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then with regard to the authorization to review, confidential sales and use tax information, \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a city resolution that authorizes the city manager to designate to the state board of equalization. \nSPEAKER_01:  basically officers and employees that have authority to examine these records. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this includes the city assistant city manager, city auditor staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  certain economic development staff most \nSPEAKER_01:  Basically, our management team across the different bureaus. \nSPEAKER_01:  certain financial management staff and the chair of the Economic Development and Finance Committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the sales and use tax records may be examined for the following purposes. So tracking key performance indicators like we're doing today and other economic development purposes. \nSPEAKER_01:  forecasting and budget related functions and to detect any misallocations or deficiencies. \nSPEAKER_03:  So page 13 for those of you who don't remember was a \nSPEAKER_03:  Be very careful.\" \nSPEAKER_03:  discussion under a previous city manager that actually came with a lot of consternation. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the reason that I felt so passionately that \nSPEAKER_03:  members of this committee or at least the chair and I thought it was the whole committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  individually but not in a group could but it looked like maybe it was just the chair. \nSPEAKER_03:  would have access to that. \nSPEAKER_03:  not that I've drawn it down recently, but we did do a couple of questions specifically on \nSPEAKER_03:  I have it. \nSPEAKER_03:  misallocation and deficiencies. \nSPEAKER_03:  And oftentimes elected officials are really in tune to what is going on. \nSPEAKER_03:  at least in their district. \nSPEAKER_03:  and um \nSPEAKER_03:  when we are held responsible for the city's fiscal \nSPEAKER_03:  fullness. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we don't have the ability to audit the numbers that come in or review them and provide any additional guidance to help us. \nSPEAKER_03:  Increase. \nSPEAKER_03:  revenues in those areas and to know and understand. \nSPEAKER_03:  what kind of information we should be providing to our colleagues on how we can assist. \nSPEAKER_03:  and improving. \nSPEAKER_03:  our partnership with brokers and \nSPEAKER_03:  attending \nSPEAKER_03:  conferences where we recruit \nSPEAKER_03:  businesses to our city without knowing and understanding the variance. \nSPEAKER_03:  and value of \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll give you an example. Wamych Town Center as a whole. \nSPEAKER_03:  Long Beach Town Center is a whole lost of vendor. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that vendor and we've lost many during my time here. \nSPEAKER_03:  generated 6 million a year in gross receipts. \nSPEAKER_03:  And there was a lot of consternation, but \nSPEAKER_03:  Knowing that I knew, I wasn't able to say specifically. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, that vendor only brought in this and we're bringing in an event that replaces it with 40 million a year in grocery seats. \nSPEAKER_03:  So even if you had vacancy for six months, the city's still gonna be better off. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the reason that it would probably produce more is because it's a product that the community demands. \nSPEAKER_03:  and their strategy on how far apart they put stores and who their competitors are and all of those things. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm just giving that kind of education to your elected officials is \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe just so powerful and I think it's a big step of why. \nSPEAKER_03:  this council, at least what I've seen with the exception of downtown since 2014. \nSPEAKER_03:  has really lifted sales tax revenue in a way that other cities have not. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so for those reasons, I really appreciate the support of my colleagues at that time. I feel like \nSPEAKER_03:  The senior guy on the council who really fought for this was Pat Tricodonald and he really stood up and said why it was important and the deficiencies having not had it and having served on budget committee for many years. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm really stuck with with everyone and \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  I look forward to making sure that I'm. \nSPEAKER_03:  considerations considering why hesitate to lock the store curtain. \nSPEAKER_03:  I try to meet with our economic development \nSPEAKER_03:  Department had regularly to make sure that I'm in the know and understanding. \nSPEAKER_03:  what we as a council can do to really lift the city up. \nSPEAKER_03:  in a meaningful way. And it... \nSPEAKER_03:  It's a lot of extra work that nobody sees because it is confidential. \nSPEAKER_03:  but I just think it's so powerful. \nSPEAKER_03:  in sharing that information in the aggregate, but knowing it in the detail to be able to be effective. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have a motion and can I go a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I see no public comments. \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's cast boats. \nSPEAKER_03: \u304a\u3057\u307e\u3044"

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  next time please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Item 3 is a recommendation to conduct, receive, and file a study session. \nSPEAKER_02:  and receive input. \nSPEAKER_02:  for the implementation of the Long Beach Recovery Act as approved by Council on March 16, 2021. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think we're done. \nSPEAKER_04:  staff report. We're changing out seats. \nSPEAKER_00:  Members of the City Council, thank you so much. What we actually are going to do today is catch you up on the economic recovery strategy. \nSPEAKER_00:  This is our quarterly report on \nSPEAKER_00:  the \nSPEAKER_00:  strategy for recovering after COVID-19 and the economic recession that was caused. \nSPEAKER_00:  by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_00:  This committee has taken a leadership role as you remember. \nSPEAKER_00:  presenting to the City Council a very robust package. \nSPEAKER_00:  of recommendations based on significant community outreach, roundtables, meeting with industry experts, which many of you actually personally attended throughout the pandemic so that we would be ready when the \nSPEAKER_00:  pandemic subsided and if there were a federal stimulus \nSPEAKER_00:  And so on March 16th, the City Council approved. \nSPEAKER_00:  a large package of recovery strategies recommended by this committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  and funded by initially the CARES Act. \nSPEAKER_00:  The American Rescue Plan Act was something that Congress passed in the spring and took a few months for it to make its way out into cities and states. But ultimately, as part of the fiscal year 22 budget approved, \nSPEAKER_00:  just last month. \nSPEAKER_00:  on the City Council appropriated. \nSPEAKER_00:  A significant amount, you can see a grand total. This is actually an image of the \nSPEAKER_00:  summary from the budget office of $226 million across \nSPEAKER_00:  a number of American rescue plan actors. \nSPEAKER_00:  programs? \nSPEAKER_00:  including some 29.5 roughly million dollars for economic support programs that were identified by this committee in the Economic Recovery Plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as of October 1st, the New Fiscal Year, these resources, which include the dollars that will be talking about in just a few minutes, but also the dollars that were appropriated to other departments like Airport, obviously for transportation and for COVID protection for businesses. All of those dollars together for economic recovery totaled about $64 million. \nSPEAKER_00:  and specifically \nSPEAKER_00:  programs that were identified in the economic recovery strategy. \nSPEAKER_00:  were 33 individual programs in about $30 million as I mentioned that we presented to the council as part of the budget process. These include direct grants, the economic inclusion programs, other programs that help with technical assistance and clean streets as well as testing and tracing support to businesses and all delivered through a collective impact model which means \nSPEAKER_00:  working with many different departments. \nSPEAKER_00:  nonprofits and private sector partners to deliver these programs. \nSPEAKER_00:  So what I'd like to do today actually is give you an update as to what \nSPEAKER_00:  comes next with a new fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_00:  And to do that, I wanted to \nSPEAKER_00:  first \nSPEAKER_00:  just give you a sense that all of the programs that were recommended by community members and round tables that we all Participated in they are here and these extensive spread sheets these these matrices that I'm projecting are not meant to \nSPEAKER_00:  for you to read through. These are the programs that were part of the budget package. And I just wanted the community to see how robust this economic support package was that you all recommended and then adopted with the City Council. \nSPEAKER_00:  And secondly, what I wanted to do is introduce you to Meredith Reynolds, our deputy city manager who we are now working with as an economic development department. \nSPEAKER_00:  to implement the Long Beach Recovery Act programs. \nSPEAKER_00:  because over the past couple of months \nSPEAKER_00:  with all of the federal regulations, the city administration of all these funds. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  We rely on Meredith and her team. \nSPEAKER_00:  to ensure that we are structuring these programs appropriately and consistent with the federal bill as well as ensuring that all of the recommendations that the community put forth about making sure we had streamlined application processes that we made \nSPEAKER_00:  the funding accessible to all parts of the area. I remember the recommendations about ensuring equity. \nSPEAKER_00:  that those are included in the program design. So I'm going to actually turn it over to Meredith to introduce herself and this effort and give the committee some updates about what kinds of communications we can expect with regard to Long Beach Recovery Act. Meredith? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks, John. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, members of the committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for having me. I'm Meredith Reynolds, Special Deputy City Manager for Recovery. I'm joined today by one of my staff, Monique Cousault. \nSPEAKER_01:  who are the administrative analysts. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm happy to be here and talk a little bit about kind of where we're headed, where we've been, where we're headed and answer any questions that you might have. \nSPEAKER_01:  We started this effort after City Council adopted the Law Beach Recovery Act and so we've been spending the last several months. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  really getting to know the interim rule, which is the federal guidelines that are associated with the ARPA funds. \nSPEAKER_01:  and also receiving additional funding for a total of 249.3 million. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we're really excited about that. It's quite a large amount of money. \nSPEAKER_01:  in many cases surpasses the budgets of some small cities in California. \nSPEAKER_01:  going to be a considerable \nSPEAKER_01:  administrative and staff effort to ensure that we're properly spending the funds in accordance with the Summer of the Federal Guidelines in addition to Council of Holocies and Priorities. \nSPEAKER_01:  So over the last few months we've been getting ourselves organized and establishing some working teams that are going through \nSPEAKER_01:  all of these guidelines and creating a process for reviewing and approving the programs that were adopted by Council and the implementation plans associated with them. As part of that process, we are looking at not just ensuring we're \nSPEAKER_01:  proving the programs as you see listed here on your screen. \nSPEAKER_01:  but looking to ensure that they are meeting all of our equity goals. \nSPEAKER_01:  all of our collective impact goals, using the feedback from the community listening sessions to inform \nSPEAKER_01:  both program design and the processes by which the programs will be implemented. \nSPEAKER_01:  along with a variety of other financial compliance items. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those program implementation plans are submitted to a variety of departments. \nSPEAKER_01:  who are partnering, in this case, if economic development is submitting a program implementation plan, those have been \nSPEAKER_01:  collaborated on with folks like Library, Parks, and Rec, Technology, and Innovation, and a variety of others to make those ideas better and the programs better. Ultimately, those program implementation plans get approved by the City Manager's Office before they get implemented. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  As a part of all of this, the other thing we've been working on is what our reporting and data collection schedule will be. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we are working on our first initial Long Beach Recovery Act report. That is anticipated to be produced as a two-front-form memo that will be provided every six months. And that will provide all of the data associated with the 83-plus programs associated with the Long Beach Recovery Act that Council did adopt. \nSPEAKER_01:  So all of that information is forthcoming in a two-from-form memo, two-city council and likely a future council presentation or a series of council presentations. \nSPEAKER_01:  as this money is available and will need to be spent by December of 2024. \nSPEAKER_01:  Finally, I just wanted to call your attention. \nSPEAKER_01:  to our recovery website. That's the other thing we've been working on. It's sort of in its initial stage at the moment, but we'll get far more robust as these programs get rolled out. \nSPEAKER_01:  But Long Beach dot gov slash recovery is where you can find all information related to recovery for the city of Long Beach And that is available as for the public today \nSPEAKER_01:  That concludes my introduction, but I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for the presentation. I imagine understanding all the federal guidelines took a good portion of your day, but I do appreciate your robust presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  When we close the fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_04:  or \nSPEAKER_04:  Just close the fiscal year I got. \nSPEAKER_04:  Will we be receiving a report that demonstrates how much funding from each of these categories has been spent to date? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm getting you needed to provide that to F&D. \nSPEAKER_01:  We do. \nSPEAKER_01:  And yes, our first report. \nSPEAKER_01:  that was due to Treasury was related to the funding provision we plan to submit all of our future reports under. So that was due on October 31st and is available on our website. But those future detailed reports will be forthcoming. \nSPEAKER_04:  So do you perceive that this? \nSPEAKER_04:  document would have. \nSPEAKER_04:  an additional column that shows. \nSPEAKER_04:  fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_04:  21 \nSPEAKER_04:  expenditures. So like, let's say, \nSPEAKER_04:  direct grants to restaurants breweries and bars, $4 million. \nSPEAKER_04:  You'd be able to have a call on the theoretically that says. \nSPEAKER_04:  This is your 21 expenditures of 2.3 million. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we would know what's been spent. \nSPEAKER_04:  and what's still remaining to be spent in the upcoming fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, or are you doing? \nSPEAKER_04:  or are you doing it by federal year? \nSPEAKER_01:  We are doing it by fiscal year. We'll also have to do it by federal year. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. That earlier will probably roll up differently because of their reporting requirements, but we will absolutely provide that information transparently to the council and to the public. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  there? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  The other element of this will be a lot of the data will be available on the city dashboard that you can you know review \nSPEAKER_01:  and toggle things on and off as you would like to see them. So we're working with Technology and Innovation to establish that as part of the website so that will be available at that recovery website as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So you can look at it by fiscal year. You can look at it the data by \nSPEAKER_01:  funding that is spent versus funding that remains and things of that nature. So that'll be part of the overall plan as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  So our next meeting is in. \nSPEAKER_04:  early January. \nSPEAKER_04:  So what would be helpful is \nSPEAKER_04:  It's great that reports just get published to the website. \nSPEAKER_04:  but for \nSPEAKER_04:  Council members to have a same point in time reference to discuss and \nSPEAKER_04:  strategize and know how to... \nSPEAKER_04:  support the staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the community that we serve. \nSPEAKER_04:  What would be helpful is if at our next meeting there were was an agenda item that included \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  Long Beach Recovery Act, year end closing, fiscal 21. \nSPEAKER_04:  They kind of just went through where that is. \nSPEAKER_04:  and highlighted any major areas where we're either significantly behind. \nSPEAKER_04:  or ahead of schedule in \nSPEAKER_04:  providing that support. I know that \nSPEAKER_04:  Both Pumple and Allen and I were very supportive of getting as much money. \nSPEAKER_04:  into the hands of the grantees as soon as possible. \nSPEAKER_04:  But I know that there's a big feedback loop on the challenges that some of them \nSPEAKER_04:  have. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh in \nSPEAKER_04:  appropriately extending that funding and potentially giving back funding and other issues that may come up and I think we'd like to be \nSPEAKER_04:  a prize of that on as we go basis instead of being at the end of the grant and not really aware. \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't necessarily think this needs to be part of the quarterly report, but maybe twice a year would be great. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm just... \nSPEAKER_04:  for us to have a point in time. And then when you do provide those updates to the website, \nSPEAKER_04:  I can't imagine that you want to aggregate all that data for a memo to ask, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  even just an email stating. \nSPEAKER_04:  to the committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  A significant amount of information on the website has been updated. Click here to see ABC&D. \nSPEAKER_04:  that have recently been updated because there's a lot on that site. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I'm sure you can get lost. \nSPEAKER_04:  if they're not really sure what they're looking for. \nSPEAKER_04:  but I think having a lot of data is great for our transparent team. We appreciate you for doing that. \nSPEAKER_04:  No additional comment and I see no public comment. We'll go ahead and cast our vote."

This should be about a five minute report, but it's extremely exciting. As you know, the City of Long Beach Economic Development Commission, which is 11 members appointed by the mayor and approved by Council, are an incredible group of people, regular citizens who are leaders in their industries and in their occupations. \nSPEAKER_01:  and they meet monthly really to provide guidance. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the staff of the Economic Development Department as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  as the City Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  through \nSPEAKER_01:  strategic planning efforts. \nSPEAKER_01:  and our deputy city attorney. \nSPEAKER_01:  Join us yesterday Monica Kaleito for \nSPEAKER_01:  our study session with the Economic Development Commission. It's always a robust discussion about what's happening in the world and the economy, and ultimately what do we need to do as a city? \nSPEAKER_01:  to make this a more equitable economy for workers, investors, entrepreneurs. \nSPEAKER_01:  and grow the overall. \nSPEAKER_01:  a regional product of the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  So real quick, I wanted to give you a background on the blue print because we are in the middle. \nSPEAKER_01:  of a blueprint update. \nSPEAKER_01:  for 2030. \nSPEAKER_01:  and um \nSPEAKER_01:  The blue print was originally directed to the Commission by the Marin City Council back in 2015. \nSPEAKER_01:  And the goal was really to coordinate our economic activity and to develop a strategy across all city departments and sectors to foster investment in development in the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  The 2016 was our busy, busy year where we did extensive community outreach with 26 different study sessions with industry experts and panels. We did a huge economic trends report. \nSPEAKER_01:  through beacon economics. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we used that at the foundation for the first blueprint, which really was projecting \nSPEAKER_01:  the opportunities for growth. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the Long Beach economy. In 2017 April 4th to be exact \nSPEAKER_01:  D \nSPEAKER_01:  Council adopted the first blueprint for economic development and it believe it or not this April will be the five-year anniversary So we'll have a big huge party, but our goal is to actually have for you the city council the blueprint 2.0 ready to go for adoption by April of 2022 so We have a lot of work to do, but a little bit about the blueprint \nSPEAKER_00:  Oh, it's... \nSPEAKER_01:  This mission of creating equitable economic opportunities for workers, investors, and entrepreneurs really is about helping those three groups make money. That's how people make money. You either work for someone, you work for yourself, and maybe you invest and build things. \nSPEAKER_01:  But ultimately our department, our strategy, our city is designed around those three customers and how they make money. There's also seven focus areas in the current blueprint that have to do with the big \nSPEAKER_01:  economic inclusion, jobs and workforce development, development, environment, real estate, and so forth. \nSPEAKER_01:  that are organized by objectives and recommendations with specific activities. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the Council and the Department have been implementing over these past five years. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's also a pretty robust implementation plan that we follow with regard to distribution. I'm very proud to call out that Eric Romero over here has helped us with four translations. We're in Mandarin, Kamei. \nSPEAKER_01:  or in Spanish or in English. And this blueprint has actually gone all over the world. We have international trade missions come and we give them blueprints in their language to show them how much we appreciate their investment and want them to build and long each other. \nSPEAKER_01:  but basically \nSPEAKER_01:  We need a vision for 2030. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so I am coming to the committee today to let you know how we're doing on this blueprint update. We will \nSPEAKER_01:  actually be incorporating a lot of the new \nSPEAKER_01:  Commission priorities and the Council priorities around racial reconciliation, addressing structural racism, Internet inclusivity and connecting Everyone to the Internet. We learned a lot of stuff in in COVID-19 that \nSPEAKER_01:  has to do with what we call now an essential workforce. We never used that terminology before. We never talked about the caring economy like we do now. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we're really focused a lot in this blueprints on updating our strategies and our focus for the new decade. \nSPEAKER_01:  and post COVID-19. We learned so many things. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we've already completed almost a year's worth of study on the blueprint going back to October 12th of 2020. We started our kickoff for the blueprint 2.0 for this new decade. And we've studied all these things, real estate development, small business support. We've brought in experts from health care and \nSPEAKER_01:  from our big growth engines. \nSPEAKER_01:  But we've had all these study sessions. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we are now in the process of taking all that learning and putting it into our new recommendations. So one other thing that's really neat about this commission, this economic development commission is that \nSPEAKER_01:  They are really a working commission. They actually have expertise in all those different areas that I mentioned. \nSPEAKER_01:  so they will be \nSPEAKER_01:  championing each of them a different focus area. \nSPEAKER_01:  and actually it will be the commissioners who help to write this blueprint. It will not be a consultant, it will not be some sort of outside entity. This will be your commissioners writing the blueprint 2.0 for you and we will come back \nSPEAKER_01:  in the next couple months to bring that to the Economic Development and Finance Committee. So if you remember, \nSPEAKER_01:  last time. \nSPEAKER_01:  The Commission adopted the blueprint. \nSPEAKER_01:  and sent it to the committee. In the committee, then \nSPEAKER_01:  worked on the blueprint for about two to three months. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then forward in those recommendations to the Council for Final Approval. So our goal is to come \nSPEAKER_01:  to the Economic Development and Finance Committee, either in January or February. \nSPEAKER_01:  depending on when our meeting takes place in the beginning of the year. \nSPEAKER_01:  and maybe we have two meetings. \nSPEAKER_01:  finalize the final recommendations. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bless you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  to do the final final recommendation from the committee in March to the City Council. And then the council would of course adopt the final. \nSPEAKER_01:  Blueprint 2.0, division for 2030. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then we have a big party in April, the five year anniversary, as we retire one. \nSPEAKER_01:  and introduce the new vision for economic development. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  In any case, that's my report. It's an exciting time. The commission is charged up. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're having robust discussions about \nSPEAKER_01:  this blueprint 2.0 and what the future of our economy holds. \nSPEAKER_01:  but I will stop there and answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  as we wrap up today. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Any comments or questions? \nSPEAKER_02:  I just want to say, just thank you, Eric. \nSPEAKER_02:  And thank you, John, for all your work on this over the years. I can't believe it's five years already. \nSPEAKER_02:  My goodness, time is just... \nSPEAKER_02:  of fly as flown by. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I do look forward to the 2.0 version and \nSPEAKER_02:  just what this looks like over the next 10 years and especially excited. \nSPEAKER_02:  that I'm here working side by side with you on this. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I really appreciate your work. \nSPEAKER_02:  Eric and John and just really excited about this next step. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can't remember just because this Blast Blueprint was so well designed and it was so beautiful, the pictures, the formatting, there was a great \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  firm that helped us with that, but we're going to need a new color scheme. We're going to need something to capture the brand of the new blueprints. So if you could start thinking about that, we're really looking forward to that input. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  brand. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_01:  my first recommendation. \nSPEAKER_03:  we'll have it match our welcome signs. \nSPEAKER_03:  really draw from that theme. \nSPEAKER_03:  Because we need to start using them everything that we do. I love that I saw where was I driving. I saw it in the crosswalk somewhere. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think there's Norse Way that has crosswalks that match the welcome signs now. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know we need more welcome signs, but they're quite expensive. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just want to thank you all for what you've done. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know that \nSPEAKER_03:  Five years ago, I spent a considerable amount of time with commissioners. \nSPEAKER_03:  Monday was one of my first meetings that I wasn't able to tune in to and listen to the number of the public. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I do love listening to the economic development. \nSPEAKER_03:  Committee meetings, a commission meetings. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have some phenomenal commissioners and I'm just appreciative that we have some phenomenal staff. \nSPEAKER_03:  I won't get into the details but \nSPEAKER_03:  when I'm on my city manager briefings and things come up about \nSPEAKER_03:  sections or divisions or departments or \nSPEAKER_03:  Who people report to? I'm sometimes like \nSPEAKER_03:  Shouldn't that be an economic development? \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that's in our blue print. We should find a way to... \nSPEAKER_03:  move that under economic development, not that I want you to have more responsibility because you already have a lot on your plate. \nSPEAKER_03:  But there's a lot of talent in the city and we're very thankful for it and I feel like we're blessed to have so many. \nSPEAKER_03:  individuals that \nSPEAKER_03:  even though it's not there. \nSPEAKER_03:  quote unquote, job description to be an ambassador for Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  We just are blessed to have those people each and every day and I'm glad to now have another one of them who was a community member as a council colleague \nSPEAKER_03:  who I think was one of our best advocates across. \nSPEAKER_03:  the region. So thank you for all that you're doing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for everything you do with all those trade missions. I know they're not easy. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we've done a few of them in the county and \nSPEAKER_03:  They go a lot of work goes into those. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I've recently met with a couple of different ambassadors to the United States from other countries that have some big ideas. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know that I brought one by John's office. \nSPEAKER_03:  People are interested in moving to the US and they're specifically interested in moving along Beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we need to make sure that we know which are a best fit for us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and which provide us benefit even when they're not \nSPEAKER_03:  Exactly at our city borders. \nSPEAKER_03:  but the ones that really need to push in our city borders and all. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll say one pitch for \nSPEAKER_03:  Something that Council Member Richardson and I started working on a long time ago, we really need to kind of follow up on. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  when \nSPEAKER_03:  The mayor asked me to take this committee on again as Chairwoman. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was excited to do it, but there was a component of it that I thought was kind of missing. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know it's something that's not really under either of you, but it's just general revenue. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think that the time has come for us to have a discussion about \nSPEAKER_03:  the taxation and revenue components that come with a vision for 2030. \nSPEAKER_03:  and what that means to state legislation and the advocacy that we provide. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sales tax revenue is not the future. \nSPEAKER_03:  cities need to be incentivized to bring high-pay jobs. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so discussing and understanding how that income tax component \nSPEAKER_03:  could be of greater benefit to the cities that really invest in the industries that bring \nSPEAKER_03:  careers and high-paying jobs and legislative policy that increases the wages and lifts up the people that live here. I think the time has come for that discussion and I look forward to finding a way to work that into our \nSPEAKER_03:  our discussion. And then I know the other component that the mayor and I talked about was Grant. \nSPEAKER_03:  They don't know that we've come up with a meaningful way for that to fit together yet. \nSPEAKER_03:  But now the administration changed, so did a lot of the funding priorities and the national priorities and a lot of those things. And so, \nSPEAKER_03:  of \nSPEAKER_03:  We're very fortunate to be as plugged in as we are and then we really need to institutionalize that for the next three years. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much. And I just wanted one last introduction. I want to thank my colleague the new \nSPEAKER_01:  Finance Director Kevin Reiber for being here today. \nSPEAKER_01:  And he is a visionary and I believe that we are going to have a lot of fun working on. \nSPEAKER_01:  revenue development together over the next couple of years. So just want to thank Kevin and of course \nSPEAKER_01:  Nick Schultz, our deputy director and the executive director for \nSPEAKER_01:  Pacific Gateway, we have our federal workforce. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bureau so we're very fortunate. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_01:  Council members. \nSPEAKER_02:  and just want them. \nSPEAKER_02:  Kevin, it's nice to, I mean, you appreciate your work. When you do your report in the future, could you include who the commissioners are just so? \nSPEAKER_02:  That's in the report on the next blue print, please. \nSPEAKER_03:  Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Great, we have a motion in a second. I see no public comment. We'll go ahead and take a quick vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then we'll adjourn by consensus. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we have no public, open public comment at the end of the meeting. So I just want to put that all around. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye, sure, Ellen. \nSPEAKER_03:  The screens are for link. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you."
