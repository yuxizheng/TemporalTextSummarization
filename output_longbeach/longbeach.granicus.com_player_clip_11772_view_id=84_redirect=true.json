So this is a special meeting of the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  It came to our attention that one of the applicants who was chosen last week randomly headed with draw and so staff is going to give us a brief report on that and while that happens I'm going to move into position for the drawing of a new applicant for that district. But before we proceed or as part of your report is there any public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_00:  No, we didn't receive any e-commerce or emails for this meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. And what staff has advised me is that once we do this process, then we will, there will be a motion and a second to approve the new candidate moving forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are there any questions for me before I, or what discussion before JT gives a report? Because I'm going to move to the other position. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair Weiss. This will just be real quick. I'll just give a brief report regarding the additional random selection. So over the weekend applicant CD2-38 Milton Smith who was randomly selected as the Council District to Commissioner, he withdrew from the selection process for the Independent Redistricting Commission. Following that, we reach out to the two remaining Council District to applicants in the sub pool and confirm their interest in the commission. And today, Chair Weiss will be selecting from applicant CD2-5, Jenna Beckenhawk, and CD2-21 Ryan Giffin. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that concludes our staff report and we're available for any questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right, so we have two balls to put in the box, number 21. \nSPEAKER_03:  And number five. \nSPEAKER_03:  The candidate is number 21. \nSPEAKER_02:  CD2-21 is Ryan Giffin. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  So then let's proceed. I believe what we need is a motion and a second to approve. Candate 21 from district two. Ryan Giffin to move forward in accordance with the requirements of the city and the charter. \nSPEAKER_04:  We also needed withdrawal of the candidate that withdrew or just automatically have it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do we also need to accept the withdrawal of the candidate that was through? \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that's more. Sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sure that couldn't hurt as part of the motion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I'll move that we accept the withdrawal of Milton and it, remind me of what his last name is. \nSPEAKER_02:  Milton Smith. \nSPEAKER_04: culus. third up \nSPEAKER_04:  select candidate number 21 Ryan Giffin to fill the vacancy for at least a seat on council district two \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  All set again. \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there any discussion questions? \nSPEAKER_03:  Seeing none, please take the roll. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Mr. Feudler. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Mr. Nishatwa. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Vice-chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Why? \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Russian Karies. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. There is no public comment. Is there anything further than anyone has to bring you"
