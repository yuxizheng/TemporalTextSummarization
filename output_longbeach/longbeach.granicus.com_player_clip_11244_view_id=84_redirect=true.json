        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  Thank you Bob. I'll go ahead and kick this off and at some point I'll have Diana Sasser from National Development Council chime in. The commissioners as you're aware the Long Beach Micron Enterprise Loan program has been in existence for a number of years. And this body meaning the loan committee has been in charge of approval, review and approval of those loans. In light of the current situation we realized and have received a number of calls from our borrowers that \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, these are unusual times and we need some sort of relief. In response to that, we are proposing and we are working with the \nSPEAKER_01:  are funding sources which is the economic development administration. \nSPEAKER_01:  to modify our agreement, which is the \nSPEAKER_01:  administrative plan we submitted back in 2015 to allow some flexibility for these loans. What we are proposing and you all have received sort of a narrative and the letter or the text that we have sent them that outlines what we are proposing in terms of changes to the program. In short, we are asking economic development administration to allow us to defer \nSPEAKER_01:  principle and interest payments for all borrowers for a period of nine months. Same time we are also investing in whether that can everything can be basically frozen terms of accruing interest for the duration of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  a deferment time. \nSPEAKER_01:  EDA in \nSPEAKER_01:  sort of conversation that we had with our contacts in Seattle has \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Ashes to submit a proposal that will should be approved by this body. And once we share the minutes of this meeting with the EDA, they will take this request under consideration. We don't honestly see much of a resistance. They are certainly sympathizing with \nSPEAKER_01:  the ask and hopefully once we get their approval \nSPEAKER_01:  starting on Monday we will be issuing a letter \nSPEAKER_01:  and I'm already working with Diana to issue. \nSPEAKER_01:  a statement asking them if they accept this offer. \nSPEAKER_01:  And if so, then we will let our service in agent \nSPEAKER_01:  know that all these all loans are deferred for a period of nine months. So that's one quick fix that we found that is within our purview to take some pressure of the existing applicant. And we need \nSPEAKER_01:  Obviously, we need your approval to move forward in order to receive that approval from the EDA as well. One other item we added to this request is to include nonprofits which we have never made a loan to. In case there are some nonprofits later on that can tap into the source of funding, we can use them as well. So that doesn't really apply to any of our existing loans but for the time being the nine month deferment is what's being proposed. Diana, do you have anything to add please? \nSPEAKER_02:  I just have a quick question for you, so you've discussed it, but it may have just gotten missed because we've been trained in. \nSPEAKER_02:  doing a million things. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_02:  the intention offered to defer the accrual of interest. \nSPEAKER_02:  during that deferment, because I know we talked about it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  That will be... \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  So yeah, so you know, it's not only deferring, but not also increasing their payments at the end of the day. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  the idea is for them to be able to. \nSPEAKER_02:  get back on and you know. \nSPEAKER_02:  be able to start making their payments again hopefully in nine months. \nSPEAKER_02:  that there's hopefully still open. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would, for now, the question came up, obviously, \nSPEAKER_01:  This causes a balloon payment at the end of the term. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then also the concern was \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, how does that affect the term of the loan? At this time, honestly, folks, I think we just go ahead and do this. If we have to go back nine months from now and amend all of our promissory notes and agreements to extend the loan, so be it. So for now, I'm telling clients and borrowers don't worry. \nSPEAKER_00:  time. \nSPEAKER_01:  When the time comes after nine months, we will work with you and allow you to continue making payments even after the term of the loan. There has to be some sort of a \nSPEAKER_01:  agreement which we will work with our city attorney. \nSPEAKER_01:  during that period. So I'm not really worried about it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I agree with you, Sayade, because I think that, you know, just to do that takes time. This is something we can do quickly and can affect them immediately. And I don't want something like \nSPEAKER_02:  of paperwork that, you know, we can do in a couple of months. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  that holds it up. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so starting on Monday, everyone will receive some sort of a correspondence from us with a blank form to say, I agree. I, one of the borrowers already said, you know, I'm okay. I really don't need a deferment. So that gives them the option to accept our offer or decline it. And that way we have some legal \nSPEAKER_02:  Starting. \nSPEAKER_01:  paperwork for the auditing permits. Any questions from the Commissioners, please? \nSPEAKER_04:  I've got one question. So are we going to prove any loans moving forward and is it going to be in the same conditions that we're describing now? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, that would be the next item commissioner, a lot of things and we will, that item number three for a new program and that's, that's that'll be an interesting conversation. But for now, we are just asking, we are just asking if the loan committee will approve us to move forward with this deferment for a period of nine months. \nSPEAKER_00:  We are just asking. \nSPEAKER_01:  with no interest accrued. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so move. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, second, it's obvious and it's necessary and we have to. So by all means. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so I've already reached out to most of the borrowers by phone. They know it's coming, but in the event, you, one of your constituents asked you and happened to have a long \nSPEAKER_01:  With us, just please feel free to direct them to me. \nSPEAKER_01:  on this matter. So we do have a vote any \nSPEAKER_01:  objections? \nSPEAKER_01:  As unanimous, there are no public comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bob can remove to item number three, please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good night. \nSPEAKER_00:  Recommendation to establish an emergency business loan program in response to effective co-vade 19 on local businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  Wonderful. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, this is a brand new program. We are fortunate in hearing the city that we already have the \nSPEAKER_01:  sort of an infrastructure to implement something new based on what we've done in the past. \nSPEAKER_01:  what we have discussed internally and with the NDC, our underwriter is \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  to take the balance of the revolving loan fund and that's the same fund that all those previous loans that loan committee has approved. \nSPEAKER_01:  We are talking about 600 maybe 650 thousand dollars and take that balance and start making very \nSPEAKER_01:  small loans in response to the COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_01:  problem. So what's been proposed and what's been submitted to the Economic Development Administration and subsequently may have to be approved by the City Council because they approved our Economic Development Plan is new loans from $2,500 to $10,000. \nSPEAKER_01:  it will be done at FX rate, which is the \nSPEAKER_01:  lowest allowable rate Diana were we out today with the prime \nSPEAKER_02:  So 75% of prime is at 3.25%. \nSPEAKER_02:  based on the brief."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  drop the mid. \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_04:  before in between meeting drops that they did earlier were like Friday or Saturday. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So it's at 3.25%, that drops to 8 to 2.4%. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, so it'll be a fix rate of as of today, 2.4% for a period of 5 to 7 years, most likely 5 years. \nSPEAKER_06:  and again loans range from 2500 to 10,000. I have a feeling everybody's going to ask for 10,000. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the source of money is the same pool of funds we've used in the past. \nSPEAKER_06:  And there is in the notes you might see that we are asking for a deferral, these loans will be deferred up to six months, actually has to be, we are proposing nine months. So if your notes say six months we need to amend that and they'll vote on it accordingly. There will be no fee in the past, we always charge 2% loan fee, and this particular loan will have no fee. We expect and we have been receiving literally hundreds of calls since a couple of days ago. Just to let you know the city set up a new hotline 5704 number 4BICBiz. That number that phone comes directly to my office. Of course I have help and people receiving calls and it... \nSPEAKER_06:  It rings non-stop and even after hours. So we are taking those calls and those that we feel fit this particular program. We are keeping track of those and all those individuals will receive applications starting on Monday. \nSPEAKER_06:  meantime Diana has helped me to \nSPEAKER_06:  come up with a simple application process. Obviously we don't we want this to be as streamlined and as \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, the most convenient way people can apply for. We already have an application and require documents. We also have asked the help from the small business development center and they have a team on standby to \nSPEAKER_06:  taking the application and do the initial check to make sure all documents are in order. And if needed, if people need technical assistance to make that application completely, make it more palatable SBDCs, on standby to do that. The initial underwriting will be done in-house. So as before, Diana and someone from NDC who is volunteer to help. \nSPEAKER_06:  and myself will do the initial \nSPEAKER_06:  credit on the writing. \nSPEAKER_06:  and staff, meaning city staff. \nSPEAKER_06:  will prepare all necessary documents and \nSPEAKER_06:  subsequent payment. Ideally, when an application is received, if it's fully incompliance completed, comes to us, we do our underwriting, and then for the payment, we are looking at anywhere from five to seven days to get these loans out. So, you're ready? \nSPEAKER_03:  Ready? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah theoretically if everyone asks for $10,000 we only can do 60 loans. In the meantime I will work with our staff \nSPEAKER_06:  to submit a new application. \nSPEAKER_06:  to the economic development administration for a $1.6 million dollar. \nSPEAKER_06:  Grant that needs to be matched by $400,000 of CD money. \nSPEAKER_06:  and I'm not sure how fast that money will come around. \nSPEAKER_06:  but that would be, uh, oh, \nSPEAKER_06:  the only way we can... \nSPEAKER_06:  put more money into this pool of funds. But for right now we do have funding and we can loan up to 600 or 650 thousand dollars. \nSPEAKER_06:  So again, the proposed loan is maximum of 10,000. The term will be 5 to 7 years. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the rate as Diana mentioned currently is very low of 75% of the prime. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then we will give all \nSPEAKER_06:  borrowers nine months to repay back the loan. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that's just another... \nSPEAKER_06:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let me, I want to clarify that. Not nine months to pay back the loan. Nine months before they have to start making payments on the loan. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, I said. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then it's a five to seven year term. \nSPEAKER_06:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the idea would be, you know, it'll still be lower. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I want to clarify this is not, you know, something, there is going to be underwriting. \nSPEAKER_04:  happening. \nSPEAKER_04:  as SAID said, so it's not just going to be anybody that comes in to get $10,000. \nSPEAKER_04:  The idea is we're trying to be trying to help businesses that work going concern prior. \nSPEAKER_04:  to COVID coming in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  so prior to COVID shutting them down. If they were losing money left and right for COVID, that's not who we're trying to help. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're trying to help businesses that \nSPEAKER_04:  We're profitable, that we're working well, and so we're looking at two years of financial 50 what they were doing. \nSPEAKER_04:  Previously. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  And if they're new... \nSPEAKER_04:  Great, that's still something we can look at and see if that's something that we can do. \nSPEAKER_04:  If they're not like, you know, they're six months old or something like that, we can still help them just \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, that's something. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we can do, but I just want to clarify that. \nSPEAKER_04:  We are not looking to do loans to businesses that we're failing in the first place. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're looking to do a lot because at the end of the day. \nSPEAKER_04:  They're the ones that really won't pass. \nSPEAKER_04:  We want to help the ones that we're going to survive. \nSPEAKER_04:  hopefully survive. \nSPEAKER_06:  And another note I can add to this is, unlike the previous program, this is not designed for startup businesses. So if you're thinking about starting a business, this program doesn't apply to you. \nSPEAKER_00:  starting \nSPEAKER_06:  but hopefully in the future when we get more funding under the economic development administration plan. \nSPEAKER_06:  we will be able to make more startup loads as \nSPEAKER_06:  We have done it in the past. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right. \nSPEAKER_06:  So at this time, I think I want to open it up to discussion from commissioners if you have any questions. And again, this is a program that you can certainly talk about with. \nSPEAKER_06:  your colleagues and the business community. \nSPEAKER_06:  and it will be launched sometime early next week. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, I've got the couple of questions. One is \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  Someone asked me about whether this would impact \nSPEAKER_05:  Obviously, SBA has some sort of program which I haven't seen yet, I'm not sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  I know. \nSPEAKER_05:  President Trump. \nSPEAKER_05:  did approve the spending. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you \nSPEAKER_05:  A few days ago, so there was a lot of stuff I'm sure that was supposed to be in that, but the question was \nSPEAKER_05:  whether \nSPEAKER_05:  if they apply for an SBA loan. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, the money. \nSPEAKER_05:  that they're getting from the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh... just qualified and somehow offset \nSPEAKER_05:  the amount the money they can get from SBA. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's a good question. I don't think, I mean, we're not looking at a large amount. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that, you know, SBA is going to want to know, you know, are you applying for any other disaster fund? \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  but you know, FBA's loan amount can go up to $2 million. And back to you. \nSPEAKER_04:  out. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Larkin's side I've sent you guys some information and we actually had there's a whole website. It's directly so does after funds come directly from the SBA so banks. \nSPEAKER_04:  are not doing this after all. \nSPEAKER_04:  They go all, they have to go to the SBA website and there's an application there. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we'll see you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Guys, some information. \nSPEAKER_04:  But it's up to $2 million they're offering it at 3.75% and it has to be a designated disaster area. \nSPEAKER_04:  Good day. \nSPEAKER_04:  California is it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Something like that. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  We're good. \nSPEAKER_00:  We're good. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ah! \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we can send you guys information on that. I don't think it was negatively impacts them because \nSPEAKER_03:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, they might say, oh, well, you're getting 10,000. So you can get $10,000 less from us. I don't. \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't think that they're going to do that negatively. \nSPEAKER_04:  especially since this can move faster. We're also not. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let me clarify a few things. We... \nSPEAKER_04:  This is even simpler than normal program. And this is an emergency loan program. It is not intended to be \nSPEAKER_04:  what we do. \nSPEAKER_04:  completely going forward. Our intention is to be able to go back to what we used to. \nSPEAKER_05:  We do that, we have to approach. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f myself \nSPEAKER_04:  I was just gonna make sure that you guys, you know, there's not, we're not even putting personal guarantees on this. We're just really doing this. \nSPEAKER_04:  to the business, for the business. \nSPEAKER_04:  on the business. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  mission. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  You can walk in. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, well, my next question is sort of. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I talked to one of my banker buddies and \nSPEAKER_05:  And he hadn't heard anything he heard that there was some \nSPEAKER_05:  money becoming available. \nSPEAKER_05:  benefit to the S pen. \nSPEAKER_05:  But the banks haven't heard anything about it. So if I understand you correctly, this is going to run by the SBA itself, and the bank can't hurt me in a second. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  And if your banker, he needs to talk to his SBA folks, because the SBA folks at the bank should know about it. \nSPEAKER_04:  and stay gone. \nSPEAKER_04:  Then there was a huge call today. \nSPEAKER_04:  by the SBA, all of that stuff. I didn't get to participate because I've been on the phone consistently. \nSPEAKER_04:  But grow America fund, which is an FDA lender, which does as one of our grow long beach funds. \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_04:  They have been keeping me abreast about everything. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  The link to... \nSPEAKER_05:  We're working in power for the $10,000 and also for the SBA. \nSPEAKER_05:  alone situation. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I'll let the Eric Romero chime in. We already have set up a website that has access, serves as a cleaning house of information with the links to all that. With regard to the SBA commission and Larkins, I've been getting calls again all day and people give me feedback. Couple of things on the SBA. Yes, it is a direct SBA program. The minimum requires score, I understand, is 660. So if you fall below that threshold, unfortunately, it doesn't apply to you. And there's another catch. Apparently, if you're a business that's already laid off people or is trying to lay off people, you will not be able to tap into that pool of funds. So unfortunately, that rules out a lot of our businesses, restaurants, especially that have no choice, but downsize their workforce. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, that's the horrible thing to put on the deal. I mean, these are racial businesses could potentially hire back some of these people. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_06:  I believe that's the case, but I'm just giving you feedback. I've been receiving from some of the clients that we send a link to. But we have a very comprehensive website right now that connects people to all types of resources, EDD, you know, other partners in the community that are lending money. And hopefully that, and we've been sending it to people as they call us. One other item that is very important for us to discuss as part of this item is, understanding that these loans need to be processed and dispersed quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's the case. \nSPEAKER_06:  My dilemma and my challenge here is, and I, \nSPEAKER_06:  I throw this to the committee is under the plan, business loan committee is the body that approves all of our economic development loans. Now for this particular new emergency loan, if you wish to be still involved, I just need a lot more flexibility from the loan committee to be available to meet on more regular \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  basis. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not daily basis. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I'm hoping maybe we just get a whole list of 10, 20 loans and do them all at the same time, but nevertheless still the bottom you need to be present via phone to just like today to vote on it. The only other option is \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, \nSPEAKER_06:  That would be really planned. The is if you delegate that task to the staff to do the underwriting and decision making for the loans. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, it doesn't matter to us, but I think historically \nSPEAKER_06:  the Economic Development Commission and the Loan Committee. \nSPEAKER_06:  is been the body that had jurisdiction over this type of \nSPEAKER_06:  matters. So I'd leave it up to you folks. If you're flexible, \nSPEAKER_06:  to be available over the phone to do these type of meetings, then we just leave it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Leave it as is. \nSPEAKER_05:  \u0625\u0646\u0647\u0627cies \u0646\u0644\u0627\u0645 BS \nSPEAKER_05:  Let me ask you on that subject then. It's really just two things that \nSPEAKER_05:  We could potentially decide one. \nSPEAKER_05:  Obviously we'd have to be available. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we're creating our own little bottleneck if there are hundreds of people that are \nSPEAKER_05:  going to be applying. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then... \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't want to, it might be my personal opinion. I don't want the committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  to be the bottleneck. \nSPEAKER_05:  to moving this thing. \nSPEAKER_05:  forward in case \nSPEAKER_05:  Whatever happens, we can't get together or quorum. \nSPEAKER_05:  or so Plan B is \nSPEAKER_05:  to the process we have right now, but meet more often to sort of handle the demand. \nSPEAKER_05:  out. \nSPEAKER_05:  plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  plan that's that's a current plan plan B. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_05:  would be \nSPEAKER_05:  And delegate the action. \nSPEAKER_06:  Rel Protect. \nSPEAKER_06:  to delegate. \nSPEAKER_05:  Delegate. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05: \u3067\u3059 today i want to \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_05:  during this particular time. \nSPEAKER_05:  for this particular program. \nSPEAKER_05:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_05:  to the staff. \nSPEAKER_05:  to make these decisions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is that what I hear you saying? \nSPEAKER_06:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the plan be expedited the process. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, well I plan to be... \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so I like to amend the original motion that you guys are asking for to include. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  on emergency bases. \nSPEAKER_05:  for these loans. \nSPEAKER_05:  uh... to \nSPEAKER_05:  so that will give you \nSPEAKER_05:  that the staff \nSPEAKER_05:  and they're underwriting. \nSPEAKER_05:  can approve these types of loans. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's a motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  all second. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Molina. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm with you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  and with the Walter State at the same one more time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so. \nSPEAKER_05:  addition to the recommendation that they have at this loan program. \nSPEAKER_05:  proceed. \nSPEAKER_05:  The recommendation would be. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  We, during this \nSPEAKER_05:  for these emergency loans. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we authorize the staff without approval from the loan committee. \nSPEAKER_05:  to approve and do underwriting. \nSPEAKER_05:  for these low. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, so we don't hold up the process. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, all right, well, that's second for sure. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  We have emotion. \nSPEAKER_06:  uh \nSPEAKER_06:  On table, Bob, did you write it down? \nSPEAKER_06:  You know what the motion is right. \nSPEAKER_06:  been let us take. \nSPEAKER_06:  We need the motion, we need the second. Was that Commissioner Molina? \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I seconded. \nSPEAKER_03:  and so did the player show. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  So all in favor? \nSPEAKER_03:  I won't fight him for that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  All in favor, motion passes. Any public comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Just again for clarification, commissioners. \nSPEAKER_06:  As it's been done in the past, staff and NDC, we do our due diligence to make sure these loans by the time they get to the committee. \nSPEAKER_06:  and we always come forward with a recommendation for approval are strong enough granted some of these loans. \nSPEAKER_06:  you know, will fail, unfortunately, and that's inevitable, but we'll do our best in our underwriting practice. \nSPEAKER_06:  to make sure we pick the ones that have the most likelihood of succeeding. But again, this is an emergency loan and we are taking more of a risk as we \nSPEAKER_06:  did not with the previous program. \nSPEAKER_05:  You said I got one question. OK, so we've approved a number of loans in the past. \nSPEAKER_05:  Should we get priority to those people who already have loans? \nSPEAKER_05:  with the \nSPEAKER_05:  who was this city \nSPEAKER_05:  that because of the situation. \nSPEAKER_05:  have thundered themselves in \nSPEAKER_05:  uh, financially good luck. \nSPEAKER_06:  Frankly, we are giving those folks already an option of in case the commissioner Molina joined us a little late the previous item Covered the existing loans that will be deferred for a period of nine months. I think that's enough of an incentive \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you very much, everybody. \nSPEAKER_05:  for if you need additional, additional capital. \nSPEAKER_05:  Dead. \nSPEAKER_05:  You know, they were growing their businesses nicely, everything was going great, they were paying their loans, the issue was in best days. \nSPEAKER_05:  can't be there alone. \nSPEAKER_05:  is that they don't have enough cash right now. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Absolutely. To continue up. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  and write like the instrument. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Honestly, I think that... \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, I think they can apply. \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't think that we should restrict them from being able to apply. \nSPEAKER_04:  But I think we're really going to take this on a first come first serve with the people that provide us the information, the financial information. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're gonna move through. Yeah, nothing would go that way. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, nothing would pro pro pro \nSPEAKER_06:  Nothing would rule them out. I mean we take applications as they come and if it happens to be one of our existing loan applicants Absolutely, they will look at case by case. So to answer the question there open \nSPEAKER_05:  As a question, they're open. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I want me to question regarding that, was that. \nSPEAKER_05:  We, the city, when this thing goes over, obviously, if we have people defaulting on the existing loans, whether they get a nine month appointment. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're not because they don't have cash to operate. \nSPEAKER_06:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, the Rift of the City of Pire. \nSPEAKER_05:  and our \nSPEAKER_05:  loans. \nSPEAKER_05:  There it is. \nSPEAKER_05:  on \nSPEAKER_05:  Someone who is brand new. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  don't have a relationship. \nSPEAKER_05:  Cory. \nSPEAKER_05:  And thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  All we can do is encourage them to apply. \nSPEAKER_04:  And honestly, when I do the evaluation, it makes my life just a little easier. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  because \nSPEAKER_04:  I already have some information on them. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm just suggesting that we might do some more direct outreach to those businesses. \nSPEAKER_05:  We will \nSPEAKER_04:  We will be because \nSPEAKER_04:  when we're doing the referral. \nSPEAKER_04:  email. \nSPEAKER_04:  We will also email them and let them know that this is coming. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_04:  And honestly, most of them have reached out.
