Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_05:  You have. \nSPEAKER_05:  three minutes to speak. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Brian Matheson here. \nSPEAKER_00:  And this is about the right to council align item. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't think spending 250,000 on a new program for legal aid is a prudent move in a budget cutting environment. \nSPEAKER_00:  especially since we have the Shriver Act and the Legal Aid Foundation on Pacific Avenue to assist tenants. \nSPEAKER_00:  I also heard there was a couple of positions in the police department's sexual assault unit that are being cut. \nSPEAKER_00:  seems so like to me to spend money to duplicate tenant assistant programs already in existence. \nSPEAKER_00:  and cut programs to track down child molesters. \nSPEAKER_00:  There may be a significant cross section of voters that might be upset with cutting the sexual predator units. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would also encourage the council in general to ease off the let litigate trend. \nSPEAKER_00:  Your city has 23 different labor bargaining. \nSPEAKER_00:  and their attempts to solve differences all started out with written requests to solve a problem. \nSPEAKER_00:  the California Association of Realtors stresses the mediation prior to litigating and all their purchase contracts. \nSPEAKER_00:  You should consider being more progressive and resolving disputes amongst your constituents. \nSPEAKER_00:  and stop using the litigate sledgehammer as a starting point to solve problems. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_00:  appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mike Merchuson, you have three minutes to speak. Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, Chair Austin, Councilmembers, Joranga and Price. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for giving me a couple minutes here. \nSPEAKER_01:  I just want to let you know on behalf of the small propioners of Lions and the apartment association here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's hundreds and hundreds of landlords have become aware of Merikar sias. \nSPEAKER_01:  line item on the 20000 E1s allocated to tenant rights groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  to assist tenants with legally pursuing landlords. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is caused quite the stir in the landlord community. \nSPEAKER_01:  and they're very upset by it. So we're asking that you respectfully redirect those funds to where they should be. \nSPEAKER_01:  which used to library services have been cut. Some of our concert series have been cut. \nSPEAKER_01:  as Brian mentioned, the police budget and so on and so on. This is not the time to be giving money to 10 rights groups to. \nSPEAKER_01:  proactively litigate against landlords. I appreciate your consideration. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_05:  Harrison Hyde, you have three minutes to speak. Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Council members, for letting me speak today. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm here to oppose the budget proposal to allocate 250,000 to help pennant split against the landlords in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  I understand the pandemic has had far reaching effects in our economy if nobody could have seen coming. \nSPEAKER_02:  the property owners at this point are fed up. \nSPEAKER_02:  As a multi-family broker, I'm making between 200, 300 calls of data owners and long beach. Most owners I'm talking to are not large syndicators, investment funds looking to maximize returns for their investors. \nSPEAKER_02:  These are mom and pop owners who are your neighbors, family, and friends. \nSPEAKER_02:  with the amount of housing legislation passed locally in statewide over the past few years. \nSPEAKER_02:  You basically need to have an attorney, you basically need to be an attorney to understand housing walls. \nSPEAKER_02:  At this point, most real estate attorneys have become conservative, but their legal advice through the amount of conflicting laws and harassing policies prevalent in Southern California Minus Palais. \nSPEAKER_02:  One wrong move can be. \nSPEAKER_02:  come one of the most cost mistakes for an owner. \nSPEAKER_02:  This only leads to more uncertainty for owners and furthers their frustrations. \nSPEAKER_02:  if this budget items pass. \nSPEAKER_02:  and a $250,000 fund is created. I fear that mom and pop owners will be forced out or smooth their money out of the country elsewhere. \nSPEAKER_02:  This will bring investment funds back to take their buildings up at discount and further along. Be just housing for ability crisis. Something nobody wants. \nSPEAKER_02:  For these reasons I'm asking for your budget item, allocating 250,000 to tenant litigation fund to remove. Thanks for the time. \nSPEAKER_04:  That concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  We appreciate public comment. Is there any comment from the council on this particular man it matter on this item number two? \nSPEAKER_03:  Nice to be a price. \nSPEAKER_06:  No comments from me. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilmember Yoragya. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ah, no comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  I will go ahead. I just maybe wanted to address one of the public comments. Staff is on the line. Our budget analyst. \nSPEAKER_03:  Clayhorn \nSPEAKER_03:  Where there are, I heard somebody say cuts to summer concert series. Is there a... \nSPEAKER_03:  The City Manager's budget proposes cuts to summer concert series. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, come. \nSPEAKER_06:  Austin as part of the parks, um, uh, budget proposal. There was a reduction to the center concert series that was about the $50,000. \nSPEAKER_06:  at summer concerts that were appropriated about \nSPEAKER_06:  seen out of the SAP funds. No reductions in other. \nSPEAKER_06:  events like the muniband or the other event, event funding that exists in the city manager's budget. But this is in the \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for that clarification, as I recall, that this summer concert series that we put into place was only in place the last year. Is that correct? Or two budgets, cycles? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, it was added in 2018. I believe 2018 or 2018. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  It was the community concerts about 50,000 for community concert tools added in FY19. \nSPEAKER_06:  and out of the special advertising and promotions fund group. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you and I just wanted to clarify that that does not mean an impact to the municipal ban. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_06:  Correct. Nothing has changed in terms of the municipal ban. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you so much. So with that, here are no other comments. It's been moved and seconded. Please call the vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  Kanzgelkagan Bill\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Vice Chair Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll see you next time."

Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I've done so thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon. The committee, my name is Ray Meiler. I live in Long Beach, I know two small residential properties. \nSPEAKER_01:  I pose the mayor's line item to create a legal defense fund for the tenant. \nSPEAKER_01:  This will only increase expenses for mom and pop housing providers. \nSPEAKER_01:  We already make much less than all of our tenants after all the risk we have taken. \nSPEAKER_01:  and hard work to provide housing to residents of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're already implying to be very reasonable with our tenants. \nSPEAKER_01:  that is kind of the nature of being a monopop owner. \nSPEAKER_01:  And you not understand why the council continuously throws obstacles in the way of providing housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  long Beach President. \nSPEAKER_01:  Several of the council members simply do not understand the business of providing housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  and really wish it was otherwise. If there's some opportunity, some us. \nSPEAKER_01:  We small property owners could sit down with particular council members and give them an education on the \nSPEAKER_01:  Mechanics are providing housing and we would be very open to doing that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Lydia Ringwald, you have three minutes to speak. Please, I'm your phone. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, we can. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, on the rental contract is a clause saying that the prevailing party in any litigation, the attorney's fees are paid by the prevailing party. \nSPEAKER_06:  So there shouldn't be any need for additional funding. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the $250,000 seems excessive. \nSPEAKER_06:  because how many tenants have actually been illegally or wrongly removed. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think in most cases. \nSPEAKER_06:  of property owners are keeping. \nSPEAKER_06:  that they're abiding by the rules and if the tenant can't pay, they barely stay there. They try to cooperate with the rules. So I would imagine they're very few. \nSPEAKER_06:  that are actually. \nSPEAKER_06:  wrongly removed. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I wondered if you had any statistics, how many people are... \nSPEAKER_06:  would be involved in that. \nSPEAKER_06:  It seemed like it'd be a small number and $250,000 is excessive. \nSPEAKER_06:  especially because \nSPEAKER_06:  the rental contract should... \nSPEAKER_06:  award attorney's fees to the prevailing party. \nSPEAKER_06:  Elementary, \nSPEAKER_06:  the landlord has done something wrong and the tenant wins. \nSPEAKER_06:  there. \nSPEAKER_06:  the landlord pays the attorney's fees of the tenant right there. \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you hear me okay? \nSPEAKER_05:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  We can hear you. \nSPEAKER_06:  or \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. OK. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, that's the basic point. And of course, another issue. It would be wonderful, too. \nSPEAKER_06:  invest these funds in something that would really benefit all of us. \nSPEAKER_06:  Maybe a beautiful mural for City Hall. \nSPEAKER_06:  something on the history of California, I'm working with the Long Beach Art Museum on that kind of an idea. \nSPEAKER_06:  And for that kind of fun even we would really have something long lasting and beautiful that would be an inspiration for everybody. \nSPEAKER_06:  to something uplifting. \nSPEAKER_06:  something for the human spirit. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would prefer seeing the funds go towards. \nSPEAKER_06:  something that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Aqueu uma alma ta gostosa! \nSPEAKER_06:  morally ethically and. \nSPEAKER_06:  inspirational. \nSPEAKER_06:  We need that now. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for your comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  to my request. \nSPEAKER_06:  No. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Rex, Pritchard, you have three minutes to speak. \nSPEAKER_03:  Please unmute your phone. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Rex Pritchard, President of Long Beach Firefighters Association. \nSPEAKER_02:  respectfully requesting the BOC to make a recommendation to full council. \nSPEAKER_02:  to keep the $400,000 in the fire department and keep one heart unit in service. \nSPEAKER_02:  versus creating another program. \nSPEAKER_02:  similar to the fire department's heart unit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  and the health department. \nSPEAKER_02:  My concern is, heart is a established program. \nSPEAKER_02:  doing good work in and out and for the health department to stand up in a similar program. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's going to take a greater investment than $400,000. So let's keep what's working. \nSPEAKER_02:  and have one heart unit left in the fire department. And then the second request would be instead of spending $200,000. \nSPEAKER_02:  for an outside consultant. \nSPEAKER_02:  use those dollars to help fund. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh, partial service restoration, potentially of the heart unit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  or some other service that the City Council sees fit. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that concludes public comment. Yes. I'd like to take it to the committee before I speak. Councilmember Yoronga, do you have any comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, I think that we pretty much discussed the budget pretty uh \nSPEAKER_04:  pretty much in depth and I think I'm ready to go. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, I don't disagree with you, love. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice to your price. \nSPEAKER_08:  I agree with Councilman Ranga and I look forward to hearing your recommendations. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, I will just say that it has been a great experience, humbling experience and honor to serve as chair of the Budget Oversight Committee during this very difficult year, 2020 FY21. And I will just say that facing a $30 million budget shortfall with some serious reductions proposed and sacrifices from everyone in this city, from employees to small businesses, to residents. Everybody is going to share in the sacrifice from what is being proposed here and what is facing us over the next fiscal year. I want to compliment \nSPEAKER_00:  My colleagues on the Budget Oversight Committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice Chair Price and \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember Yoronga for there. \nSPEAKER_00:  their professionalism, their support. \nSPEAKER_00:  their collegiality and for really digging in and understanding our fiscal \nSPEAKER_00:  situation here in the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  as a budget over side committee and also want to come in our staff who has worked around the clock. \nSPEAKER_00:  on. \nSPEAKER_00:  Financial management team. \nSPEAKER_00:  led by Jion Gross. I've had to privilege to work very closely with \nSPEAKER_00:  Grace you. \nSPEAKER_00:  And many others, and of course our city manager Tom Modica throughout this process. \nSPEAKER_00:  um... in \nSPEAKER_00:  I've also talked to many every one of our City Council members and taking their input into consideration. \nSPEAKER_00:  We've had a number of community budget meetings. \nSPEAKER_00:  Budget hearings, what we heard from the public. \nSPEAKER_00:  And all of that has gone into consideration to get us to this point where we are. \nSPEAKER_00:  today. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so with that, \nSPEAKER_00:  Again, I'd like to move. \nSPEAKER_00:  for \nSPEAKER_00:  Consideration and approval by the Budget Overtite Committee, the following recommendations. I want to ask, \nSPEAKER_00:  wish you to share that on the \nSPEAKER_00:  The screen on the SharePoint for those participating to see on the WebX. \nSPEAKER_00:  \u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0625\u0630\u0623\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \nSPEAKER_00:  Get that up. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, I believe share the recommendation. Are people able to see that? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, they're first up. So. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion A, in there are several motions here. We're going to make it one universal motion. OK, but there's a motion to support Mayor Garcia's proposed budget recommendations with the following changes. And that is to add the African American Cultural Center is one of the organizations receiving support and revise the allocation of funds as presented before you. \nSPEAKER_00:  This would essentially give $60,000 to \nSPEAKER_00:  One, two, three, four, five, six arts organizations, including the \nSPEAKER_00:  the African American Cultural Center, the Kamarata Singers of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach Playhouse. \nSPEAKER_00:  music and jellica. \nSPEAKER_00:  the International City Theater and the Long Beach Opera. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then $120,000. And this is all coming from measure B. \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach Museum of Art, it's a Long Beach Symphony Orchestra. \nSPEAKER_00:  the Museum of Latin American Art. \nSPEAKER_00:  The musical theater west and then $17,000 a 1% for the Measure B budget stabilization fund. And I'd like to just say thank the mayor for his input and support. On these recommendations, I've worked very closely with him to come up with a formula that works and it's fair for all of our arts organizations. This will be a great benefit to our city. \nSPEAKER_00:  The second motion is to delay the transfer of the hard teams from the Fire Department to the Health Department for an estimated six months until staff reports to City Council on the details of the proposed new model and plan. \nSPEAKER_00:  including information on how the transition will be implemented with no gaps in service. \nSPEAKER_00:  how the plants compare to net. \nSPEAKER_00:  national best practices and how \nSPEAKER_00:  if any medical regulations, requirements are required. \nSPEAKER_00:  or I'm sorry, requirements are being addressed. \nSPEAKER_00:  Recognize one time savings in the health department of 207,000 dollars. \nSPEAKER_00:  $200, $200, $200, $200 and \nSPEAKER_00:  at one time cost of the fire department of 435. \nSPEAKER_00:  $1232 resulting from the delay. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the total citywide impact to the general fund of 228,000. \nSPEAKER_00:  $32. \nSPEAKER_00:  C is a motion to revise the proposed business license increase on cannabis businesses from 1% increase to a 5% increase. And extend, I'm sorry, to a 0.5% increase. And extend business hours for dispensaries by two hours, resulting in a lower projected journal fund, group revenues by $200,000. \nSPEAKER_00:  D \nSPEAKER_04:  I think getting on the heart attack with a 5% \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's a point five percent. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for the clarification. \nSPEAKER_00:  D is a motion to add one-time funds of $350,000 in the general fund group for a fireworks enforcement team pilot in FY21 to mitigate the illegal use of fireworks and explosives in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  E is a motion to appropriate $95,374 in the General Fund in the police department to structurally support \nSPEAKER_00:  The expansion of coverage and services typically done by park rangers to include Bixby Park and MacArthur Park. \nSPEAKER_00:  and request the city manager to report back in early FY21 on an implementation plan, which can include the hiring of a park ranger position or other operational models to accomplish the service goal. \nSPEAKER_00:  F is in motion to appropriate $339,000 in $44 in the general fund to the police department to structurally restore two detectives in the sexual, I'm sorry, violent sexual predator unit. \nSPEAKER_00:  Detectives division. \nSPEAKER_00:  as a result. \nSPEAKER_00:  not to include the proposed addition of a police investigator or non-career position. These positions are assigned to monitor and investigate sex offender compliance. \nSPEAKER_00:  G, the motion to appropriate $213,320 in a general fund group in the police department to structurally restore one position in the canine unit. The proposed budget had reduced three police officer positions in this motion results in a total of only two police officer positions being reduced. \nSPEAKER_00:  H, the motion is to reduce $600,000 in a general fund group on a one-time basis, or the police south division PIN overtime program, leaving $125,000 remaining in the program for FYI-21 to help temporarily offset the restoration of the violent sexual credit unit and the K9 unit positions. \nSPEAKER_00:  and the additional support of a park ranger related coverage services. \nSPEAKER_00:  and services. \nSPEAKER_00:  I is a motion to request elected departments. \nSPEAKER_00:  contribute additional structural reductions from approximately 4% to approximately 5% of their budgets for an additional general fund group savings of $188,655. \nSPEAKER_00:  This will be an additional reduction of $27,900. \nSPEAKER_00:  $82, excuse me, for the City Auditor, 64,000. \nSPEAKER_00:  $375 for the city prosecutor. \nSPEAKER_00:  $62,834 for the legislative department. \nSPEAKER_00:  Meaning all city council offices and mayor. \nSPEAKER_00:  and $33,464 for the city attorney. \nSPEAKER_00:  Next motion is J. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that is to increase the current 1.5. \nSPEAKER_00:  percent general fund group vacancy factor for non-swarm personnel to 1.8 for FY21. \nSPEAKER_00:  A percent, excuse me. \nSPEAKER_00:  for FY21. Generating the one time savings of 465,600 \nSPEAKER_00:  in $6 in FY21 to reflect potential budget reductions. \nSPEAKER_00:  in FY22. \nSPEAKER_00:  include in technical \nSPEAKER_00:  Adjustments. \nSPEAKER_00:  to the existing 1.5% vacancy savings factor, saving an additional $171,509 in the general fund group. This results in a total FY savings of 637. \nSPEAKER_00:  $115 in the General Fund Group. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion K. \nSPEAKER_00:  is to increase the appropriation by 229,500. \nSPEAKER_00:  $21 in the Tideline's Operating Fund Group. \nSPEAKER_00:  in the fire department to restore the Marine State, the officer position, excuse me. \nSPEAKER_00:  As a result, not included in this proposed upgrade of Clark type is three to an assistant administrative analyst position and restore the reduction of the non-career lifeguard staffing, which was proposed to go from 20.83% to 20.83% of the non-career lifeguard staffing. \nSPEAKER_00:  FTEs to 18.75 FTEs. This will be funded with Tylin's operating fund, reserves as needed, including the review of a Marine Safety Operations as part of a comprehensive study of the Fire Department in FY21. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion L. \nSPEAKER_00:  is to request the city manager to pursue. \nSPEAKER_00:  Potential waivers. \nSPEAKER_00:  from some requirements of the safer grant, specifically requiring \nSPEAKER_00:  regarding the maintenance of our effort provision and the \nSPEAKER_00:  Grant period timeframe that currently make it prohibitive from a financial and budgetary viewpoint to accept the grant. Staff should report back to the City Council during FY21 with a status update. \nSPEAKER_00:  and bear with me. \nSPEAKER_00:  En de moois in IEM. \nSPEAKER_00:  is to request the city manager to study and report back to the city council during FY21 on options. \nSPEAKER_00:  for restructuring library services, including the potential of expanding library hours at some locations. \nSPEAKER_00:  Studies should include usage. \nSPEAKER_00:  Statistics. \nSPEAKER_00:  Building conditions, changing usage of library facilities. \nSPEAKER_00:  and other factors appropriate for decision making or future changes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion in is to request the city manager to study and report back to the city council during FY21 on potential organizational changes that will reduce costs for FY22 with the least impact on services and ability to manage and control operations and finances. \nSPEAKER_00:  motje ?? \nSPEAKER_00:  The motion is to request the city manager whole position is vacant, where practical and feasible. \nSPEAKER_00:  to maximize vacancy savings. \nSPEAKER_00:  in FY21 and to prepare for potential staffing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Reductions in 20 \nSPEAKER_00:  2 FY22. \nSPEAKER_00:  And the last motion is P. \nSPEAKER_00:  In total, there's a general-flung group structural impact of 470. \nSPEAKER_00:  487. \nSPEAKER_00:  $574 offset by net one time savings of $487, $574. Additionally, there is Thailand operating fund group's structural impact of $292,521 to be offset by the Thailand's operational fund. \nSPEAKER_00:  Reserve as necessary. \nSPEAKER_00:  and so my colleagues. \nSPEAKER_00:  Those are the motions. \nSPEAKER_00:  recommendations from the Chair to the Budget Oversight Committee for your consideration for adoption. \nSPEAKER_00:  Nice old move. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Chair often, I'm happy to second the motion unless Councilman Rongo would like to, since this is the first year on VOC, I'm happy to. \nSPEAKER_08:  to step aside if he'd like to or I'm happy to second either way. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll go ahead and second it, but I do have a question. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hey, so good. \nSPEAKER_08:  I did too, but \nSPEAKER_00:  It's been moved the second. \nSPEAKER_08:  I need to get out of here. \nSPEAKER_00:  So, so. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Can we, we can move in second? We can move. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can. Um, \nSPEAKER_00:  Get a second on the motion and we can open it up for discussion. \nSPEAKER_00:  So which second emotion? \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll try. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, thank you, Councilmember Uranga. \nSPEAKER_00:  So with that, I'd open it up for... \nSPEAKER_00:  discussion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, if we go back to item I. \nSPEAKER_04:  I had previously asked at the last budget meeting regarding \nSPEAKER_04:  cuts to city council offices that would be \nSPEAKER_04:  In my opinion, a bit draconian in the sense that we would have to \nSPEAKER_04:  have \nSPEAKER_04:  God, that would be great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Borses. \nSPEAKER_04:  to cut staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I see that now. \nSPEAKER_04:  We. \nSPEAKER_04:  had an increase. \nSPEAKER_04:  Another percentage point from 4 to 5. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thougthyan Piawa \nSPEAKER_04:  Is there? \nSPEAKER_04:  But I'm looking for basically an opportunity to \nSPEAKER_04:  have council offices be able to give them. \nSPEAKER_04:  be able to uh \nSPEAKER_04:  make a budget that according to what they had in their budgets. \nSPEAKER_04:  some of the council offices have much more. \nSPEAKER_04:  are leeway than others. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I would hope that it could be proportional as opposed to straight across. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's my counter. \nSPEAKER_00:  Is that the comment or was that a question for staff? \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, basically, I guess it will be a question for staff. And we could do something that I don't rather than illustrate across. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Some comfortable offices are like a better in better position to make those candidates. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's where I'll turn that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I know last week we... \nSPEAKER_00:  We took those into consideration and \nSPEAKER_00:  believe there might have been some response and even in our \nSPEAKER_00:  to for a firm that you received recently from the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm gonna get lots of feedback. \nSPEAKER_00:  But as I understood the issue, it was... \nSPEAKER_00:  It was almost impossible to budget in that way because you said yourself that every office is managed a little differently. There may be some. And I think what we heard last week was that it is difficult to carry savings over from a previous year and put it into a budget in a... \nSPEAKER_08:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hello? \nSPEAKER_00:  in the current year. So that \nSPEAKER_00:  That may create a... \nSPEAKER_00:  and I'll let staff talk, speak to that as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Grace, do you have anything on that? Is that possible? Again, we want to work with the... \nSPEAKER_00:  The members. \nSPEAKER_00:  idea here. \nSPEAKER_00:  if I got it right. \nSPEAKER_07:  or \nSPEAKER_07:  Are you able to hear me? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, great. \nSPEAKER_07:  So just a couple comments for the committee to take under consideration. The recommendation, as I understand it from the BOC right now, from the draft version that you read is for structural reduction, additional structural reduction, to be taken by the elected offices. \nSPEAKER_07:  As was the discussion last week, there is a desire to carry over surplus funds from year end. That would only be a one-time action. That is something that this committee or the council can consider. It does not actually have to be tonight as well if there's some discussions on what to do with year end surplus. The issue was raised last year. That's something that can be addressed at year end when we actually know what the status of each of the districts either overages or underages are. Also in terms of doing the structural budget cuts. \nSPEAKER_07:  differently, there is a policy by. \nSPEAKER_07:  City Council to have equal budgets across the council districts. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's the equalization policy. So that would be something that the council would have to say is something different that they would want to now have council districts have different adopted, budgeted levels. So that's another point of consideration. But for the moment in terms of looking, I believe what the issue of a council member, Uronga Rae's last year was Year and Sir Plus. That's again something that could be looked at at year end in terms of how to utilize those funds. Let me know what's the status for FY20. And also the point with that would be that those are just one time funds if there is a Sir Plus. \nSPEAKER_07:  and the current recommendation is looking at structural reduction. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_00:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Mr. Chair, I just want to go ahead and \nSPEAKER_04:  on set aside with the answer given by you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let me see you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hey. \nSPEAKER_00:  I just had to follow up to that. If by chance a budget was came in under at the end of the year for one of these council offices and what it would be. \nSPEAKER_00:  They could very much go to the full council and ask for those funds to be used toward their office operations. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Correct. If it counts, currently the policy is that any year and surplus, and this is just for the account of the strip. \nSPEAKER_07:  Currently, if there is any surplus, it automatically rolls over to a council district divide by nine funding allocation, but if a council district or the council body as a whole wanted to approve the different use of those funds, including adding to a district operating budget, that could be discussed at that time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for that clarification. \nSPEAKER_00:  Any more quick questions, Council Member? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, I'll start with a response. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, thank you. Council Member Price? Vice Chair Price, sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you chair Austin. I want to \nSPEAKER_08:  I want to support the motion. I do have a couple of questions regarding some of the elements of the motion. The fireworks task force, I think that's a great idea. It's definitely something every council district has had issues and concerns with and something that we've all tried to address locally in our own districts. I'm hoping that \nSPEAKER_08:  If that is an item that's approved this evening. \nSPEAKER_08:  Searle's Vajee. \nSPEAKER_08:  option that that \nSPEAKER_08:  There's a lot of local efforts in the different districts, including the third district with the fireworks task force that I would love for them to be incorporated into whatever structure we give to this task force in terms of stakeholder feedback. \nSPEAKER_00:  So you're saying that you'd like to see some community stakeholder involvement in that process. \nSPEAKER_00:  You can't do it. You can't do it. \nSPEAKER_08:  \ub0a0\uc528\uc600\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \nSPEAKER_08:  You could discuss. \nSPEAKER_00:  You're cutting in and out. This is difficult. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  to do. \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilmember you. I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, you're cutting in and out. So it's kind of difficult to understand. \nSPEAKER_00:  What exactly? I think I heard that you'd like to see \nSPEAKER_00:  some community. \nSPEAKER_00:  stakeholder participation. \nSPEAKER_00:  in the task force working with the city's team. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice-tier. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice to your price are you with us? \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm with you. Can you not? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, we have an energy in about a minute and a half. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, my apologies. I can't hear you fine. I'm not sure what's happening. I'm parked right outside of City Hall. But what I was saying is that if this item is to be approved by the council tonight as part of the budget recommendations, then I would hope that we can come back. We can have a comeback by staff so that we can give it some structure and a framework to make sure that the different stakeholders throughout the city who have already been engaged in this conversation have input into the process moving forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  That makes sense to me. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. The other thing that I wanted to. \nSPEAKER_08:  to say is the restoration to the lifeguard and junior lifeguard programs. I think those are critical. And I'm hoping that once we get beyond this year, there's a lot more creativity brought to the table in terms of how we can \nSPEAKER_08:  do the programs and staff are beaches in a way that creative and understanding our budget shortfalls because the taisan's budget is going to be hit pretty dramatically over the course of the next few years and I want to make sure that we are looking long-term and not just in survival mode or reactionary to the year but that we're looking long-term for the future so with that I'm happy to support the recommendation tonight understanding that we're going to have to get creative for next year. \nSPEAKER_00:  I really know it and I do appreciate all of your input on those items to help us get to this recommendation this evening. With that said, we've heard from the public, we've heard from behind the rail, you've heard my motion. \nSPEAKER_00:  Let's go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_05:  Council Member Joronga. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Best Chair Price. \nSPEAKER_05:  Chair Austin. All right. Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as I believe concludes our budget oversight committee meeting, these recommendations will be forwarded to the City Council. I'm discussed during a budget hearing during our City Council and \nSPEAKER_00:  I just again want to thank everybody for your indulgence and participation. \nSPEAKER_00:  and great collegiality. \nSPEAKER_00:  that he's very difficult times right now, based on our city, but I believe that this recommendation and the budget recommendations that we just passed, that will propose by the city manager and mayor, will get us through. \nSPEAKER_00:  an operational year in FY21 that has minimal impact. \nSPEAKER_00:  on our"
