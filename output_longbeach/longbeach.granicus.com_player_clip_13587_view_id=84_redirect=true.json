However, due to state legislation, the ADU is deemed approved as it has been over 61 days since application. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hence, it is under CHC's \nSPEAKER_03:  for review and consideration. \nSPEAKER_03:  The property is located at 3-039 East 1st Street with the coastal zone in the Bluff Park Historic District. And in the two family residential district with large lots, zoning district. It is a contributor to the Bluff Park Historic District District 2. \nSPEAKER_13:  plan or illegal sand of all will make the presentation soon. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. Thank you, Vice Chair and members of the Cultural Heritage Commission. Before you, this evening is a certificate of appropriateness. 464 square foot addition to the rear of the first and second floor of an existing 3,400 and 8 square foot two-story residence. As previously mentioned, the property is located in the Bluff Park Historic District. It is in the coastal zone and it is also in the R2L zone. \nSPEAKER_10:  The project site is a fence of 8,250 square foot parcel. It's at the center of the 3000 block of East Fierce Street. This is between Orizawa Avenue and Paloma Avenue. \nSPEAKER_10:  the parcel has access from East First Street and also access from the alleyway in the rear, East Dodgeway. \nSPEAKER_10:  The site is located within the Bluff Parkesort District again in the Corseson and in the R2 L zone. And it also carries a general plan, land use, playstyle of founding and contemporary neighborhood, two stories. \nSPEAKER_10:  surrounding uses include single-family residential to the south, to the east and to the west, and in the middle of north you would find some multi-family residential. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide provides a street view of the existing two-story residence with the attached portocachear. This view is from East First Street. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide will provide you some views of the rear of the residents. The pictures are provided by the applicant. The picture on the left shows the existing patio cover that would be removed to accommodate the proposed addition. The picture in the center shows the resident's rear access to. \nSPEAKER_10:  to the backyard and it also shows the windows and also exterior access from that family room. \nSPEAKER_10:  And then the picture on the right shows the rear of the existing family room. \nSPEAKER_10:  please find the site plan of the existing two-store residence on this slide. The two-store residence totaled 3,408 square feet in size, 2,090 square feet on the ground floor, and 1,318 square feet on the second. \nSPEAKER_10:  On the eastern side of the residence, you will find an attach port of Kashir. It's roughly 200 square feet and the attach trellis or patio cover estimated at around 300 square feet. \nSPEAKER_10:  The detached garage with access from the alloy totals 1110 square feet. On the ground floor of that garage it's 555 square feet and there's a second story loft above that of the same size. \nSPEAKER_10:  The proposed project includes an interior remodel of the existing residents to create a bedroom, a pantry and a game table area. \nSPEAKER_10:  For the more of the attached patio or the attached trellis, as you say, will be removed to accommodate the addition to the kitchen and the foyer. The portico share what remain as is and the ground floor addition is not visible from the public right away. \nSPEAKER_10:  on the existing second floor. The proposed project includes an interior remodel of the existing master bathroom, closet and office area to incorporate the 330 square foot addition. \nSPEAKER_10:  The addition would allow for a new master bathroom, a larger office, and a new laundry room. The proposed second floor addition is also to the rear of the residence, not visible from the public right away. \nSPEAKER_10:  Please find the existing southern elevation on this slide. \nSPEAKER_10:  The existing residence stands at 28 feet 8 inches tall to the height of the bridge point of the existing hip roof With additional roof pitches at 23 feet 1.5 inch This is over the existing second star bedroom and then 14 feet 1 inch over the existing portica share \nSPEAKER_10:  The exterior sighting is composed of wood shingles. You will find hung casemen and fixed windows, all grid pattern along this elevation. \nSPEAKER_10:  The proposed southern elevation remains largely the same. However, the proposal includes a new roof roof ridge at 25 feet 5 inches. The proposed roof ridge will be visible from the public right away. But to remain consistent with the bluff, park is sort of district ordinance and design lines that condition there has been condition of approval included to ensure that new additions are not taller than assisting roof lines. \nSPEAKER_10:  Find the existing Western elevation on this slide. A staff highlighted features that are likely to be removed for this proposed edition. \nSPEAKER_10:  So you can see the fireplace to the existing family room will be removed and that room area behind the primary front facade of \nSPEAKER_10:  of the second floor. \nSPEAKER_10:  This slide shows a proposed second floor addition. This proposed addition incorporates different shake patterns to the wood siding and uses trim board lines to distinguish the new addition from the existing residents. \nSPEAKER_10:  On this side you will see the eastern elevations. Again highlighting that roof line and the fireplace will be removed. But also including that trellis that is going to be removed also. \nSPEAKER_10:  The proposed edition continues to distinguish the proposed edition from the existing residents, but also incorporates windows, styles and patterns consisting with the rest of the house. A condition of approval has been included to ensure that new windows are architecturally compatible to the existing wood windows with grid patterns. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  please find the existing northern elevations on this slide. Again, we highlighted that roof line and that fireplace that are going to be removed. \nSPEAKER_10:  and on this slide you will find the northern, the proposed northern elevations um to the rear of the property. \nSPEAKER_10:  The applicant has provided a line of site diagram that showcases the visual impact of the proposed roof ridge. That's that roof ridge at 25 foot 5 inches. This is a visual impact on the public right away. \nSPEAKER_10:  public hearing notices were distributed and posted in accordance with the zoning code. Staff received public comment from the Bluff Park neighborhood association Monday, February 27th. Their correspondents was attached to the agenda. \nSPEAKER_10:  This project is exam from SQL. \nSPEAKER_10:  Secret Review Per Section 15301 existing facilities as a project is less than 50% of the existing forri. \nSPEAKER_10:  As condition, the proposed project has been found to be in compliance with the zoning code. The Secretary and Interior Standards for Rehabilitation. \nSPEAKER_10:  of Park Historic District, Ordered in C-6-835. \nSPEAKER_10:  love park historic design guidelines and certificate of appropriateness findings. \nSPEAKER_10:  As indicated in the provided findings, staff finds the proposed project to be in conformance with the adopted goals and policies of the general plan. Staff recommends approval of a certificate of appropriateness to allow a two-story 464-square-foot addition to the existing 3,408-square-foot two-story residents subject to the conditions that were approved. \nSPEAKER_10:  And with that, I would like to let you know that representatives from Janet Architects are available for any questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Mr. Sanable. \nSPEAKER_09:  At this time, would the applicant like to address the project at hand? \nSPEAKER_09:  If you could state your name and address please. \nSPEAKER_12:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_12:  Good evening commissioners. My name is Jeff Jeanette with Jeanette Architects and Lead Architect on Project. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  He Leo, thank you for the nice concise. \nSPEAKER_12:  explanation and summary that was well done. \nSPEAKER_12:  As he mentioned, the project is kind of a more or less a minor. \nSPEAKER_12:  Addition \nSPEAKER_12:  to the second floor and first floor. \nSPEAKER_12:  We're trying very difficult, very hard to nestle some needs into the home itself and provide better use and better function of the home for the home owners themselves. So what we've created is a design. \nSPEAKER_12:  that for the most part respects the overall style of the home, bringing in the specific materials and considering all roof lines and everything associated with the existing home and enhancing the design itself. There are two \nSPEAKER_12:  to conditions that I'd like to talk about. \nSPEAKER_12:  Number one is number 14. This is with respect to the roof that is over the bathroom. \nSPEAKER_12:  And Ehelio, is that done? Can you pull up the slide? I think it would be the West, proposed West. \nSPEAKER_12:  That one's good. Okay. In this slide, there's been some concerns and what I'm trying to do here is address some of the concerns that have come up in some dialogue and specifically correct them. This one in red demonstrates the new roof that's sitting over the \nSPEAKER_12:  the new bathroom that will be adding on the second floor. The difference in height is listed in a letter from the \nSPEAKER_12:  local neighborhood group has been upwards of five feet in difference. It's actually not. It's close to three feet two, I'm sorry two feet two in difference and in the slide that Ilihii mentioned with the sight lines. What that equates to across the street is about a between a inch and a half and four inch visual. \nSPEAKER_12:  because of how far back that second roof is. So virtually, you're not going to be seeing anything from a roof standpoint. We looked at several different options. I'd like to bring that up. One was to lay the roof down with a slider pitch, which would effectively hide it from behind the existing roof line as shown. \nSPEAKER_12:  The outcome was inappropriate for the overall look and feel of the home relative to other roof lines nearby. And it architecturally felt very out of place to set that for up to four inch concern. \nSPEAKER_12:  The other option that we considered was to make that a flat roof. \nSPEAKER_12:  The home has a flat roof in the rear Family room area trying to bring some of those concepts in And again not appropriate from a design standpoint and in the end it really looked out of place so we Carefully examine the options and in doing so determined that this four inches from 60 80 feet away With the roof colors being similar You really won't have any effect in noticing the the roof height there everything is really gonna blend in \nSPEAKER_12:  In elevation with the plans that we have provided, you see that difference in red. However, nobody ever sees an elevation. So in reality, unless you were driving around in the double-decker bus, that would be about the only time that you would have any effect on that condition. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  So. \nSPEAKER_12:  with that in mind. \nSPEAKER_12:  We would respectfully like to strike condition 14. \nSPEAKER_12:  hopefully get that to come off of the request. \nSPEAKER_12:  On top of that, I was looking very closely at the guidelines as we do from a design standpoint. The Bluff Park historic guidelines state rear additions should not be taller than the existing roof line. That is the extent of the request in the guidelines. In our case, it does not state renew roofs shall not be seen put from the public right of way. So in this instance, that 4 inches is very insignificant from that standpoint. And, it actually feels that it does meet the guidelines themselves. \nSPEAKER_12:  And the second. \nSPEAKER_12:  condition that we would like to address is number 16, which is noted for removal of the \nSPEAKER_12:  trellis. It had been mentioned that there was not any or there were no permits associated with that. Online records do show permit. I'm happy to hand this to anybody if they need it. We do have a permit listed in 1977 for the installation of that structure. So I think it's a reasonable request to \nSPEAKER_12:  Have that. \nSPEAKER_12:  conditions removed from the \nSPEAKER_12:  Let's see if they. \nSPEAKER_12:  Are there any questions I might be able to answer for you guys? \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry, I got feedback there. Commissioner Grasovie, question for you. Did \nSPEAKER_00:  Come here. \nSPEAKER_02:  Does the ground elevation of the site accurately reflect what's there, or is the ground higher or lower than? \nSPEAKER_02:  then what's shown in your roof, your sidelined diagram. \nSPEAKER_12:  senator \nSPEAKER_12:  That is accurate. That's accurate. Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's accurate. And how did you get that? \nSPEAKER_12:  extrapolating it from out in the field, taking a look at it. It wasn't laser or anything like that. Okay. But based off of the conditions visually inspected. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  God, it got it. So you went across the street, took a look and said, okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  across the \nSPEAKER_12:  Yeah, to the chest of our abilities, that's pretty tight. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  And the sight line is actually taken from 5.5 foot. So roughly a 6 foot person. Hi, to you. Yeah, right. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  somebody. Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Mark. \nSPEAKER_09:  Anyone else in the commission? \nSPEAKER_09:  Amy, please. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hi Commissioner Bowdack here. Could I ask you to go back to the demolition slide with the yellow and then the red slide? \nSPEAKER_07:  particularly from across the street. \nSPEAKER_07:  So go forward to slides please. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So the staff report says that a second story edition can be visible. Is that accurate? \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm looking at the analysis on page three. \nSPEAKER_07:  the second paragraph of the analysis. So this would be a second story edition can be visible from the right of way. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_13:  I think just to clarify, I think what we were looking at is that \nSPEAKER_13:  probably should have said that it was visible in the proposed elevation. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we have an existing condition where there is a second story edition that's visible. \nSPEAKER_07:  and then they're proposed. \nSPEAKER_07:  condition would have two roof lines visible. Is that accurate? Could you go one slide forward? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So this is for the architect is that an accurate height for the new roof line at 255. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, it is. Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Grasovsky, I have a question for staff. So Mr. Jeanette was indicating that I think if I understood correctly that the rule is that the it can't be taller. The new addition can't be taller than the existing home. And clearly in this diagram it's not. \nSPEAKER_02:  What is your response? \nSPEAKER_13:  to that. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Sure, so I can just add to that. So the design guidelines for this particular district or historic district, the block park neighborhood historic districts. \nSPEAKER_13:  The design guidelines, and I can just pull this up here. There is a particular section that addresses how to treat rear additions to existing district properties. That section reads the addition should not develop or be larger overall in the existing building and should be no wider than the existing footprint. The key part here is a second sentence that starts. Rear additions should not be taller than the existing roof line. So as a matter of practice, what our department has done is is anytime we have a project like this where there is a proposed roof line that's higher than what's there now. We recommend that that roof line gets lower to be behind the existing roof line. So in this case, that's one of the conditions that we've added. So that area there in red, which is the new proposed roof line. What we're recommending is that that be dropped down to a lower height to match that side, not a gable that extends right in front of it. \nSPEAKER_06:  And just to add to that a little bit, everything Alejandra shared is correct, but these guidelines are in place to help us in implementing Secretary of Interior Standards and best practices around minimizing those views from the public right of way. And that's why you hear language like should. You know, it's policy guidance where we're doing our best to minimize. So that's where staff came with the recommended condition to try to reduce that. And then what you're also hearing from the applicant is their challenge in making that feasible and possible. So these are all things for the commission to consider in your deliberations. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Are there any other comments from the commissioners? \nSPEAKER_07:  If I may, could I see an elevation on the \nSPEAKER_07:  I guess the east side. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  also just one remind the commissioners that there was one letter written regarding this project. Specifically about the height. \nSPEAKER_09:  at this time. Is there any other discussion before we call for a vote? \nSPEAKER_08:  Please leave a comment. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Mr. Jeanette, at this time. You could also, if there's something that comes up, you can address the commission at that time. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_09:  You know the routine, name and address please. \nSPEAKER_00:  My name is Louise Ivers. I live at 1837 East 6th Street. I'm the vice president for advocacy for Long Beach Heritage. We have a concern about that roof line. The project in general looks really good, but the idea that you're going to be able to see a roof sticking up. \nSPEAKER_00:  from the addition from the street is not a good idea and we support staff \nSPEAKER_00:  and their contention that the roof lines should be lowered. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Miss Iris. \nSPEAKER_09:  Is there anyone else from the public that would like to address this particular project? \nSPEAKER_05:  For those of you joining us virtually, if you would like to make public comment on this item, please use the raise hand function at this time. The first person with their hand raised is Marco. Marco, you have been unmuted. \nSPEAKER_05:  You have three minutes to make public comment. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. Good evening commissioners. My name is Mark O'Pizzo. I live in the Bluff Park historic district. I also am a board member of the VP of events and fundraising for the Bluff Park Neighborhood Association and I was honored to be able to sit in on the presentation from Jeanette architects to better understand the project. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I do support staff's recommendation of lowering that second, the second Reflign that is taller than that first Reflign and primarily I know who \nSPEAKER_11:  When we met with Jeff, he said, you won't see it from the street. I appreciate he's done a section, but honestly, I live around the corner from this property. I walk on the other side of the street with my dog every morning. \nSPEAKER_11:  and you can see that roof line. It is pretty \nSPEAKER_11:  pretty flat in the way you look at that house because it's the whole width of that property. \nSPEAKER_11:  and you do see and I believe you will see that roofline two feet taller behind so I just want to point that out \nSPEAKER_11:  It just seems pretty obvious that based on the guidelines and the information. \nSPEAKER_11:  in the condition that that should be looked at. \nSPEAKER_11:  be lowered and be behind the existing roof. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Anyone else from the public? \nSPEAKER_05:  Our next person with their hand raised is Jeff. Jeff, you've been unmuted. You have three minutes to make public comment at this time. \nSPEAKER_01:  My name is Jeff Malin. I am the president of the Bluff Park Neighborhood Association. I'm sorry, I can't be there in person with you. But I too want to echo the previous speakers. And first of all, thanking the architect for meeting with us and providing the plans a couple of weeks ago, a few weeks ago. But we also want to give a big shout out and thank you to staff for the excellent written, well-researched analysis and recommendations. We do support this project with the special conditions, especially the special condition to reduce the height of the building. But all of we agree with this, that report in total. After meeting with the architect, we discussed several different things and they were good about addressing the differentiation of new versus old construction or the past construction. So we appreciate that. But they did express concerns about reducing the roof line. Now knowing that it is only about two feet less, we feel that it is even more justification to keep to this staff's recommendation to lower the roof line had or below the point of that roof line in front of it. We also feel like doing anything less would set the wrong precedent would not be sensitive to the ordinance and the design guidelines. The design guidelines do talk about regardless of, as Alejandro voted, regardless of the visibility piece, although that may be a driving factor, it does say the new roof line should be less than the, and Allison's right to, it says should, but it should be less than the existing roof line. So we believe that if it is approved as it is, it will detract from the home's original front elevation. It's beautiful roof lines and curves and the shingle nature of the building. We do really appreciate staff's report analysis and the special conditions and ask that the commission approve this property with all the conditions as articulated by the staff. Thank you for this opportunity and I speak today on behalf of the Blood Part Neighborhood Association. I don't know if I introduce myself, but I'll say at the end, my name is Jeff Malin and I'm the president of both Part Neighborhood Association, living around the corner, as visualized in the photo that you guys showed the aerial view. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  is there anyone else from the public that would like to address this? \nSPEAKER_05:  Once again, if there's anyone joining us virtually, that would like to make public comment on this item, please use the raise hand function at this time. \nSPEAKER_05:  There appears to be, you know, further public comment. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Also, I'd like to bring up that the Love Park Neighborhood Association did address this project. And in the latter, they did have a concern about the notification that they were only just a few weeks before the hearing. And again, it could have been a hindsight, we don't know, but that's important that the neighbors do get notified in advance so that they can research and address any of their concerns with the architect, as well as the applicant. The other issue that has come up is the ADU and because of the 60-day window that is now has passed, we cannot comment on that. And again, it's unfortunate that these projects are coming in front of us with our hands tied. So it's important that we do act on that in a more reasonable manner. And again, this is the second item that is under this 60-day window that we had had no say over the matter. So something that we want to look at in the future. At this time, is there any other commissioners that would like to address this project before I call for a motion to vote? \nSPEAKER_09:  Can we show your body? \nSPEAKER_07:  High Commissioner Bodeck here. I have a question for staff about the removal of the lattice and whether you had seen a copy of that building permit. And what your position is on that condition of approval. \nSPEAKER_13:  Sure. This is Alejandro. I can speak to that. So yeah, I think there is and I don't know if we have this in the PowerPoint presentation where we see the lattice. Okay. So there is some lattice that and we can probably pass this around the commission if you want to just pass it. \nSPEAKER_13:  There is some lattice in the side yard area that we were looking at. It's not clear in the permits where that proposed lattice was supposed to be. We're not sure if that is something that was, because there's also a covered deck in the back. So we're not clear which one it is. What we can do is to address what the applicant had raised about that is, we can do a follow-up and just clarify to see if that permit pertained to that lattice in the side yard. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, I would say it's a little unsightly. It should probably be a nicer lattice if it is in fact permitted. It might just need to be spruced up a little bit. So I am of the position that that condition should remain, but ask staff to follow up on it to verify the validity of that building permit. \nSPEAKER_07:  in which case it would go away. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do want to go back and look at that East elevation again. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  Ask the architect if he had shared the proposed roof lines with staff that you had proposed to resolve that condition and lower the roof line. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you, Commissioner Bodeck. We did those internally from a design standpoint, just schematic design, meddling around different concepts to see what opportunities there were. And in both cases, the flat roof just didn't work well at all. The pitch roof, dropping the pitch, affects the Eve lines. As soon as the roof lowers, now my Eve raises. And it doesn't allow us to tie in a nice clean Eve line from the back all the way around. \nSPEAKER_12:  Truthfully, it ends up kind of botching the e-condition all the way through. So that definitely didn't sit right architecturally for us. \nSPEAKER_07:  So are you tying into the ease of the main proof line? \nSPEAKER_12:  It's consistent. It rolls around the other side. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_12:  It comes in at a fireplace on the... \nSPEAKER_12:  other side where we're trying to keep a consistency through and through. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_12:  Can you go to the opposite slide, please? \nSPEAKER_12:  Oh, does this work? \nSPEAKER_08:  You've got the power now. \nSPEAKER_12:  Got it. \nSPEAKER_12:  Right. Here we go. \nSPEAKER_12:  you can't feed in there. \nSPEAKER_12:  I can't see it on the screen, but essentially the existing \nSPEAKER_12:  white to red is that Eve line that continues through and through. And if we change it at this, \nSPEAKER_12:  one spot as we drop that roof line by two feet. \nSPEAKER_12:  it's not going to be consistent through and through. \nSPEAKER_12:  There's just no way to do that. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  physically. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_12:  from the design standpoint, it's just off. \nSPEAKER_12:  And I mean, if I could just remind you that we're talking like three to four inches from across the street. If you're walking your dog, you're walking your dog, you're not. \nSPEAKER_12:  focusing your attention on this sliver of roof that you might see as you're walking by. I just have a hard time that this is so obvious to everybody that it's concerning. I respect the \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  the thoughts behind it completely, but at the same time I think there's a point at which we need to look at the reality of it too. \nSPEAKER_09:  Are there any other questions? Do you like to address the architect at this time? \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Grassoffey. So you guys tried flat, a flat roof, you tried dropping the pitch. Did you try it? And I know it's not the style of the house, but did you try some kind of radius for that roof? No. \nSPEAKER_02:  I know it doesn't. Not for the style of the house. But it's not for something that you may not see from the... Like you wouldn't probably see it from the side and you definitely wouldn't see it from the... \nSPEAKER_12:  I know it doesn't. That's for the style of the house. But it's not. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  from the front. \nSPEAKER_12:  No, we didn't explore that. I'm just, to me, it would be too outside the style of the home. And I think that would be... \nSPEAKER_02:  Zu ship cast \nSPEAKER_12:  I would be concerned that the neighborhood association would have even more concerns with that versus \nSPEAKER_02:  It sounds like their main concern is being able to see it at all. Right, and see it. \nSPEAKER_12:  great. \nSPEAKER_12:  the four inches that you could potentially see from across the street is the content which I completely respect. Right. But here we are trying to add a little bit to the home. The guidelines say it can't go higher than the existing roof. It's significantly less by three foot three than the existing roof line. So you guys don't say that I can't. \nSPEAKER_02:  What's the pitch on this one on that on that back roof? Can is there a way you can fight it and just, you know, is it like, is that six and twelve? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  6 and 12 is that roof line. That's correct and we're matching those around it. \nSPEAKER_12:  and we've actually \nSPEAKER_02:  I mean it's almost like if he... \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  dropped it down half an inch or an inch per foot. \nSPEAKER_02:  You might be able to swing that. I know it doesn't match up visually with the main roof. \nSPEAKER_12:  Understood. Yeah, I mean I look at this and say what's the lesser of evils right I'm happy to \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. \nSPEAKER_12:  come to \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm happy medium, that's for sure. If you guys are okay. \nSPEAKER_12:  having a roof line and a gable right next to another gable that is inconsistent. Sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  What you already have all kinds of different pitches on these roofs. \nSPEAKER_12:  They're all between five and a half and six for the most part. Yeah. So we are dealing with existing conditions, trying our best from a design standpoint to get that to work for sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right. \nSPEAKER_02:  I just wonder if that half inch per foot might do it for you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Yes, it could potentially do that for sure. And I'm happy to explore that from a conditional standpoint and say, yeah, if this works and staff is happy with it and it meets the concerns of yourself, we could continue with that, that's for sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_12:  Dropping it by two feet though I think is \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know. \nSPEAKER_02:  like for me anyway I'd be okay with if it could just drop that four inches you know visually \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02: ERS \nSPEAKER_02:  So I don't think the two feet is going to happen. \nSPEAKER_12:  Ray. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, if we're- That's because then you start going. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  It's \nSPEAKER_02:  If you have any questions, please leave a comment. \nSPEAKER_12:  It becomes too different. Completely. Yeah. That's our concern architecturally as well. From a design standpoint. But if, you know, from the line of sight study that we did, taking it down so that that 4 inches is unseen, you know, sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Sure. \nSPEAKER_09:  Are there any other questions or comments from the Commission? If none, I would like to entertain a motion regarding approval of this project 23-003. \nSPEAKER_09:  Come to your body. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'd like to move this project with, and I'm not sure how to word this, but with a condition related to, I believe it was condition 14, the condition of approval for 14, that the architect explore an option. \nSPEAKER_07:  that would allow that reduction of that four inches that's visible from the right away across the street. \nSPEAKER_07:  Present that to staff and if that is acceptable to staff go with that option. If it is not, then I support removing condition 14 entirely. As one who owns a house with myriad roof lines, it's incredibly difficult. \nSPEAKER_07:  to manage water flows and \nSPEAKER_07:  things like that. So keeping the roof line at the same pitch or angle would be preferable if it were below that roof line. If you can't reduce it by that 4 inches so it's not visible then I propose getting rid of condition 14 entirely. \nSPEAKER_07:  So that's an either or for the city attorney to figure out how to write. \nSPEAKER_09:  And what about condition 16? Do you want to make that in the motions? \nSPEAKER_07:  I propose to leave Condition 16 in and give staff the authority to wave that condition if the building permit was legitimate. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Commissioner Butterk. Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_08:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  Before we take the second piece we want to make sure we've got clarity over here the dius on the motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  So going in reverse order just to make sure we've got clarity. So for condition 16, if it turns out that the lattices permitted, I think I heard earlier that \nSPEAKER_06:  that we would want it to see it improved visually but could allow it. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_06:  really \nSPEAKER_07:  really if it was permitted properly, then I would suggest staff leave that condition. \nSPEAKER_06:  under said. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. And then related to condition 14, which is regarding the height of the roof line. Staff will work with the applicant to explore the feasibility of reducing the roof line by four inches in order to minimize visibility from the street. But if that does not prove feasible without having to change the roof pitches, then \nSPEAKER_06:  This condition shall be removed. The intent. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's the intent, but the clarification is that the \nSPEAKER_07:  Reduction of 4 inches is the 4 inches that is visible in the line of sight analysis from across the street. \nSPEAKER_07:  so it may or may not be a four inch height reduction. \nSPEAKER_08:  So, for clarity, it would be from that location of the analysis across the street that there is not that visibility. Correct. \nSPEAKER_07:  The intention is to \nSPEAKER_07:  reduce the visibility of that back edition. \nSPEAKER_07:  to be in line or lower than \nSPEAKER_07:  the second roof line. \nSPEAKER_07:  The second highest roof line. \nSPEAKER_07:  and the existing conditions. \nSPEAKER_08:  and the feasibility would relate to the pitch. \nSPEAKER_08:  Correct. For purposes of staffs analysis. \nSPEAKER_02:  correct. Yeah, this is a commissioner Grassoffi. I did hear somebody say without changing the pitch of the roof. I don't think that's I don't think you can accomplish both things. You can't produce the visual height and not touch the pitch. So I think he's going to explore the you know changing the pitch just slightly to make it so that visually you can't from across the street at five foot six that four inch one and a half to four inch visibility is not there anymore. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that's with an understanding of the five and a half foot to six foot pitch. \nSPEAKER_08:  Sorry, the 5 and a half to 6 pitch that was provided from the architect earlier. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, so the existing, the way he currently shows it is it's a six and 12 pitch. That may need to come down slightly to as, maybe as low as five and a half and 12 pitch. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  I just want a very clear distinction in relation to how staff can exercise the authority that you're giving them. \nSPEAKER_02:  how they can evaluate what we're... \nSPEAKER_08:  right for feasibility so what you provided is very helpful I believe your staff. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Mr. Jinnett, you'd like to address this issue. \nSPEAKER_12:  that we will not be reducing that roof height down to \nSPEAKER_12:  equal to or lower than the adjacent roof, which I think Commissioner Bowdeck may have. \nSPEAKER_07:  You're correct. Thank you for that. That is not the intention. \nSPEAKER_12:  you're \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  It is the intention so that it is not visible from across the street in the line of sight analysis. \nSPEAKER_07:  That is correct. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  very much. \nSPEAKER_08:  and staff are you clear on? \nSPEAKER_06:  at the staff table, yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, so we've got a clear articulation I think for purposes of the motion of the discretion that staff has to make that evaluation. And then if that evaluation proves unfeasible based on the direction provided in Commissioner Boat X motion, then condition 14 would be removed from the condition. Is that correct? Commissioner Boat X. \nSPEAKER_07:  That is correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'll be there for three and a second. Greg, Commissioner Safi will second it. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. Bye. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you, Commissioner. If there are no other discussion on this item, can we have a roll call vote please? \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Bullock. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Grasafi? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Hunter. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Ramos. \nSPEAKER_04:  Vice-Chem McWan. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  and chair Irving. \nSPEAKER_09:  Congratulations on the motion passes unanimous. \nSPEAKER_09:  And thank you, Mark. \nSPEAKER_09:  At this time we would like to move on our agenda item number 2 23-005 \nSPEAKER_03:  Recommendation to receive and file presentation presentation for Black History Month regarding the history. \nSPEAKER_03:  of discriminatory and exclusionary housing practices against black people in Long Beach and the last thing \nSPEAKER_03:  impacts today. \nSPEAKER_03:  including over-representation of black residents in the cities precariously housed and unhoused populations. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, commissioners. As I mentioned briefly earlier in the director's report, we wanted to take this time during Black History Month, first and foremost, to honor and uplift Black History here in Long Beach, including some important Black leaders historically in our city, while also taking the time to recognize the history of Black exclusion from housing in Long Beach and the lasting impacts on Black residents in Long Beach still today."
