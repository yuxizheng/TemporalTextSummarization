        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  So that commission accomplishments, so we'll flip back to when the tellers we have to vote on these for them. We have to vote on these for these great achievements. Yeah, no wait, but you can receive any questions if you're not being an accountant. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah wait. \nSPEAKER_01:  Happy. \nSPEAKER_01:  So Julian, are you, what's over our value statement? And just wanted to quickly just look up to all of us, the accomplishments of the commission. The last couple of years. \nSPEAKER_01:  2020 established a full commission and created a fair and transparent process to select the first time members of our independent research and development commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  2021, the Commission established their mission statements, their value statement, who has come up with ethics and the school leader reports the ethics portal. \nSPEAKER_01:  Our action plan and our ethics education program has been launched. And then in 2022, we got the ethics officer. We established our motto and symbol for our education program. Updated our bylaws including the Florida policy partners with the auditor on health line and the administration pending. And they put a fund it made it through meeting for process finally and document the council for approval. And we're officially qualified to generate it this year. \nSPEAKER_01:  ever \nSPEAKER_01:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_03:  \u00a1Vuelve! \nSPEAKER_01:  We can talk about it more later, but just looking ahead at 2023, we're launching the education program hopefully soon, as well as our ethics health line launch, so coincide with each other and then that the commission is working hard to get the lobbyist board's recommendation out, looking at April for that. \nSPEAKER_01:  And with that, that connection to our offer for item number one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can we make a couple covers? I don't know how far we can go. It's definitely thanks. \nSPEAKER_01:  I do because the left right, how much is the left right little while? I mean, for this particular, I would like to see like our mission statement and our values have promoted upfront, they have an experience that goes there. And then the other thing I just add to what's said about accomplishment here, this mission, I mean, for some people were at point, there was no place in the case for the epic mission particular, and I think the fact that that happened, I think, \nSPEAKER_01:  and help you work continue and grow. I think that's important. And I believe that you recognize that something that is essential to us, that the work comes to set, get a message that let me and you talk about it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  because neither fully and or in this position were allocated at the time of the start of 2020. But I think it wasn't as much as I expected. \nSPEAKER_01:  I said, that's where we're at. Although kids will work, I have to secure it with a flick. \nSPEAKER_01:  And \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Ryan. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  down until we have the first position out here. \nSPEAKER_01:  I thought Andrew was the truth. Yeah, I thought he was the truth. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. I'm meeting them. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah everything. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I know like we just kind of set those boards, but you know, we know that sure, once I represent the one, a part of work, and you know, that the reason why I put finally here when we came to meet a good first process. It took a long time, so you know, I know that in the game it was a bumpy start because we might be going and we didn't have a lot of the resources of the time, we had a virtual, we had an in-person, you know, all that mixed with different, we're busy, you know, just selecting the, the kind of different conditioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  here. \nSPEAKER_00:  I remember a commissioner who was a lot of the people involved in the video. I was randomly a little so I could show him. I know we just went through that but... \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll buy her a bunch of different number of videos to see there. \nSPEAKER_00:  No one else could be sure to help for that. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think we all know how to scream on the page. That's what we're talking about. All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  afterwards I don't want to block you there, just watch me! \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think it's pretty different. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's pretty different. Yeah, sure. I think it's okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  As you possibly could tell, you just wanted me to do this. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  You're trying to do it by yourself. We got that so I'm going to have that meet. And on hand and in the next. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  and then I come to every Friday and on the Monday, I know that's like, okay, here I come. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the robbery frame is a thousand hours, and it is getting acting so it should be an hour or more. It's not the same thing. It's amazing that the cops are laughing at you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_01: wasser. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now to get Justin's family to go's future people, and then we will ask Jesus we're going to take them. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I was at the interview. \nSPEAKER_04:  February March 2020. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  But at that point, it was, you don't feel well, stay home, right? It was very serious. So I got sick the day before my interview with you guys. \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh-huh. Good. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm so like, all the same managers on there. They never call me back. I don't think that's what we scared of. But they never put me in the middle of the couch. I know we're getting a return to trouble with this. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  But in our room, that's quite over there. \nSPEAKER_03: lie \nSPEAKER_04:  How about you? I was supposed to interview and then that didn't work out. But congratulation was everybody that you've done, you've done COVID, you know, budgets, you've done really amazing things, you've been working out for this in the shot. But how about your own and then the help that's important? So, congratulations. \nSPEAKER_03:  about you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then do it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So every time that there were a few people, they didn't count their heads, they were sick. And you know, like, we had a few problems. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  I love you guys on the monitor. \nSPEAKER_01:  on the monitor. Ciao. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't think I need it either. Try it with either one of our staff members. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We know one of the things that the vice-chairman talked about when we meet with the city council members is everyone's while they'll ask about an action plan. And we say we know it's very ambitious, but when we started there was no roadmap. Other than what the auditor has done in terms of the audit that she has done in the city. That gave us the jump in off the board. And we want to make sure that this commission goes forward as time goes on. So we see the action plan as a living, breathing document. And we're continually putting things on there as they come up knowing that the duration of the commission may never get to those. But there are ideas and concepts there for future commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  because in our couple of short years, Susan, J.P. and I will both be reading. \nSPEAKER_02:  that that will change the tenor thing. \nSPEAKER_02:  and when you have those of you who remain, you have to go on from your people on. \nSPEAKER_02:  and you three will have another two years. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't think I realized that our term was staggered. Yes. So those of us who were appointed by the elected, JP, and Susan were both appointed by the auditor. I was appointed by the mayor. Kenny was appointed by the mayor, and so was our rule of service placement. So Susan, JP and I can only serve two years for our first term. And then our second term is four years, and then we're eligible to serve again. JP, you are serving the remainder of Kenny's correct in terms. So, and I think that he's eligible for one more four-year appointment down the road. So you'll be the longest tenor here. The three of you that we appointed in 2020 next year will be having a conversation about you who wants to get a penny. It's probably about this time. And then we would be reappointing you in June or another four-year term. So you can serve eight years. I would say, years more. And it makes sense that that's how it was set up because the four that are appointed by the elected are the ones that choose the three at large. So it would never make sense for those four positions to revolve on at the same time that the at large revolve. I do have a third. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03: \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32 ai \nSPEAKER_03:  When the four of us choose the right mayor to message Auditor, the Auditor of the mayor then be appointed. \nSPEAKER_03:  at that point at time they get four years, they get two. We were there. They get two four years. This is because we were there many times that they should be trying to. And then, happy to have a situation in the town, wherever. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have a large of them selected. We have a, our major piece of all is a portion. So we have gone through the process of selecting new at large. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  That was a very good time. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. Anything else? Our mission is valued. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, can I get a motion of you? \nSPEAKER_02: icking. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I know I'm very moved. \nSPEAKER_02:  The commissioner in order to move Mr. White's second. \nSPEAKER_02:  very discretion. There's no public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, the picture is not mine, it's all. Yes, my finger. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, my color, though. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sure they have it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  We'll share people. \nSPEAKER_04:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_04: music \nSPEAKER_04: \u9577 your way \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  So we've got to just have a discussion, kind of transitioning from what we just discussed, to our upcoming annual Commission agenda item and things that will be, because there are some things that are changing, or regular discussion and other things that come up. So we can look at that one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  So on our list right now, we're standing items with our chair, vice chair, and the other one for us. I know that you see this about seeing those four or even out. Our budget discussion, those typically start in March and go through July. So we'll have a presentation, a standing and group of people on the budget talk that our 1, 700 compliance reports, group that will be resumed. Our city auditor, Ulye, broadway, sent these reports to the way that March and she is confirmed for our March meeting next month. And then our conflict of interest evaluation is better on going. So that's what we have. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right now there's a new thing else, mission to think of, that missing or we want to add, right, to the truth. Um, I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  from New York for that agenda setting meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  I do have to think on that. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then we could add our retreat to somewhere, it's beautiful. That would be good. \nSPEAKER_04:  the investigation and productionings. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that needs to go on a future agenda. We're waiting for comments. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  girl well better. You better go blah blah blah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Justice Bobe Nowadays, \nSPEAKER_03:  That's March, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  and we're going to talk about election. \nSPEAKER_03:  won'tressing my We'll join in \nSPEAKER_04:  in return \nSPEAKER_04:  If we have reviews or work plan and a regular item, we see where we are. Once in quite a few years, what we're going to do here today for the action plan, we can share the deal in the summer. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, we're just living in my school, yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  We have a, in a better way, just kind of walk through everything. I'd be a resident, even having that seven, you know, just building through it. This, the meeting, so every, you know, basically, what we're anticipating in genocopics, which is higher here, not down on the meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  and we have that, or we set 8, 1, or 2, 1, 2, and we have that. Obviously, it has to be flexible. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we could, we could, well, I don't know. \nSPEAKER_05:  you don't have to. \nSPEAKER_05:  we have \nSPEAKER_05:  and could rotate everyone somewhere in the area where time of sliding comes down. \nSPEAKER_05:  two to three months back to the event. There was a lot of things that we were around for this to give you guys a picture of what's coming out. \nSPEAKER_04:  We kept shopping. Yeah, and it was a shop. Well, that was the action plan. \nSPEAKER_05:  Nice difficult. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  was a sexual slave. \nSPEAKER_04:  because we're in adaptive stats. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  but actually both documents are good. \nSPEAKER_05:  They're working together. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can I take that for the action plan? Um, exercise one of the two key is... \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're going to priorly type what we want to see in the next year. So that will help us remember the ways you enjoy the night. \nSPEAKER_04:  This information that I always kind of pushed your talk off the phone. If you don't know, believe it. We always also can't really talk about that. Yeah, that's just wonderful. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I remember tablespoon which had a part of the scouter's \nSPEAKER_00:  and then part of our material \nSPEAKER_00:  We're going to go out and have a go into your house. Any other issues before the environment works? We're planning on creating a suite of those. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I think that's what our actions can do. Two point, there's a better chance with the action. I think we want to do everything to share it. We're not going to. So we've got to be honest with ourselves. We're not going to do this share. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  probably be good for the target today. Priority and the set. Yes, correct. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  We were very eager, we were still very eager, but we also didn't have a full understanding of some of the complexities of our city, and we were making things through the process. We hadn't really had anyone in the experience of building it, some of the opportunities \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I didn't remember that this set up for the lobby candidate here. Until I started working on the annual report. \nSPEAKER_04:  A \nSPEAKER_04:  I mean, that sounds like we've been working on it. We haven't been working on it a long time, but it's such a leading topic. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we're going to have to take it that one time to go to the bottom of the issue. So I think we're at a point now where we have a better understanding of how detailed some of this work is. And we have more realistic on. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So, I'll be inside. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, my head and I were talking about that other thing, the student of the group, behind to do that because no commissioners have, you know, good two, three years with the understanding and knowledge that we can have beforehand. So, now we know that min and confer can take almost a year. You know, we know that the important thing can be a bit of a thing. So, you know, that one form. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  We know need and can probably be a little quicker in the future because we have a very good approach to being not less than right as deep and less as very. \nSPEAKER_03:  We also like to mention one of the things when we put together the action plan. We did distinguish between when will the ethics commission finish its work versus when will we then do implementation. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's just really why I hold our own feet to the fire and I say, well, we have to be three years before it issues the gravity. \nSPEAKER_04:  as its condition will complete its work off and make a recommendation. \nSPEAKER_04:  by tuck your suspension base, and then the rapid countering that\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b's happening again? \nSPEAKER_03:  our control ofpping radio systems before the gas emissions are maintained. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think we should continue with that approach, particularly in light of what we saw within those concepts. \nSPEAKER_00:  I really invited that so it might be a tough hard day and yet a day. Yeah. So we can have some of this idea of the building to realize the equipment. That's what I'm going to do. It's nice. Thank you for the point. \nSPEAKER_03:  and get a day out. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I have to say. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Gave me the? Gotta ride first. Ah, nope \nSPEAKER_02:  Pamrespect. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you very much, Larry. We are the long classick groups, doesn't fight right? You're right. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hello, that's fine. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, well, it's like, they're from me. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I got from the department like \nSPEAKER_00:  Why do you need more of an amount to do that? \nSPEAKER_04:  But I think one of the things to clean is that people are having a lot of things. \nSPEAKER_04:  There are so many instruments you have to take out and the impact on so many different areas. \nSPEAKER_04:  Create some of that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Anything else on I would say? \nSPEAKER_04:  and have a motion to be free of five. We'll take a shot. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  sort of like uh \nSPEAKER_04:  for example, by my, who are wondering, how do we get folks from the community? \nSPEAKER_00:  just to lay this foot on this next item that we're going to discuss here. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, sorry, nonprofit specifically. How do we get that message? \nSPEAKER_04:  to give us feedback. Do we have a plan? If not, when something like this comes up, we're just going to be sure to be nice and easy. \nSPEAKER_00:  I have a lot of questions that we're not going to follow in the video. We should get there. We're going to do it on our website. We need lots of you to email. \nSPEAKER_00:  If you managed to have fun, then... \nSPEAKER_04:  So that would come in a potentially concerned community that gets out there. \nSPEAKER_02:  started in the Dakles in 116, although some of us were inside of it in Te L\u00f6s, not knowing that we can execute them like these are verylot, very \u015fekilde-friendly, but in reality the reunification of the Dakles \nSPEAKER_02:  Very well. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think the question is, because you've been told that the committee can normally do press releases in there, it's the kind of discourage from the police. I have the impression that he was discouraged from doing that with my mother's hands. So I think that's something that he's adapted on that, but I was thinking the same thing. Especially on that item, it might be good for us to kind of roll it out and see what comes back from it before it goes into the hands. I think you can have someone open discussion about what we can have that Joshua. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  ST Daf\u00fcr\u0442\u044b dad showed a stream cheering for Suf does all of you boys. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, that's something that I would like to look in with our leadership to add up to what we can do, but the chair said it's correct. \nSPEAKER_05:  wrth ni ymw wrth \u2013 iahanartbl televisione\u3057 alec f\u6177 jakim \nSPEAKER_05:  Again, this one is a more unique commission, not even because it's a charge commission, but because they're not the ones that are in the early involved. So, \nSPEAKER_05:  That's something that I work and also understand what that looks like. And we think that that is the case back from the public as well. And we would have made more sense, for example, if once we have a draft, we've shown that to many communities of the public comments on that point. Or if that's something that is left to once the best councilor, if they've got that right, or if they have the wish themselves.\u01b0\u1edfnguthetishabil work on skill, but I think they'd be possible to work on skill. Was that correct? That was a little bit of trouble, exactly what you said \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know if you talked, but that's where we're at. That's a little bit quite information. The outreach. \nSPEAKER_04:  have a good one! \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  nothing was going to be on \nSPEAKER_03:  investigation is Enjoy Yum! \nSPEAKER_03:  that you ought to have a check out. \nSPEAKER_04:  on a communication plan, just the lack of community now will forgive. One of the things we want our value statement is to increase trust in government. And by letting them communicate, by communicating to the community, their strategic submission, and either some things that we're doing, \nSPEAKER_04:  Without \nSPEAKER_03:  that could lead to him dancing rat too as if he is talking about fusing. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think you use that term, that's a broad term. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And it's, it's, it's, it's the circumstances. Just let it be. You didn't know what to do. And you had part of our mission. Right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_00:  The major role that we make is more, what the city is, more active than half the city. We're about what the city is doing, we're going to have to change the law. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this is the thing that we can talk about early on, we're doing outreach to the community and trying to bring in community members as we go from some of these health work issues. And I think the lobbying ordinance is the first one that can really touch our teeth and to that it would be good to have that community in short. So I think we're at the point where we really just know how do we do that? \nSPEAKER_05:  And the other thing, too, is you have a conversation about how to visit, basically, you know, what the reasons we have when we focus on external or internal, you know, for example, right now, because there are patients programs that have been taken off. But I would say most of what's that, you know, is not aware that we're doing that, it's not a problem. So, you know, I think you're producing internal impacts, or if we talk about it, that's just, of course, we're absolutely internal. There's a way to go. \nSPEAKER_00:  there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Also forget about last business, just to honor you and all of you.\u3089 subscribe to missed see. \nSPEAKER_04:  If it will be ready, you will be ready to have that discussion and I'm reading it two weeks. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. We'll be able to have some more. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  that, absolutely. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  It can inform our support it does not only help nosotros h basically. He really likes to be able to role. He is one of us in a session of Life. Can Justin choose permission to continue activities at the community. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we did it. And now that we have Heather, Heather has been going out with the one, if you've done one or more than one, make a good association meeting. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sure I've got one. Thank you. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm really good. Hair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  to go to some of those rakey. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we're going to talk about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  They're coming on. \nSPEAKER_01:  Any other questions in the audience? \nSPEAKER_04:  And part of our effort to queue is true. \nSPEAKER_04:  Trust in local government. \nSPEAKER_04:  And Mr. Wheeler always pointed out to try and improve the turnout eventually. If the trust made in more people will turn out to, or if they trust made in those more turnout, because they trust the measure, they're not going to be able to do all of it. \nSPEAKER_04:  If you were using two-butt world edge, you'd have to screw it. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, we're up here. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I hope so. Not all that I would just do out there is the ill-wrecked end. I don't know. \nSPEAKER_00:  So maybe after that, we're having some maybe a presentation from the Equal Native Commissioner. Like I understand how they're doing or whether maybe some opportunities for alignment and partnership. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think that maybe some opportunities I don't go on. The other area is like a team you two struggle with. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_00:  you're having a greatupa 40. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_00:  for you just a city or a few other patients and connect, you know, how can we further establish a connection between mission and state of heart as a example? \nSPEAKER_00:  At times I feel like we've only focused, we've focused and then looked at the issue and brought it after we did the development and focused on the students. \nSPEAKER_00:  Go back is over gone. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I always feel like we have to get into it. \nSPEAKER_04:  for the water department. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So they have to do their board capture adoption. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Hopefully. \nSPEAKER_04:  on their own. So it was a time time for a referral. \nSPEAKER_04:  We can just make sure that it takes on the close department as well. But there is opportunity for instance with the policy that those boards do not do without. \nSPEAKER_04:  whatever the policy is, and by certain of capital, if they have the first view, they can have to adopt it, but the other more can, you know, over those things are possible. So. \nSPEAKER_04:  but for example at \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it's because it was kind of backward. \nSPEAKER_03:  So it is applicable to the other department. \nSPEAKER_04:  Correct. And the ticket policy there is then. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm reminded of all of you about that was adopted by resolution of the Council and applied to all of the parties in the city. So it just, it matters how all of the data is adopted. We talked about that city management regulations, high city management requirements. They typically collect you request that elected appointed and the independent department comply to the mission to the city policy. But they do have that discretion to their separate. \nSPEAKER_00:  So then I got away, but I was thinking, what can you do to further the gratitude question, so that we can keep that in mind? \nSPEAKER_00:  And it is in their way. So, it's not just we do it in an app, and I speak actually, I just don't know what it is. And we're having a pretty good time. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I hear Taylor saying that it's adopted by the state council. It's like it. \nSPEAKER_04:  It can be it. \nSPEAKER_04: \u6536\u770b \nSPEAKER_04:  So we may have to take that off so we're making our recommendation. \nSPEAKER_04:  and for gift, could we get a commissioner on the Harvard Department agenda? \nSPEAKER_04:  presentation that will be different. \nSPEAKER_04:  So you guys, you could both agree then the chair member should go speak with you. You could also do a joint meeting with other commission. I know. \nSPEAKER_04:  The equity human relations and I think the technology and innovation commission have done that. They tend to, the equity human relations commission tend to do. \nSPEAKER_04:  Delivery. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that a commission for a rate that is profitable? I think so. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're not using F now, but the economic development convention on time will do that too. \nSPEAKER_04:  So there are options if you want to reach out to those questions, how we can do it. If you want to look like it, how \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't want to reach out to them, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  So things are possible. It's whether or not you want to build those relationships. \nSPEAKER_04:  rob of it? \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I enjoyed being represented as the i\u015fteist of H Dinner Barr \nSPEAKER_04:  So, which would request to contact the equity commission about a joint meeting with the fidget as the next meeting? \nSPEAKER_01:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_05:  And also, you guys know this is going on, like day to day, had their night working to communicate. So it's also helping you know, it's a new role in the program, admissions, but those were stuff they were building. You know, so they were like HR, other than public service, and it was high-firing harbor. So I think with time, you'll see a, you know, naturally and more. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  clear partnership. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I think we need to have that partnership that's set, and then also what I would mention, the administration. And then I think what we do is make that proposal and what's kind of clear and that's a joint topic. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the issues that's in the monument is finished. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, sir, that's a compliment. It's OK now. \nSPEAKER_02: -----------------------------8c847bbranddb \nSPEAKER_02:  How does north of Gerhardow receive the great aid waste? \nSPEAKER_04:  and I felt he had to take that over to the state, after the court came over. I think he's the one right now. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's perfect. \nSPEAKER_02:  a person you're seeing for the future future were sort of behind me a positive at the problem and I'm going to put that over batteries. So just a few words. The satisfaction that seems able to help your speakers. So \uc120\ubc30\ubbf8 thank you for all the best of attention and your attitude to the monitoring and the \nSPEAKER_04:  of the political terrorism. You will be at least fairness, HR, especially in procurement, success, growth, it's low. It is the overarching, the mother policy we need. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a lot of they are, but other things that touch on things. \nSPEAKER_02:  but nothing that says everybody has to describe being creative, completely. So that's where I look for it. Because I think when you get that, there's a march. \nSPEAKER_02:  or an equity goal to be so excited about that day. So that is the major. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's how it's going out, it's going out, it's going to be. I think it works with time to let this happen. Okay. I don't think much of it. They didn't follow what the light could have. The critical news was the common sense. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's about this yellow in the water. Yeah. And so, I'm especially, you know, right now, it's almost made to be like this. It's going to be like this. It's going to be three times a person. \nSPEAKER_04:  Moody data. \nSPEAKER_04:  and that's what we have to make them. \nSPEAKER_04:  recommendations to the new folks. Taylor's net worth, all the new Leon Lectures folks. \nSPEAKER_04:  Heritage Network's all of them. \nSPEAKER_04:  The vice-chair have been in the call of them. And the message to them is pretty consistent across all three different meetings. In that they're going to be hit calls that you are going to come across. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  We're trying to address some of them as we can, but in the meantime, catch the Heather for Taylor. \nSPEAKER_04:  because you don't want to be out there on your home turning a gray line. And those two bars over are gray line one way or the other without gray lines. \nSPEAKER_04: he could be in time. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I have to say something, being the ones that have been around, they know, they \nSPEAKER_04:  They know how to work within the system. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Ms. Met was a couple of the new ones. And by and large, and that's a fact, they really appreciated the fact that Taylor came to the witness and Heather came to the witness. And especially, um, some number of Cody Ritt pointed out that she had been part of the planning before she was elected to the State Council. So the Levin Act has a really heavy impact on her going forward. There are a number of things she couldn't have to refuse. I'm going forward. So she's planning on being tied at the hip with Taylor to make sure that she didn't align. And it's as simple as that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  There is a comment that is wearing on their parts that there are things that could fit them up in the future. And they are very thankful that the city has set the processes. \nSPEAKER_04:  and table to help keep them clean as they go forward. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  loving them too. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not a very part of it, but they're not a one. \nSPEAKER_04:  Are there any other people that are just going to be on me to do it at some point in time? \nSPEAKER_04:  This isn't a one-chance deal. I mean, if something pops into your head in between the meeting, send an email to myself either in the meeting and would send a vise care off to me because the vise care keeps our parking lot of issues. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you guys, thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  You get to get to me. Oh, yeah. On the way to the fire. Right here. You go. \nSPEAKER_00:  on the way. \nSPEAKER_00:  We don't know, with that rule it can become h<|fr|> \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, and it really loved it. Well, I mean, I've been bringing a party on it. I don't necessarily really should be, but yes. We definitely did, and it's part of our title. So, for example, investigation protocol is spent on the party. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  and who has it got up theeun \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  for a while. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm great back. \nSPEAKER_04:  story, but for those who stay at home. \nSPEAKER_04:  You're right, I don't want to. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And it's completely for moving up to slowly because part of what happened was that the agenda didn't use the time of time. And they were the fact that, at that time, we're trying to keep leaning within two hours. So the information can get out by just five o'clock. \nSPEAKER_04:  If you want an object to ask for this, but if you're ready to do a second meeting like this, because something is really unique or you're on an add-on, and we need to have a working session so that you can run things by the other members. Just let have your mouth. We can easily get that set up off though. \nSPEAKER_04:  If there are milk other items that we might talk about for the agenda, we have a motion to receive a plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  a Bride of 500 evener strumball 200 fly command 9 argument \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Khrush \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  And we shall reach the eightfold Blowout pass. Let's go. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to share it with you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  So now we're on everyone's favorite topic, the Action Plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay."

Right. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  when both in\ufffd and like what they're doing. The focus on this essence is still really important and \nSPEAKER_05:  No TAICs... \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure. If not, it's going to be a dud when we roll out the code of class. We're working on that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah! \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be now. \nSPEAKER_07:  We're working on the main course right now. Right now. Next, the plumbing app. Yeah.

Next, we're going to have a... \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Have we contemplated how many in person men for the in person for that? And if you're a real man. But not yet, we have to come up. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right now, the LMS is the training mechanism. And for equity purposes, that's where most of the training will take place except for those that don't have access to computers like some of our fields. But even at that point, it will be as a department, how they, \nSPEAKER_04:  training there folks but even those that don't have access to email to your state they all will enter a room and share the time screen and show us through the LMS. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  He isn't known that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  program, you can do certain training sets are mandatory in person, not all the big training discussions, but you put the course to the other half.

Thank you, Tra. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is number 2.9. \nSPEAKER_03:  mm. 2.4 flows to tie to 4.5 \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  And I'll put it after 4.2 minutes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, yeah. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Fourth place. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  So 5.2 is 1, 2.8 is 2, 3.3 is 2. \nSPEAKER_01:  been clarified for the time. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then type of 4 is 2.4, 2.9, 4.3. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  like GETTING \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, that's how they back. Dan, this is a commission meeting hall up for you. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the idea is just to be more into giving you an idea of what everyone's thinking of today. Like, okay, this is our brain, tend to be at, and the visual and commission. And we sure there's not like, I don't know, you could say there's experience, there is numerically a few of them, but in reality, you know, pretty close. So about 2018, my doors are closed. \nSPEAKER_06:  We are. \nSPEAKER_03:  Number three. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, good to see you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, so you know, honestly it could be some way where change of vote. They really have to change that. So I think what this is kind of told us to take it for a spat, but top three are very much and are collected. And then there's somewhere on the top. Yeah, with the election. I got it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, just that fellow. \nSPEAKER_06:  A fellowboy,\u6709\u4eba, lead\u00dfen Universe for 10 sur Wakale, probably which will be the first round. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. I think this time, first of all, we've started to think about whatever areas you want to look at in the States. So I understand that I don't know if I should really never be thinking about it in the years, but what do you want to add in? \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  What is made of that? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think all of us, because we're focused on the ethics program, the planning of the city, we're not advertising our own role in the responsibility structures and so on. But, \nSPEAKER_05:  then something will always come into the new author. No, I'm not going to. \nSPEAKER_05:  and make sure that all you could add to your book. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm going to have to bar with Shayla. \nSPEAKER_00:  with do a new gel. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it was a good way to do it. Everybody got to spend some time on it. I love it. They're big. They break it. If we get away from that, we're going to have a good time. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you want, you can take that over. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can't. It's already done. I'm sorry. I'm very nervous. You do a little break. I'm sorry. I'm not. I like it. What's the last item for a foot switch? Last one is for a foot switch. I always get to avoid your urgent one of the rest. \nSPEAKER_06:  I can't. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  away. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Last but not least, thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that type44 was very similar to that, yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you like to act if we really do. That's what we do. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  that would represent a Ministry of Justice. \nSPEAKER_06:  with you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I think there's a big good first step for something like that, just for sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know I remember let me try to start it and build this to be a pride for prior or a hard blow hate through which I Appreciate it. I think that the feedback I'm seeing from this is that This is \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, I think I would say all of this is ambitious, but some of the things that got the most votes are very much not voting through today. So it should be today's focus because at the speed we've seen. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  For better or worse, it's probably going to be here the way. But that doesn't mean, unfortunately, that doesn't mean we interlate trying to get that all rolling. Things like penalty, discipline, investigation, audit, these are things that we envision ourselves being a little more proactive in the commission, being a little more proactively able to do. There's a whole lot that needs to happen before that. Budget increases our common needs. In order to get those things off the ground, we have to ask about it. What I like about it, why I wrote it, some of those, it implies a lot of things need to get done first before we can do any of those things. And I think it's a mountain type of thing. Do it really things? Charter of amendments and budget tensions, things like that. If it means we have started having to add to the appropriate people, then \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that's what I like to teach as far as feedback. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I agree. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I also think we have not acted within the committee as a discussion of whether we want those to be already. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  And we need to have that exciting grip. \nSPEAKER_03:  Totally agree, I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that's all everybody else. Mine is individually. So it might be time to go. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we need to have that that's what's going to take our structure, healing the movement on top. \nSPEAKER_01:  I want to be the idea that when we need tribal size, I think it's a little important now for many of us. We're simply retired practitioners. \nSPEAKER_04:  Hey, nice. \nSPEAKER_01:  So anything, I want to\u2014to give this important opportunity and say stay that are important. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, kind of went on the ground, but she wanted her. And that's her also, but I think I can see that. All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have a warrant and we're going to rush over out. But I would remind also on the person who is doing seeing and hearing. \nSPEAKER_01:  What's happening? What should be a fight worth worth? You know, if you see anything that is a little more urgent, the minute you hold up that post, things will happen and things can't get. Priorities change automatically, I think that's about it. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's only things we can do. If we come up with a poll, we're going to buy a vote. And we need a vote. Right? Or if it's a council. Yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Then we'll grab CEOP as of April with over two minutes brother from PPP. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  It includes this idea of advocacy and the film that takes away the work that exists in the national. There can be a whole lot of people that have been getting to see what they're about, what it is, what it is. And if somebody else can do that, look so, it's more of a budget, it's more of a budget. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  increase want to a makes you guys need seven up plus seven up add six down \nSPEAKER_07:  Thanks for my perspectives. correlations \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I thinkHAHAHA Heyyyy If at everything's narrowing You can guys need to talk to their lives with rapport with their own everybody \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I'm doing both.

You know, some of our truckers are horrible. You know, we're surprised. You know, I just realized that the job not necessarily is that those truckers are cool, we find them. Now we're presenting with a camera on it. If it's not perfect, it's okay. Really. Everybody wants to know what word word you have. so the second question is Impf\u8a31 the<|kk|> Championships 5 hits. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think I'll do it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I'm going to click here. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  It's later we have 400 for that. And maybe we get 100% again, Michelle will need to change that. Rather than to approve it, we can't approve beyond what I present. And maybe it's just my change of form and the modesty of my ex-reforms that I'm trying to know. I think it's a good deal. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  which would really cheer for you off. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  That would be probably one time. I think. Um, near the order. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  What is like that? I mean that's almost a top three. \nSPEAKER_03:  I mean, that's all. \nSPEAKER_03:  right there. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think that's up to you. It's vice chairman. I think that's what we have to decide among ourselves. And I think that some support is time to move on. We're putting off really establishing new ad laws until we get through the law. And I think at the time that we get through that, we kind of look at the ones that the things that are teased up that will be done by ad laws. And I think that's definitely one which goes when ad laws start having some inspection a little process on it. We might want to do working sessions so that I can all throw my data and contact that whenever it's that ad law, and then making it go back, come up with a proposal that we can take a look at. So yeah, I don't see that as being something that's going to happen. So, look at it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm looking for the process of the determined. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it's the same positive for every else and add hot pumps together and both together a recommendation for it to do so. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  and we'll talk about where we are to pick the A and what we're going to do. \nSPEAKER_00:  I order it off the sportshow. \nSPEAKER_03:  I actually probably get so, I probably get so, I probably get so, I'm going to go like, I just get so, I just get so, yeah. This is where I'm all to respond to, at least. Pardon me. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Because I think all the work that I've been doing, that experience, I have been at it for a few years. I've kind of put it in that work, I just don't use shorter than that girl. Is there a possibility, I know we don't fit for a thing, you can just go back in and go back in. But is there a possibility of us actually having a relationship? \nSPEAKER_02:  because they keep called on the street by morning and being banget experience on their website. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm trying to put in that book. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  They, in session with L.A. which is not a commission, but it's a two-step term for maybe two L.A. Exactly, correct for possible. I'll be able to have that in the future but I'm not sure if you're able to watch that. To go ahead and stand, but there are periods of extended in that for two to three decades where they're going. And also kind of have a break and I think both share it. We would have had a few more times. So, just to have a break, especially about the ethics within their students, that's not fair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to get in. \nSPEAKER_00:  and also \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  So there's that kind of athlete, your friend, instruction, and we have, is that they have a responsibility for the election, both for the title of the video election, and then they have the ethics of there's another part in there. You want to focus on one part of their organization or the entirety. So what's the point? \nSPEAKER_00:  So, did you like people who are more involved than that? They're more particular, I know they do like contracts with people that are open, they're very more on the different side of the world. We've just been around long this, I think they've been in the same place. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's Workers' Dualites Department. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  ye eyes they're gonna bef\u00f6. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know that personally I was looking at them as a cell-weather marker for how to have a good ethical program in the city. I think they have a lot of internal clean-ups. That was the third point that I made, and I don't think they'd be willing to talk about it. I only brought them up because they never had a lot of work. They have very clear intelligence. \nSPEAKER_02:  They have. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's also more about more likely unlikely, because I kind of what they would not do again are likely unlikely, and differently. And again, I'm not going to have that discussion properly. I would be. \nSPEAKER_07:  And maybe we look at it, take San Diego. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in part of what you did in the last month, when it's early, you did it in the 40s. It's early subject. So maybe we go through that a little bit more closely and tick one. So yeah, they have campaign contracts, developers, which come on, that was the big part of their problem, with developers ethics and lobbyists. And he looked at that. And in the age of the crisis, you are only to really be effective in ethics. But you look at somebody like the city of San Diego who's a little more focused in what they do. And I know we can't do hybrid meetings, but if we were wanting to do kind of a one-on-one with them, we could tag them in virtually. And then we'd all be specifically there, right? \nSPEAKER_00:  50% yes \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  who have not known yet.... \nSPEAKER_03:  That's something that we could, yeah. I thought you were the staff that people are doing hold and we have it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Excuse me, thank you for all your questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Huajita, Dad. \nSPEAKER_03:  with little red kind. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, but I'm trying to get more out, but I'm trying to get the next risk. The first interest in us was, once we can work in, you can see how the best work format is. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  The other thing that we could do to help decide if we really want to talk to them is we could have staff kind of, we could give staff some questions that we'd like to ask them and have some sense it to those staff that commissions that we've already got, how there's set up some structure on lessons to favor and if they're using differently what would they do, where do they think appropriate focuses and then we could look at what answers that come back from that and decide if we really want to have a sit down or maybe it's just a staff to cast sit down and cast on a staff and report stuff. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we could put that on our agenda. And then maybe a way to do that was to ask and sanitize everything. It's a real and a real information. But for sure, it's not something like that. I'm just concerned that public meeting was maybe more guarded out, but they were likely to attend different. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  We should go more than round. \nSPEAKER_03:  I said that's my own agreement and then you would be sanitized. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you can show why I do think I'm not going to overlap. \nSPEAKER_02:  No, I just want to look very closely at when the commission is in the... I didn't even get here, it would be curious to see what's there. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm curious about it. I don't think so much here. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, five o'clock. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't think you're going to get it. I think you've got one ticket. \nSPEAKER_03:  which is, I think, as an yon to their effective assertion, \nSPEAKER_05:  Director! Lieutenant Chief Colonel, Lieutenant Chief \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, but I also think it would be interesting as a commission, both to a commission. I think you would take the first perspective. And any questions? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, sir. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that the commission is made out of extra distance if we work in hand on this. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it's not part of the public opinion in that. All right. \nSPEAKER_03:  and with the steps that we can take to preserve \nSPEAKER_03:  For now. \nSPEAKER_03:  And this is the end of the year. So this is part of the year. One suggestion. I have to know. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, former members of the office. \nSPEAKER_03:  now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  you were packing your bag. \nSPEAKER_03:  Have that experience with the Navy. \nSPEAKER_03:  We're gonna be more candidly. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Ciao. \nSPEAKER_03:  I know we can offer some. \nSPEAKER_02:  If there isn't any work in the nation like the Association of the Post, \nSPEAKER_01:  find an medication. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, right. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, so we're going to have to find a lot of cleverness and cool. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next memories! \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think there's a hole at the corner of the bar, or something like that. \nSPEAKER_07:  a bus les \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  organization. \nSPEAKER_07:  Good work. \nSPEAKER_04:  I mean, I know. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  So the heart submission, some of the comments are what I went to. \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, we have a portion of different for how much of these would fit in pretty good. You're almost bored of that. It's one of the key things that we have enough time to do. \nSPEAKER_02:  whether you want a person who has been org dishertz and it's actively conducted and not upwards for that or google this. \nSPEAKER_03:  pressure that it'll dampen. \nSPEAKER_04:  So you can only learn a lot from that kind of exchange. \nSPEAKER_04:  you're out there. \nSPEAKER_03:  A hundred percent information we did. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  a friend of mine, a friend of mine, the L.I. Commission, and it's headed to reach out to you. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we're going to explore your policy. I think it should be very important. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm going to switch that up and add off. \nSPEAKER_02:  as well sports acrossnewsspeakres\ud558\uace0.com \nSPEAKER_03:  get off the road to have the discussion and then asking questions that would be \nSPEAKER_05:  different. What is the tamer? \nSPEAKER_05:  And they would disclose that they had to be new friends. \nSPEAKER_05:  So they did accept the higher issues, but we don't have to identify the person. No. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  No, I consider it to be a problem with this policy because the point of the context is that information is positioning with the commission. And we've published in a policy that addresses, I think, all of the members of the Ad hoc will need to report the context for more individual commissioners. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  This was a lot of shit. I mean, that's the part where we both had it. Yeah, everybody had it. The nobody would be talking to none of this. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure. The enemy with not do something I think is disclosure of the policy. \nSPEAKER_03:  get around that but I do think that \nSPEAKER_03:  It would be more of a clear to whether we reach out to this. This disclosure policy doesn't require us then to disclose each and every nuance of their opinion about this work. This work didn't work in life, it didn't like this. That's not to be a sneakier and they can just make it to inform the public generally that this context happened. And generally what topic we've got, I don't think this policy would prevent you. \nSPEAKER_03:  for somebody to disclose their records, each and every individual opinion they make about it. That's how it works. \nSPEAKER_03:  So they said that maybe help companies? They okay, you know, I have no problem with that. The most thing that I've met with the Long Beach Athletic Commission to talk about is something I have experienced in this group. Their opinions would be not subject necessarily to, you know, who's listed in the extension disclosure. And so if that helps them, \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03: ba \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_00: gue to the Father's written name on this version \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'd be like, make sure people would let you cast the filming for yourself. Oh, right. Let me name it OK. Nice. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do the \uc5c6\ub294\u0438\u0448\u044c aguash \nSPEAKER_03:  That's a good direction to pursue. \nSPEAKER_03:  to lecture on what to bring across the opportunity that lies towards inclusion in this important mission. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I can assure why. Thank you. I can assure you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03: star Place Henry. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. White. Aye.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  next item. \nSPEAKER_04:  is the f's die. \nSPEAKER_04:  and a plan for us to provide feedback. \nSPEAKER_04:  interpretations was very good that why we pronounce it all right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can take it off. \nSPEAKER_03:  THAT neighbour? \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_03:  Right now we have the exit \nSPEAKER_03:  handbook which is copy. \nSPEAKER_03:  We just want the problem to be able to stay. \nSPEAKER_03:  So fun! \nSPEAKER_03:  I think from individual commissioners in the past, we're seeing feedback of what. \nSPEAKER_03:  I see an individual you have about the edit sample. We can't take directions from here as individual. \nSPEAKER_03:  Sure. Thank you, our question. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, in Cp was done, the purpose of my office is for \nSPEAKER_03:  This document for my office is a stakeholder moving forward because when the document was created \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  There was no ethics commission. My office was just trying to keep everybody legal and ethical. \nSPEAKER_03:  What we're looking for is your input on the document and how you'd like to make it. \nSPEAKER_03:  better improve it, how you like it structure, we've received some feedback from Commissioner about \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm not mistaken. This is compliant. \nSPEAKER_03:  specific but there is a \nSPEAKER_03:  ethical mechanism of like application. \nSPEAKER_03:  that share the value. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye-bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. I guess. \nSPEAKER_02:  If I may, I'd like to push back on the first position. I see an ethics style as having two parts. One is the ethical principle, and the other is the combined rule. \nSPEAKER_02:  and they need to be integrated in some fashion. And I said two examples of those, that inspiration. \nSPEAKER_02:  That what also follows from that in my mind is that it is jointly owned by the ethics officer and the law department. Because it's the ethics officer who speaks to the ethical principle part of the ethics guide. And the law department, the attorney's office, that speaks to the rules. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think I don't know if the city has the capability to have something joyfully out but I'd like it to put out there for discussion the concept of the joint ownership because that's the whole concept at least in my mind of an ethics guy. What we have right now is very rules things. \nSPEAKER_02:  I do this at a compliance manual, not an ethics guide. And so this document appropriately was belonged to the Attorney's Office because it's rules and it's compliance and it's employer's. \nSPEAKER_02:  But what I hope the commission would be recommending is a comprehensive guide that says, yeah, here's all the rules. \nSPEAKER_02:  But, ethics is more man-brew-or-sword, and it's an ethics officer that speaks to that aspect. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hello! \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I would say to go one step further, because I always see the council of the lawyers as, you know, either advocating a certain way for advisories and basically a matter of life or the school, so I would be in it. I don't, for the ethics office, I don't think that it just broke its tactical principles, but also the compliance rules. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now you will shortly show them. Now that's not the netted city attorney office, the city attorney office is just an integral part of it there. But it's like that. I like that. I like the partnership. It was for one. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in my communication with Don, this is what she was envisioning. Then we would still be a stakeholder contributing to the legal compliance part of it. But from the feedback we're getting from you guys around, we have the ethics officer and ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  \uc548\ub155 \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm not sure if it makes sense for the document to continue to live in my office. There's all the wonderful things that you're talking about are not the business of the city. Are you okay? Right? We all do the principles and the wonderful things that Heather is going to do. \nSPEAKER_03:  what we would like before we engage in an effort to completely revamp the ethic. And what is your feedback on what you want it to look like so that there's a plan, how it's organized, the kind of content that is in there. \nSPEAKER_03:  I have some ideas for like a compliance standpoint of what to be added and change throughout the government, but I think \nSPEAKER_03:  Working with you, Greg, you're a vision and a lot bigger than that and we don't want to engage in that effort without your feedback work. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then you put more and a lot of stickers on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh no! \nSPEAKER_06:  groundbreaking phone \nSPEAKER_06:  And big guys, take my mentoring. Yeah. That's a five story. \nSPEAKER_03:  So I think there may have been some confusion among some people who thought that it was already happening because it was on the way to Canada. So they introduced a figure on it like this. We were not going to figure something that was already captured. \nSPEAKER_06:  \uc788\uc74c \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  This one! mosquitoes! it's so cute! check this one mhm \nSPEAKER_03:  I think this is the topic, even though it's in the last because of like potentially an ad hoc to formalize the thinking of how the ethics commission would like to see the experiment. I am going to talk to Dawn in the meantime. The gift limit in this table is true COVID has been updated. If I 90, I think it might be worthwhile in the meantime of adding a lean-act fortunate to it without a state. There's a couple of legal tweaks. I need her permission to make it in the meantime. And if you guys are OK with that, while we wait. \nSPEAKER_03:  because I don't know how long it might be standing on top of all the expected practice. But the sample is, it's a quite cumbersome effort. \nSPEAKER_03:  It required a lot of time. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  guard throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  Copicetic with this 390. Okay. Woo! \nSPEAKER_04:  me. \nSPEAKER_07:  And just the other people back on the commission. So in a way, we've been working on it for a while now, just to call those policies that we brought before the presentations for the char or the family. It's a closure. So the idea is that one day, this guy can really be a one-stop shop. So it's a total policy for staff. You know, right now it's not the case for what they did at the time. It's something that we're looking for you guys in the last game, like a tourist name. How, what do you want us to look like? You guys always make a chance. That the ability is really good big. So we're taking feedback on what we can do that. How does the internet, the way it's well, you know, being transparent about it. \nSPEAKER_00:  water and \nSPEAKER_07:  Although I know that in a way we've just kind of looked at the introduction to these parties that we've done over the past and have, but they're still additional. On those pieces, we can't thank the corporate down into their firm, and just the placement of the part of the secret with recommendation is static. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  This is just what I wanted to add back in there. This is going to be with the piece of the puzzle. I'm going to move it past you. Now it's time to work on it. \nSPEAKER_02:  I realized we were going to talk about Ad hoc to a little later this evening. I did send a couple of examples like the entitled Let's Just Be Use. I know I said to you guys, I have a topic to say, what was I going to say in some way, which is definitely \nSPEAKER_06:  I know. \nSPEAKER_02:  So yeah, that's... \nSPEAKER_03:  \uc800\u7684,\u6545\u4e8b \nSPEAKER_03:  and I'm sure it's more exciting. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm sure there's more examples that other members of the information will have. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_03:  There's the top of it. \nSPEAKER_03:  you can form it out. \nSPEAKER_03:  So that way, if you guys come up with an idea for a later meeting, this can be the idea for the job, you know, and it works that way. It sounds like... \nSPEAKER_03:  because \nSPEAKER_03:  Rick maybe thought that this was a large young girl. They're still in interest in providing feedback on it. So maybe we'll reflect this. \nSPEAKER_03:  But actually, here is a partner in the education program. This is a document that we can get from the employees when they're on board and then the wonderful things that Heather is doing, they can always reference this document and the education program is thoughtfulness to that. Where it's echoing the information and different formats. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye now. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Turn it on and out. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Patrick will work with your secretary. Oh, we're starting to thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  What we're going to say, I do think this is a good idea. \nSPEAKER_03:  for an ad hoc to work on. Second, to the practical matter, because the liquid in turn is the type of liquid. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, what we need to ask is, if they are all people with the skin, or people with the skin type, they have to give little tweaks to the skin age, or maybe, under the name of the city attorney, and things like that, that happens in the right, you know, with editors' amount of chances. But that doesn't happen, so the people that have a good information. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then the question for my information, is this the document that you were updating in order to address this? \nSPEAKER_05:  Let's start the conversation about housing. I think theimal \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430un's \nSPEAKER_03:  So she was getting out of it. No, she's not. What was I in the relationship? I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'd have to let this show on. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  and get there to then back room of the hambo. \nSPEAKER_03:  There is a mental portion that the information is consistent. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  There it is. \nSPEAKER_03:  That handbook focuses a little bit more on cryptic journal. \nSPEAKER_03:  operations of commission<|mr|>form 750 the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_03:  not sure if such as on the public record that making emotions, making recommendations to counsel was a progeny. \nSPEAKER_03:  I always take it. \nSPEAKER_03:  that when we were in the line board. I'm sure we did. I'm just saying that when I see this, I don't think, oh, it's in this and then that's the fact. Because I don't have that. That value framework. I don't have that table contents of index in money. As for members, I would admit that it is existed. So that I keep thinking that they take care of people like me. \nSPEAKER_04:  and Gainscture is restored. \nSPEAKER_03:  No. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are you worth this day? \nSPEAKER_03:  One thing I wrote for connection was making it a clear to myhing up from there on lights. I know, you know, I must have\u82b1 a lot of interest in that information came into school. This's a great question of my question. I open the question and I'm hopeless and custodially to defend my job just like in Utah for a test that will get a little bit back. Would you easily come up and comment on that? I believe the university party or the school would be incapable of a good support Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So they have to go from there, out after But still here. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it's great to come forward with a little bit of discussion. I hope for Shertratwell, it should provide healthy and exotic and she's so agreed. And we'll be back at Hock. \nSPEAKER_05:  I like their idea of suicide and finally, but I don't know if that can be done just for retlining or just for making it relevant to the end. \nSPEAKER_04:  but I didn't come \nSPEAKER_02:  back in your head and your head\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u7684\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\u80a5\ufffd \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Black and Sonny wouldn't be on the way we're agreeing to go.

This is fair. They talked about water, but then it's not. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Some cases, it just says, here's the rule, but it only applies to city managers office. \nSPEAKER_02:  I feel down now. \nSPEAKER_02:  what that comparable rule is for Harvard Law. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, how does this apply to any way? Yes, it is. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sorry, no, I'm just saying how did this slide, could we, we just have earlier than a slide city wide as it adopted by the city council. This wasn't adopted by the city council, so how does it apply to the wide? \nSPEAKER_04:  the \nSPEAKER_03:  And their tape is for good. So, this is a digestible version. \nSPEAKER_03:  I would say 99% of it is F-350 in state law, in a format that staff can understand. There's a small percentage of the document that also points to local policy or regulation such as F-320, while we have very low gist of match in long-range completely prohibited. So those types of minor things are also included in the document that staff have. So those identified two people's theories, state law's explanation. \nSPEAKER_04:  it's possible. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, the city manager's policy where it knows separate, that's because it's been adopted by administrative regulation of the city manager, not as an ordinance or resolution. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's more of an internal policy, but I'm an admin for the record and now I'm calling it a truly kind of show. I'm in there, I can sign up for my history. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.

We can judge that. With links to quality and week. Right now this is a word. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is a technology version, but I can try to make it more acceptable. Adding a lethal change to the content. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Technology. \nSPEAKER_03:  For Heather, I've been talking about that student education program, like, actually with the idea of where staff can find the information from the onset. So that's on our radar too. But it's definitely something that we're thinking about in one clue. Right, it only gets stuff so much good. It's good. \nSPEAKER_03:  or this way you can find it. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I was thinking, I was thinking a little bit. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Anything else on this side? \nSPEAKER_04:  here up pressure cut me? \nSPEAKER_04:  and again a motion to be speaking for. \nSPEAKER_04:  group vaccination or fever, Saturday and night Amy closed your \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_00:  I appreciate your everything I appreciate people \nSPEAKER_00:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So, our next item is a recommendation of the staff opportunities for the Commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  provide policy recommendations regarding local elections. Over the course of the last about nine months, we've had a number of discussions about things that happened in the last election cycle, and maybe we would like to at some point in time set up ad hoc to look at maybe some changes that might be made in the way elections are conducted in the city. Taylor called me this week to let me know that her office has finished doing a lot of the new nipple updates that need to take place to the code. And there really wasn't, because that's all very legalistic. There wasn't an opportunity for us to participate in that. And it should be going ahead and have this by John Wilson. And I said I wanted to keep it on so that one you were all aware of what was happening and that those things were happening, and I'll turn it over to Taylor in a minute, so she can kind of discuss some of those things. But there are still some opportunities for the city community to also be making the next minutes of the next. So where's the information for us is going to drive. Where we can have the information. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we still have the opportunity to look at some of the other areas that code happened in looked at in a long time. Our list and fit would have implemented way that went. So it's kind of an opportunity to look at the series of little G. Already done. The first thing about weather is that we want to add to that list of possible add options coming up to the road. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hey there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, so I've actually been working with for shopping and we have \nSPEAKER_03:  We actually identified a lot of things that need to come up in the media code, but I'm sure we're saying they're all legal or technical corrections because the co-hats have not dated in a long time. Also the city is in full tangles of elections anymore. The sections that were problematic, that the media in the past made put a foul play, were in full sale journalism. We don't need, it wouldn't be valuable to have a come here so you just tell me that something that we already know that needs to go. So other spaces that you could look at is \nSPEAKER_03:  We discussed it quite some time ago, but the LVU will hold a format. That will ensure our campaign contribution and reporting can just go to the report and depending on what the recommendation is from the commission, it may or may not have to be a valid initiative and go to avoid the people. If you want to update that part of the statement, just because the LVU format was initially adopted as a valid measure, there is some room for depending on what the recommendation is to do an amendment quite ordinance. So we'll have to cross that bridge when we get to it. There's an opportunity there. You could also visit what other cities are doing, more program that related to elections, as far as transparency, disclosure, those types of things. \nSPEAKER_03:  All right \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's also, at the beginning of this election, I do a good look at the \nSPEAKER_01:  The Canada set was all with the Canada date. We might want to see another look at that, which is necessarily looking at changes to the group format, but rather the education of the candidates, particularly after what we saw. \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe to see correctness when wrong, that there's already an item scheduled for later this year about the handbook for sample. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, we'll come back with a letter that George worked on and then we're going to... \nSPEAKER_00:  I think the plan right now is like kind of we have a lot of time with the informants like that. \nSPEAKER_00:  such an in it but last time the code was on the code ready we just only did the letter but I think we're going to kind of shift around a little bit to create like a technical and then again we're adding in \nSPEAKER_00:  an additional theme for how to state the relates to the regular reviewed. I want to see S \uba54\uc774\ud06c\uc5c5\u904b. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what is the wind of wind? We bring it to the first year when it needs to be at the front of the road. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  candidate for the election for the remarks. \nSPEAKER_00:  next year. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I think we're going to do that candidate workshop in November. I think we're doing everything. Yeah, because we're doing it earlier because last I did I did it with the G-In and November, the next title will be March in November. So then we can be able to do the end of the round of November. That's one like the, \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Whenever the nomination period opens, the birthday nomination period that opens definitely calls the... The... The... The... \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm going to head out to Carol's Center to speak. So we usually talk about you once in a while. So that's one. So you look like a 10-10, when you're in my audience? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  you in August, we'll bring that letter and then we'll also \nSPEAKER_00:  and Molly got the kind of like, what the, what the, what the country wears, depending on where we're at with. \nSPEAKER_01:  and celebrate this new year's game. \nSPEAKER_01:  Germany also has practice doing research in Lake Mexico but unshow\u00fasiue. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we'll switch to that point for no further careful work. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's all we convenient for here. \nSPEAKER_03:  anything else on the side. \nSPEAKER_02:  have the real public comment on motion just to risk fingers to fly out. \nSPEAKER_02:  groups Mountain City \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm going to do a bite mission, a wide second bite mission. I'm going to take it.

The only other thing I could recommend is as long as we're tackling the top three. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  So it's just a question for you from the House. Would that be too broad role responsibility for it to have the Congress just in that state in place there? OK. Can't wait. Great. I'll put it back to you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're off with the SPD. \nSPEAKER_02:  It depends on how we're bringing, like are we born in right now? No. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think we'll need to just be conscious of that when we identify the items and then form the app talk of what the work of that app talk is going to be so that it will include the context of interest policies too. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think there's a way to do it. You do it with your clothes. You don't understand. And then, I know. Yeah, make a rock. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as we discuss all these ad hoc, I wonder if there's value, including something on the ethics commission's page, as to be a brief title of the ad hoc and then so do what they're discussing because there's always these different topics. And just keeping just another effort to keep the public at times and what the commission is working on to be helpful. It should be easy to get that for a header or website at the beginning of the sugar just like make those edits constructive, glue that they're changing every month. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Great. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So that would be great. But one of the things that we talked about before you got here was really coming up with the communication plan, which that was high and high today, because when the public would have a deeper idea of what it is we're working on, I just the only thing as long as it's clear that those meetings are not open, has a public credit, it could be, you have information about the case that a report is going to come back if somebody wants to look at what it is. But we were in a talk later when our agenda was sitting about maybe putting an item on the market and that's for how we can do the communication. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Anything else on this slide? \nSPEAKER_03:  We need to take it back. I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  for school out there what you want when you get married until your home will get married before you get married. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, let's vote.
