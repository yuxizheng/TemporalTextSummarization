        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  Would you like me to read item two? Yes, please read item two. Okay. Recommendation to receive and file a report on the impacts of sewage spills. \nSPEAKER_05:  All right, this is more exciting than the motion to approve minutes, but it is really with the impacts of the rain. \nSPEAKER_05:  This past year, closing our beaches, affecting residents and visitors. I'm excited to hear more about the impacts of sewage spells, so I'm going to turn it over to Tyler Curly. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, thank you so much Chair and Committee members. Appreciate the opportunity to present today. And certainly appreciate the attention to this issue. I am by no means an expert on this, but I really appreciate all the work across an inter-departmental team to put together this memo. And I will do my best to provide an overview. And of course, answer any questions that come from the report and this presentation. So just a few things I wanted to mention at the outset, I think as three key themes that I hope come across from the report and this presentation. The first is that there's an important distinction between sewer and stormwater infrastructure. So I think that that's a really important theme in this presentation and in the report that will help us to hone in on an advocacy strategy around this issue of sewage spills. So of course, we'll get into the specifics of that, but I think it helps to frame the discussion around what we can do about this issue. The second thing is I want to emphasize Long Beach's successes in preventing sewage spills. So one of the things in the report that I think really stands out is how well Long Beach does and our utilities department does in terms of preventing sewage spills here locally. But what that means is that a lot of the challenges that we face and this is the third main theme that I want to call out is regional. We really do face challenges in terms of upstream spills that of course impact our community, our beaches. And so with your guidance and assistance, we want to figure out ways that we can help advocate more regionally to support infrastructure development and partnerships that might help us to prevent sewage spills moving forward. So those are just three things I wanted to call out at the beginning to frame some of this conversation. \nSPEAKER_00:  Just as a refresher, this started as council action, of course, with council member Duggan, pushing for staff to look into this issue, which again, I really appreciate the attention to this, and giving us an opportunity, really, to report back on the impacts of sewage spills and beach closures here in Long Beach, including a number of other items as well, like looking at what funding sources might be available for sewage and stormwater infrastructure projects that might assist with this issue. Looking at an overviewing \nSPEAKER_00:  all of the different sewage spills that have impacted Long Beach over the last five years. And then also investigating what are some of the actions that we could take moving forward, whether it's to seek reimbursement litigation for this type of issue. And then also partnerships, as I mentioned, to help our region really prevent this issue from happening. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as mentioned, again, I'm not the expert on this at all, but did bring together a team of folks across and numbered departments with the City Manager's Office, of course, City Attorney's Office, Health and Human Services, Public Works and our Utilities Department of Put Together, this report. We also met with staff as directed in the Council Action with the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, which is quite a mouthful. The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, we actually have one of our partners here, Sharon Green, who has been immensely helpful in pulling together information about how we can partner closely with the LA County Sanitation Districts, also communicated with LA County Public Works to get information and feedback on this issue and what we can do about it. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as mentioned, one of the key themes here is, I think it's important for us to distinguish between the sewage infrastructure and storm water infrastructure. So this is obviously a simplistic image, but ultimately we can think about sewage infrastructure as largely a closed system that collects and conveys waste water, whether that's from households, from businesses, and so on, and brings that to a treatment plant to be filtered. Whereas on the other side, storm water infrastructure is largely an open system, allows oftentimes outside substances, substances like rain water to flow into the ocean, from driveways, streets in the gutters, and so on, and often is not treated. So these are both very important infrastructure systems, and sometimes of course can be impacted by one another. \nSPEAKER_00:  So what does this mean? How do we actually get sewage spills and what are called sanitary sewer overflows? Ultimately, this is when untreated sewage is released into the environment in public waterways. So before the sewage is able to get to a treatment facility, we would have an overflow potentially into these open waterways. Some of the primary causes of these sewage overflows is related to the old infrastructure, lack of maintenance, sometimes poor operational procedures, or inadequate flow capacity or blockages. So this is sometimes where you'll see, due to, as the council member mentioned, excess rain events or perhaps obstacles in the infrastructure itself could lead to a blockage that then causes an overflow. And ultimately, as you all know, I mean, there's clear impacts from a health standpoint for when these sewer overflows occur, where sewage contains disease-causing pathogens and viruses that can then be transferred to people, whether through swimming and open waters, drinking the contaminated water supply, or even eating contaminated food. And this is where, of course, the beach closures come in to ensure health and public safety. So this is just kind of an overview of what are the categories in the scale of sewage spills and how these are tracked, not only regionally, but at the state level. The report outlines these four categories as really the delineation between the scale of sewage spills here in California. \nSPEAKER_00:  And category one are really the ones that we are focused on for this presentation looking at when a spill overflows into these open waters, public waterways and so on. \nSPEAKER_00:  So with that overview, again, I just want to emphasize what we're doing in Long Beach. I think that's a really important place to start. So you can understand kind of what we're up to and what we try to do to prevent sewage from entering open waterways. So if you were to look back at some of the main causes of sewer overflows, those are the main areas that our utilities department tries to work on to prevent overflows from happening. So our utilities department oversees the operation and maintenance of our sanitary sewer system here in Long Beach. They're responsible for reporting and mitigating any spills that originate within the Long Beach sewage system. And then of course, just like other jurisdictions, we do have enforcement powers to take action to prevent any discharge within the Long Beach system specifically. And then we work closely with, as I mentioned, Los Angeles County Sanitation District to convey that sewage into their wastewater treatment facilities. And you can see from some of these numbers just how massive our infrastructure is here in Long Beach and how much work goes into preventing any overflows and issues within that system by our utilities department. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this is just a visual representation of that long beach stand. \nSPEAKER_03:  We can stand back just a second. Oh, yes, sorry. I just put terms of definition. \nSPEAKER_03:  where you're seeing wastewater. Are you talking about low systems? To our ads dorm? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  No, that would be for the sewage system. Sorry about that. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_00:  And in terms of just visualizing that system as I mentioned, this is a map that shows in green just the complexity of our Long Beach sewage system and what the Utilities Department is responsible for overseeing. And then it's hard to see, but the red lines are the LA County Sanitation District sewer pump stations. And there are other systems that kind of interweave with the Long Beach system as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  So what are some of the ways that the utilities department aims to prevent sewage overflows in this system? They conduct routine and preventative maintenance of a variety of different approaches to prevent these things like fats and oils from restaurants being discharged in the sewage system that could create a blockage. They also have been implementing what's called smart cover technology that is essentially an alert system that allows the department to know when a sewage line is reaching capacity and it can prevent an overflow when you know this is reaching too high of a limit for the system and allows them to go in and address the issue before it overflows. And then they also have clear sewage spill procedure and protocol whenever there is an issue that happens within the long beach system. And specifically looking at ways to contain the spill to as small of an impact as possible. So with all of that, I think as highlighted in the report and what you can see here, just some of the comparisons between the long beach sewage system are spill rates here versus the state and regional averages. You can see we are near zero in terms of the category one spills which again are the most concerning spills that would make it into open waterways. And this again is an area where based on all the work that our utilities department does, I think is a testament to all the hard work that we do in long beach to prevent spills from actually seeping into our open waterways. And you can see here similar comparison for 2023 as well. So with that again, I think the third point is we're doing very well in long beach to prevent sewage spills. So what are the impacts? How are we still facing this challenge? A lot of it in long beach these challenges are overwhelmingly because of upstream spills. So this is more of a regional challenge that we need to work together to figure out how do we address and prevent sewage spills that occur in other sewage systems. But that do of course flow down to long beach and impact our community. And this is where regional partnerships with our regional water quality control board, L.A. County sanitation districts and others, I think will be really important. And just as you can see here on the slide, what happens when we do have a spill? The L.A. regional water quality control board is responsible for responding to those spills throughout the region. And they conduct investigations and also potential enforcement actions against the responsible parties. L.A. County sanitation districts, owns and operates, as mentioned, the sanitary sewage systems and pumping plants and parts of the region and even long beach. And so they help to monitor spills and conduct water sampling when those occur. And if this bill is in long beach or flows into our waterways, the city and our health and human services department is responsible for collecting water samples from the beaches, the bays and marinas in the harbor area to test that water. So ultimately, if we do have a spill in the system that flows down to long beach and water quality samples exceed the state standards, then the city would be responsible for closing the impacted beaches. \nSPEAKER_00:  and continuing to conduct water quality samples until it reaches the appropriate levels. So part of the council direction was to also look at when we do have these instances of beach closure, what are the impacts? I think the health impacts are pretty clear and obvious and we do our best to prevent those by, of course, having or closing our beaches. But over the last five years in the report outlines just the extent of our beach closures and what some of the potential fiscal and economic impacts might be from those closures. And ultimately, it is difficult to assess the economic impacts of previous beach closures. A lot of it, you can try to estimate beach attendance and then average that out for a specific time of the year and then calculate an estimate of what you think would be a loss in terms of maybe sales tax revenue or TOT revenue due to a closure. But there's a lot of conjecture with some of these indirect impacts from an economic standpoint. We even tried to look at parking revenue data in the beach lots during beach closures and compared to sort of normal beach days. And there is definitely a decline in average daily revenue for these beach parking lots, but no clear pattern. So it's not clear, you know, every beach closure day will average a thousand dollars in lost revenue or whatever that might be. There's kind of a change in the rate of decline. So again, it's very difficult to actually assess some of the economic and indirect impacts. But one thing that we would recommend and what we can start implementing moving forward is to start tracking what our personnel costs are related to. \nSPEAKER_00:  reactions or responding, I should say to \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, sewage spills and beach closures. So like I mentioned, our health department, a number of other departments are involved in beach closures ensuring that, ensuring health and safety during sewage spills. And at this point, we have not tracked personnel costs directly during those beach closures, but this is something that we can easily implement in something that we've done during the COVID-19 pandemic. And even during a homelessness emergency is coding time on our time cards differently so that we can track how many hours are actually going towards the response to an issue like that. So again, this is an area, I think, of opportunity for us to really understand some of those fiscal impacts to beach closures moving forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  Another item I wanted to mention based on the Council Action is related to just understanding what are some of the resources that are available to try to address this issue. And the Council Action wanted additional information around Measure W, which is a countywide measure that collects revenue to go towards stormwater and urban runoff system infrastructure improvements. So Long Beach has actually been very successful at getting resources through Measure W. We've gotten nearly $40 million through Measure W so far and 14 million under consideration, very significant amount of investment in Long Beach specifically through Measure W. But again, I wanted to emphasize that some of these infrastructure improvements like at Long Beach must or LB must are stormwater treatment facility that's underway. It won't necessarily help us prevent sewage spill from impacting our beaches because once sewage or wastewater enters our open waterways, it's obviously very challenging to stop and prevent all of that water from flowing down the system. So even if we can treat urban runoff, a stormwater through a facility like LB must, we really need to address upstream infrastructure needs to prevent those sewage overflows from happening in the first place. So additional resources that are available related to sewage spills would be at the state level there is a fund. It's called the Clean Up and Abatement Account that can provide grants of up to $500,000 for Clean Up or Abatement projects statewide. One of the challenges and thank you for Council District 3 staff in the mayor's office. We work together to try to strategize with our partners. How do we draw down some of those resources to Long Beach which we are impacted by these sewage spills potentially more than some other communities as well. The funding that goes into this goes to a statewide account that then could be dispersed for projects in other parts of the state. So there's not necessarily a direct correlation between the impacts that we see in our community and where some of those enforcement dollars go. \nSPEAKER_00:  The other opportunity would be if there's a settlement could be possible that some of the penalty amount is reinvested directly in the community through what are called supplemental environmental projects. And this is an area where Sharon and I and LA County sanitation districts have worked together to try to identify opportunities to draw down some of those resources for Long Beach specifically. And then the other area for potential recovery resources as an impact of sewage bills would be of course potential legal action. And I think moving forward if the city is able to calculate and better understand the fiscal impacts of a sewage spill, there are more opportunities to take legal action against the polluters directly. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the last piece I just want to close with some of the staff recommendations thinking about what do we do with all of this? Pretty complex issue. It's a very challenging issue as you mentioned in your opening comments, Chair. You know, it's what do we do? This is more of a regional challenge, not necessarily something that we can address on our own. You know, as I mentioned, our utilities department has done an excellent job to prevent this issue from occurring in Long Beach. So a few things that we would recommend, one, in terms of being able to estimate the fiscal impact moving forward, would be to start calculating, as mentioned, what the staff time and costs are whenever there is a beach closure. And this is, as I mentioned, very easy to do. We can code our time differently. Really, no action is needed at this point, aside from we can work closely with our financial management team to ensure that there's a process in place to code our time in these instances. And that will help to potentially allow for legal action if the city chooses in future instances. The other three bullets here are really about how do we advocate regionally and what can we do to help some of our regional partners to prevent sewage spills moving forward? So this is where I think we can include language in our legislative agenda that would allow us to really engage in this issue regionally and at the state level. We should leverage our regional partnerships more, like with the Allie County Sanitation Districts and the Regional Law to Quality Control Board, trying to identify areas of we can partner to address infrastructure issues before they lead to sewage overflows. We can also advocate for resources for neighboring jurisdictions that are upstream to improve some of those sewage infrastructure needs in their communities, not just advocating, of course, for our own infrastructure improvements. And the other thing would be more state advocacy, again, tying back to that fund that is distributing resources statewide. There has been an effort to address through legislation and bring more of those dollars to the communities that are most impacted by the sewage spills. So that's another area I think where moving forward, we can continue to advocate for those resources to come to the local communities that are most impacted. So from this, I definitely would recommend and would appreciate additional direction or input on what you would like staff to \nSPEAKER_00:  or how you would like us to move forward with some of the regional advocacy, I think that's an area of opportunity for us on this issue. And with that, happy to answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you so much, Tyler. That was great, great information. I'd like to open it up for public comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  If any members of the public would like to speak at this time on this item, please come to the podium now. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, Madam Chair and members of the committee. I'm Sharon Green. I'm with the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. Thank you for the opportunity to. \nSPEAKER_01:  speak and I will try to be brief. \nSPEAKER_01:  I did want to just briefly mention that we have collaborated with the City of Long Beach, both with the staff on this effort and then also more generally over the years. We have 24 districts and three of those districts serve the needs of Long Beach. And as Tyler mentioned, we provide wastewater treatment. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the regional collective collector sewers known as trunk sewers. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the mayor of Long Beach or city council member in currently council member Sarah serve on our boards of directors so we're directly \nSPEAKER_01:  working together and we've collaborated on recycled water for the city for many years as well as on the surf facilities where we have a joint power authority. So we have a long history of working together with the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  I wanted to also just take them a moment to complement the city on the report that they provided for you. It was very well done. \nSPEAKER_01:  We did meet with them and we appreciated the time from the staff and Bureau of Environmental Health as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  We wanted to talk about two main points. Obviously we want to acknowledge we have had several spills in the past few years that have affected the city of Long Beach, which are certainly regrettable. We strive. \nSPEAKER_01:  for a hundred percent prevention of all spills and we have a program to work on that very similar to what Tyler mentioned Men I mean we basically do all of those same types of measures in our \nSPEAKER_01:  program as well. And we do have a very low rate of stills that occur, but nonetheless, some still do, and we have to strive to get to zero. That's always our goal. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  And one thing I want to mention, there was a very large spill at the end of 2021. In the city of Carson, that went to the Dominguez Channel, that of course came down. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the part areas and to the beaches and they were closed. But one thing that came out of that, we try to learn from every single event that happens. And so we commissioned an outside audit, in that case, usually we do our own internal \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  review of what happened and what the causes of the still were and so forth and what we can improve. But in that case, we did an outside external audit and we have been implementing all of the measures that they recommended. Most of those are already have been implemented a few are a little bit longer term and are in progress. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as a result of that, we have \nSPEAKER_01:  Great accelerated our program to repair and rehabilitate our sewers and have increased our capital spending by about 250% to about a hundred million per year. Going forward we always have been investing but we realize the need to increase that substantially. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're doing things like investing in new closer circuit TV cameras. Like we've already had a long standing program to use CC TV in the sewers. That's a long standing practice. But we're getting better equipment and many other changes like that that we are currently making to kind of \nSPEAKER_00:  themselves as a smith who receive a valid ad on Monday. 22 DAYS. \nSPEAKER_01:  have a state-of-the-art program. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we're really focused on this in part because we do have aging infrastructure, but also because of climate and the need to have more resiliency in the face of \nSPEAKER_01:  more extreme events that can occur, whether it's very low flows or much higher flows during wet weather. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so we also want to mention that we do agree with the staff's recommendation that it would be beneficial to have additional federal state and or regional funding available for all of the local jurisdictions to invest in their sanctuary sewer systems. And we are active in advocacy on that front. We'd be happy to partner and collaborate with both Long Beach and other jurisdictions and the county. And we do have an effort known as infrastructure LA that like counties leading and we're participating in that and we're happy to bring that forward within that structure. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then one other point I wanted to make sure that I mentioned we do always strive to have a very robust response if an overflow does occur. We mobilize our response team as quickly as possible to the scene to take steps to determine the extent and cause of a spill. Then we focus on stopping the spill at the source and capture any of the volume that we are able to return it to the sewer. \nSPEAKER_01:  And clean all of the affected areas very thoroughly and quickly mobilize a team to sample water quality if that's warranted. And we also have very strict notification requirements. We're notifying all of the \nSPEAKER_01:  local state and regional authorities within two hours of any, you know, becoming aware of a spill happening. So that includes the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that brings me to the other main. \nSPEAKER_01:  point I wanted to make or topic. \nSPEAKER_01:  If a spilt from one of our sewers reaches one of the creeks or the rivers, namely the LA River or the San Gabriel River. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  We collect water quality data and those water bodies, as was mentioned in Tyler's presentation, as \nSPEAKER_01:  appropriate and required by our permits. We always notify the Bureau of Environmental Health, as I mentioned, if a spill occurs, that may impact beaches so that they can take appropriate action. And we always provide the data from our sampling events to the Bureau as soon as it becomes available. However, as noted, the Bureau does collect its own samples after a sewage built to use for decision-making about when it's safe to reopen the beaches. \nSPEAKER_01:  So one thing we'd like to offer is that we would like to see if there was a possibility for collaboration so that our data can be used which would sort of promote efficiency. So both agencies aren't having staff out collecting data for the same \nSPEAKER_01:  purpose basically and it might also minimize the number of beach closure days, which I believe is our mutual goal. So we mobilize and collect data seven days a week, doesn't matter what time of year, what kind of other than if there's a safety concern, we're out there taking those samples. And we do have certified laboratories as well, similar to what the city uses. So we do think that that's worth exploring. We did raise it with the city. We understand and the report mentions this that they're, you know, it's not quite consistent with the regulations. We're willing to explore potentially changing the life that's needed to, you know, just make a tweak because it is already allowed for the purpose of. \nSPEAKER_01:  beach water quality monitoring like in the summer for the beach advisories. That's already there's already provisions to allow third parties to collect data and for the public health authorities to use that data. So we're just suggesting to do the same thing post spill. So in closing, we would respectfully request the committee \nSPEAKER_01:  and the city to work with us and other stakeholders to maybe find a path forward to collaborate on this and some of the other recommendations that were mentioned. Thank you so much for your time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Ms. Green. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd like to move to our committee members. Council Member Aronga. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, thank you for your presentation. Thank you, Courtney. \nSPEAKER_03:  Dr. Curry, we just teach it as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was paying a special attention. That's the reason I wanted to. \nSPEAKER_03: often we know it doesn't take this water because we've got into deepplease We can't wanna talk about it in spaces now this Drptions just keep here you can see that the reason I'm not telling you alleged plaque Where the adloub Husband is Going to have a dream W McK \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 W destro W W W W W W W W W W W Yu W \nSPEAKER_03:  Switching. \nSPEAKER_03:  Just go get water. \nSPEAKER_03:  all use it same time, so I use what? \nSPEAKER_03:  I better just stay here to wear. \nSPEAKER_03:  Where we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't regret that there was a clarification on that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Here we go. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's been a genius. \nSPEAKER_03:  is for a long beach. \nSPEAKER_03:  hot track. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for bringing up. \nSPEAKER_03:  whatever he c drags it that was \nSPEAKER_03:  for most of my mind right now. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's her what happened last year. \nSPEAKER_03:  with Carson. \nSPEAKER_03:  the Point,\u0106er Rog \nSPEAKER_03:  to discover by now what happened. \nSPEAKER_03:  and of course he uh... \nSPEAKER_03:  Be sure that \nSPEAKER_03:  Hey, this is happening again. \nSPEAKER_03:  Of course. \nSPEAKER_03:  That they've always been sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  something will always happen. It's like a Murphy-British book. Okay, Will. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, bye, bye. Next point will be... \nSPEAKER_03:  very much interested with Quaidon with her. \nSPEAKER_03:  Stewart Water. \nSPEAKER_03:  We must. \nSPEAKER_03:  Love each most. \nSPEAKER_03:  Where were we with that? \nSPEAKER_03:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_03:  for where I understand it's easy to be. \nSPEAKER_03:  Progressing well, there seems to be some. \nSPEAKER_03:  progress made, it kept me that water and \nSPEAKER_03:  yolk\uc744 \nSPEAKER_03:  So where are we with, we love each place. \nSPEAKER_03:  in terms of its development. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we'll see it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, to shit. \nSPEAKER_03:  full of the operation. \nSPEAKER_00:  I don't have specifics, unfortunately, I apologize, but it is definitely underway, and that's one of the key projects, of course, as part of the larger vision in the Drake Chavez area along with the Shoemaker Bridge and Shoreline Relignment. It's all related investments in park space and public infrastructure. So I think, you know, this is one of the key projects, especially in terms of water runoff and also tree-minplanned. I don't know if anybody else has any specifics on the project, but... \nSPEAKER_00:  Otherwise, yeah, we can follow up with public works and get some information about it. I'll be must to be able to provide to you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Perhaps better to take advantage of your problem. \nSPEAKER_03:  Whoever taking on this, that\u2014 \nSPEAKER_03:  Love each person, maybe appropriate. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councilman Superna. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you and great report we appreciate it. I want to talk about a phenomenon in Long Beach that I guess Long Beach is the tail of the dog that were the ones who feel all the wagging. And it's \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a commonality from a rain event and a sewage spill in terms of our coastline. \nSPEAKER_02:  And we noticed something at the recent rain event, and perhaps it happened because it was at an odd time a year for a rain event. \nSPEAKER_02:  But we got complaints that the beach wasn't, the caution tape was that more, the signage wasn't up like it would be during the winter time. And there's probably a lot of factors there. \nSPEAKER_02:  Although at this, this rain event, we had the, the berms being built and whatnot. You had maybe lifeguard personnel who were taken up with actually doing lifeguarding jobs. I don't know, we haven't studied it. And I typically don't comment on this. \nSPEAKER_02:  phenomenon because it's not in my council district. I have all the San Gabriel River and north of seven street that occupies plenty of my time. But I think that maybe we look at protocols the same way whereas the rest of the county would separate sewage spills from rain events and we just can't afford to do that. And we just like to see those protocols for what we do in terms of noticing people that we have high bacteria levels in the ocean water to be very standard. And so we have those warnings out there in a consistent basis so no one manages to go into ocean water without seeing a sign. And we've heard about it both in the Belmont Shore area and I think at the launch ramp down here by Golden Shore. So I just don't have an opportunity to mention this office so I want to bring that up. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  A lot of information to go through regarding this item. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm glad that we're looking to pursue, I want to pursue staff's recommendations. \nSPEAKER_05:  Over the last couple of months, Mayor's office, Mr. Curly, my office, we've been meeting with the Water Board and it's been really good to understand how the system works. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I just want to point out a couple of things that we have learned, reiterating them. The first is the finds issued by the Regional Water Board goes to a statewide account, and that's issued statewide. So we aren't receiving benefits that \nSPEAKER_05:  the tail wagging the dog. We often, we're having to deal with that. Our regional water board is a leader in enforcement, but if the fine, but the fine stone always come back, go back to our regional area. So we should be advocating for more of that funding to go to our region as well. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think... \nSPEAKER_05:  Another way to look at it is raising water rates to prevent sewage spills is a potential, but that's political. And I don't think anyone wants to vote to approve water rates to invest in infrastructure. So a lot of our cities upstream are using old sewage systems and don't have ways to improve those sewage systems. \nSPEAKER_05:  But that doesn't mean Long Beach should be footing the bill for these impacts and \nSPEAKER_05:  I understand it's going to be hard to track the indirect impact, but I think we do need to start billing the entities upriver and if they're not able to improve their infrastructure, we still have to hold some accountability to them. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I want to go back to what Ms. Green had said about collaborating for testing. One of the questions I have, Tyler, is when we do testing, we're doing it three times a week, right? \nSPEAKER_05:  Is that ready for health department? \nSPEAKER_00:  Unless there is a spill and then yeah they would do it more regularly, but I think the Normal kind of testing that we're responsible for as a city. Yeah, that would be the the usual cadence \nSPEAKER_05:  If we have a spill on a Friday or Saturday, are we testing same day? \nSPEAKER_00:  My understanding from the health department is yes, we would test more regularly in the event of a spill. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so I would like to pursue talking about collaboration with the LA County sanitation district. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I'd like to move to approve staff's recommendation. \nSPEAKER_05:  and refer any of the advocacy items to the legislative agenda. \nSPEAKER_03:  Khad dwa Mabrabani \nSPEAKER_05:  any other comments before we go to vote? \nSPEAKER_00:  Nothing for me. That makes sense and we will definitely of course work with Chair Aronga with the Intergovernmental Affairs Committee hopefully in the next couple months on the legislative agenda. So this is definitely a welcome addition I think to that conversation and looking at ways that we can continue to advocate and partner regionally. \nSPEAKER_05:  Great, thank you. Let's go to vote."

Moving to agenda item three, Meredith and Tyler are going to provide. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Can you read the item? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  recommendation to receive in Fowler Report on the project submitted for NOAA Climate Challenge Grant. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right, so now Meredith is going to give us a presentation regarding the inflation reduction act and the NOAA climate challenge. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, thank you. Chair, members of the committee, Meredith Reynolds, Deputy City Manager, and joined today by Tyler Curley, our Acting Deputy City Manager, and for Nguyenna, our Climate Manager, for today's presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  Today we're going to cover a little bit kind of ground us in our climate action plan with a brief overview. We're going to talk a little bit about the inflation reduction act, that overview and thinking about how we go about searching for grants. \nSPEAKER_01:  Then we will sort of wrap up with talking a little bit about the funding opportunities and the summary of projects that we have applied for for some of our recent opportunities and some of the opportunities we have been awarded. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I'm going to turn it over to Fern who's going to talk a little bit about our climate action plan to ground us today. \nSPEAKER_02:  Good afternoon. So our Long Beach Climate Action Plan was adopted by City Council August 16, 2022, and the CAP is our primary planning and policy document that is focused on climate change. It was developed over several years through extensive stakeholder and community input. And it's designed to help us meet our various policy commitments, including our legal greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. \nSPEAKER_02:  And the plan focuses on two areas, climate mitigation, which is to reduce the impact that people have on our climate system by reducing GG emissions and climate adaptation to reduce the negative impact that climate change has on infrastructure services and the well being of the community. \nSPEAKER_02:  In our vision for the cap, which leads all of the work that we're doing with the cap implementation, is to create a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable city by addressing climate change in a way that remedies existing environmental health disparities, while also improving health, quality of life, and economic vitality throughout Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the two parts of the plan, the first is climate mitigation. \nSPEAKER_02:  And the three sectors that we measure are building an energy, which account for 49.2% of our emissions and long beach transportation at 44.5% and waste at 6.3%. And our climate action plan has a number of items to, a number of action items to address all of these three mitigation sectors. And with those action items, we do believe that we will meet our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. And you can see that the blue line is our 2030 target. \nSPEAKER_02:  and with the mitigation that we're proposing, we anticipate that we'll be below that. \nSPEAKER_02:  In the climate stressors that are impacting our communities are extreme heat, air quality drought and seal of a rise with flooding. And so these are the ones that we are focused on in the cap and a lot of our action items relate to these. And there's a lot of kind of co-benefits if you're working to implement improvements for extreme heat, it could also help with air quality or drought in vice versa. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we know that it's vital to take action now to implement the cap. We need to continue working on our climate action in order to meet our greenhouse gas reduction goals for 2030 and 2045. And we also know that our community is already experiencing the impacts of climate change today from extreme heat air quality drought and sea level rise and flooding. So these are just a few statistics we wanted to highlight today just to show the urgency of why the climate action work that we're doing is so important. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so that was just a brief summary of the climate action plan just to some lays some context as Meredith said. And I do want to provide a little bit more information about our office. So the Council approved new climate action positions with our fiscal year 23 budget. And those positions were combined with our existing office of sustainability. And we did some recruitment and our final hires of staff were done in March. And the primary role of the climate action side of the office is to implement monitor and track and report on cap implementation. \nSPEAKER_02:  But we also have another number of other things that we work on. And so we work closely with the Climate Resilient and Sustainable City Commission, and we've been working to align all of their work under CAP. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we additionally have been working on a lot of grant applications in order to implement projects that help us move forward with the cap work. \nSPEAKER_02:  And as an office, one of our important things is partnering with departments across the city, especially with our government affairs team. So we will hear from them next. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, thank you. Again, I appreciate the opportunity. I want to take a step back and talk about historic resources that are available and coming down the pike for environmental climate action and adaptation. So ways that we can capitalize, I think, on a lot of federal dollars that are available over the coming years to help implement our Long Beach cap. Again, just to take a step back, thinking about when the Biden administration came on board, they had a pretty historic and significant vision for what they had called Build Back Better. People love the literature, I guess. But ultimately, this turned into two monstrous historic investment bills. The first is the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which the city has benefited from already in terms of receiving $30 million for our Shoreline Realignment Project. There are a number of different grant opportunities that we're already going after that are part of this infrastructure investment package. And again, that alone was historic in terms of the amount of opportunities that are available through that bill. And about a year after that, they were able to also pass what's called the Inflation Reduction Act, which also has historic investments specifically related to climate. But what is in the Inflation Reduction Act are three main pillars. The first is around climate. So that's what we're going to focus on today, which is hundreds of billions of dollars that are going to be available and starting to flow down for climate and energy related spending. So I'll get into some of those details. But also part of this legislation were important changes to taxation, to be able to generate revenues and offset the impacts of inflation. And then prescription drug pricing provisions as well that, again, aren't as relevant to this committee and what we're talking about today. But oddly enough, I don't know if the bill did a lot to reduce inflation, but it did do a lot in terms of propelling and catalyzing investment in climate, which we're very interested in here. So in terms of some of the investments from the Inflation Reduction Act related to climate, first category is really looking at tax credit programs. There are a number of significant investments in programs that will try to incentivize the adoption and transition to clean energy. Starting from encouraging consumers to purchase electric vehicles through tax credits to also encouraging and incentivizing manufacturing of clean technology, a number of different categories where the federal government will be investing in tax credit programs again to propel our transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy investments. The other area, of course, just more significant direct investments in programming, which is distinct from tax credit programs, would be some investments in offshore wind projects in the Gulf and some of the southern U.S. states. So this won't directly benefit our pure wind conversation that we're having in Long Beach. But again, for some of our national efforts, our very important to transition to offshore wind, looking at also incentivizing again the transition to clean energy by increasing the rates and charges for offshore oil and gas leases. There are other programs I know are \nSPEAKER_01:  interesting. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now I got a community development department. I have to reprogram my mind. Our development services, our community development department is interested in around ways to encourage the transition to clean energy in homes as well. And in the sort of the construction side of the market through rebate programs for homeowners to transition to clean energy and so on. So again, a number of different ways to incentivize and encourage a market transition essentially to clean energy. But for our purposes directly as a city and how do we implement our cap, how do we advocate and go after direct grant opportunities. There are really important programs that we wanna talk about as well. So the Inflation Reduction Act also includes not just those investments in the clean energy transition the tax credits and so on, I just mentioned. But also is consciously developed around what they are calling the Justice 40 Initiative, which is a commitment to delivering 40% of these federal dollars to communities that are most impacted by climate change and could benefit from the investments in some of these programs like we have developed in the cap. So a lot of the focus for grants that are becoming available through not only in the Infrastructure Investment Act that I mentioned, but also the Inflation Reduction Act. Are focused on communities most impacted by climate change through this Justice 40 Initiative. And we have looked through the legislation. There are over a hundred different climate related programs and initiatives as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. And a number of those are eligible for some of our partner entities, non-governmental organizations and others that will benefit the community if we're able to draw down resources. But there are also about a dozen competitive grant programs through this Investment Act that we as a city will be able to engage in directly in terms of our grant advocacy. And with that, I'll transition back over to, so we can provide an overview of what is our strategy and approach to going after those competitive grants. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks Tyler. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as we think about the Inflation Reduction Act, and this is consistent with what we do with many of our possible funding sources, is we take a look at how we align an existing project need that is a priority for our city with a grant opportunity that might be present in front of us. And so throughout the year, we convene a regular grants collaborative from everyone across the city that works on grants, and we identify those priority projects in need of grant funding each year, and prepare that in a way that we are ready to go to apply for grants. We often look at the projects and priorities that are listed in the State and Federal Legislative Agendas, the projects that are listed in a variety of our adopted and approved city council plans. We look at things that are aligned with our strategic vision in 2030, and also other areas that are a priority consistent with the Justice 40, like our equity investment areas, and things that perhaps are in another type of approved master plan, let's say for capital projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  So with that, we know the number of things that we are looking for, funding for, and we're able to align those project needs with the grant opportunities. So as we think about the inflation reduction act, we did a very similar thing, and we're going to talk a little bit about one of the opportunities that was in front of us recently. And that was a grant that came from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, otherwise known as NOAA. And this was part of their Climate Resilient Regional Challenge Grant. So this grant lists out a whole number of things in the grant guidelines. We've provided just a couple of highlights here for you all for today. But this grant funds regionally significant projects that build resilience of coastal communities to extreme weather and other climate change impacts. \nSPEAKER_01:  The grant in particular has two funding tracks. Sometimes grants have a single track, and sometimes they have multiple. This one has two. And one is for strategy development, things like planning, feasibility studies, et cetera. And the second track is for project implementation. So the implementation, say, of a major capital project. \nSPEAKER_01:  The eligibility is state and local governments, tribes and tribal organizations, nonprofits and institutions of higher education, and really focused on being from or supporting coastal communities and great lakes communities. So this is not open to just any community you actually have to have a coast or be impacted by the coast directly. So that limits the type of agency or institution being able to apply. \nSPEAKER_01:  This was a particular process that was identified by the grant agency. And so they asked for letters of intent, which is a shorter packet of information, and that those who scored highest on their eligibility criteria would be invited to submit a full proposal. And so full applications are due February 13th. And those who applied were told that we would hear by early October at such point we would be invited for the full application or not. So we're still waiting to hear back from the agency for the projects we applied for, which I'll share with you momentarily. \nSPEAKER_01:  for this grant in particular, the evaluation criteria is something that we focus very closely on as we develop our letters of intent or if we're doing a full application because this is what the grant agency uses to essentially grade our proposals. And so in this case, the grant for the NOAA grant criteria focus very heavily on regional collaboration, equity outreach, risk reduction and what they called enduring capacity. And so that really focused on marginalized, underserved, and underrepresented communities and building capacity within and across regional networks because ultimately we know the coast is not just ours, it's connected to many other cities who face the coast. And so they were looking for sort of that regional approach. \nSPEAKER_01:  The project proposals are going to be scored based on how well they address risk reduction, regional collaboration, equity inclusion, things like technical and scientific merit. We're talking about the coast, which is a very sensitive habitat and ecosystem. And so we needed to be thoughtful in our proposals about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Overall qualifications of the funding applicants and so they ask questions about things about our capacity and our history of proposing and fulfilling projects of this magnitude. Certainly the reasonfulness of project cost and then our work on outreach and engagement for a particular project. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the regional collaborative strategy development, which is the first track, is really designed to support building regional partnerships, engaging with our underserved and underrepresented communities, assessing risk and vulnerability, things like planning and feasibility studies, and building community and workforce capacity for climate adaptation efforts. And there's a whole bunch of detail behind each one of these, which is just sort of high level for the committee here. So you can see what we were evaluating. And then ultimately the implementation track, which is track two, is designed to acquire vulnerable land, build natural infrastructure, strengthen or protect public access to the coast, build regional capacity, planning and preparing for community-led relocation, which is not something that's part of any of our projects, but is eligible. And then updating state and local codes and policies. So we had all of these things to choose from as we were thinking about what aligns with some of our priority projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  The NOAA grant did include a specific list of what is ineligible in terms of projects. And so replacement of sand on beaches for reneurishment was ineligible construction of shoreline stabilization structures like breakwater, riprap, jetties, sea walls, those sorts of things were ineligible. So we had to be mindful of the things that they would not fund as we submitted our applications. \nSPEAKER_01:  as we submitted our letters of intent. \nSPEAKER_01:  So here's a handful of things that we were able to pull together in terms of our letters of intent. And because this grant allowed for that smaller package as opposed to the full application, there are times when we make a choice and we have the bandwidth to submit more than one. And as long as the grant does not determine that you can't do that, we do try. And ultimately, if the grant agency can see a number of the projects that we prioritize, they may be inclined to pick one or over the other. And it potentially gives us a better chance at funding. So that's not always the case, but sometimes that is the case. And in the case of the NOAA grant, we were able to do that strategically. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we have a couple things that we submitted, some for Track 1 and some for Track 2, and we were able to partner with Infrastructure LA, as was referenced earlier, in developing some of these concepts, and achieving some letters of support, and providing our letters of support for some of the other regional projects as well, so we can demonstrate that regional approach. \nSPEAKER_01:  So for the first... \nSPEAKER_01:  The letter of intent proposal that we submitted was for a feasibility study for solar and our law of beach marinas. We do have some ongoing projects that we are looking at through public works. But being more holistic about how do we think about kind of cohesively solar in our marinas for EV charging for providing future electricity for the boats and the live of boards of the boat slips for our own. So we have a beach equipment and for those who may want to park when they are visiting Long Beach. So this is a feasibility study to determine what could be feasible in some of those areas. Certainly this is subject to if we go for the full grant, coastal commission approval at the end of the day for any project. But the feasibility study we are able to kind of think that through and partner regionally with others along the coast and also the coastal commission. So we will see if this is something that is supported by the grant agency. \nSPEAKER_01:  The second project you asked a little bit about earlier is the municipal storm water treatment facility, Long Beach MUST. And so from what I know, the... \nSPEAKER_01:  Facility itself is under construction as is the adjacent one acre retention wetland But there's other phases of this project that remain unfunded so a future phase connects all of the pump stations up and down the 710 Freeway to Long Beach must to be able to convey the additional dry weather and first flush flows to the Elby must facility for that processing and so this is a project that we're asking for funding for for track 2 for project implementation \nSPEAKER_01:  Another one of the letters of intent we submitted was for the Alameda Sbae Water Quality Enhancement Project. This is a track two project implementation letter of intent. And this is around installing our new fish friendly pumps to maintain existing water circulation and protect the water quality of Alameda Sbae. So these new pumps are needed after phasing out some past pumps from the AES plant that have circulated water in the bay for half a century and we really want to be able to maintain that water quality. So that was one of the proposals that we submitted as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then we also submitted a Long Beach Living Shore project. This is for Track 2 for Project Implementation. And this is part of a larger regional strategy that City of LA and others are looking at along the coast, where potentially able to add a network of dunes using native landscape along the beachfront and in our case, along the one mile of Peninsula. Thinking through this, this is really a focus on protecting the peninsula from sea level rise and flooding through a more permanent structure that creates native habitat. And there's a similar proposal submitted by LA County, as I mentioned, kind of that regional approach. \nSPEAKER_01:  So those are the ones that were ultimately submitted as a part of the letters of intent. And so if any of those gain enough points, we could be invited to submit the full proposal in February. \nSPEAKER_01:  Aside from those, there have been additional inflation reduction at grants that we have been paying attention to and following Tyler mentioned of the 107 opportunities. There are 13 that the city can apply for and we have begun to apply for a number of these because they do align in pretty much all cases with priorities from our climate action plan or for other adopted city council plans. \nSPEAKER_01:  One of those opportunities is the USDA Forest Service Urban and Community Forestry Program. We're just alerted. Believe it was last week. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we were awarded a million dollars for the installation of stormwater infiltration and street trees to improve water quality, reduce stormwater pollution and mitigate urban heat. And so this is a proposal that we submitted several months ago, lined with our goals of our climate action plan, and really focused on, in our cap, we have a map that shows the areas that face the most extreme heat. And now those overlap with areas in northwest and central Long Beach, and so the proposal is to align. \nSPEAKER_01:  the project with those areas to mitigate that urban heat. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have also participated in a regional effort as a part of the EPA climate pollution reduction grant. This was submitted by LA County with a number of supporting organizations including the city of Long Beach. Were they applied for climate action planning grant for the Los Angeles Long Beach and a high metro area. So we have our own climate action plan here for Long Beach and this would be a region wide plan. And so all of the things from our plan are anticipated to be incorporated into the region's plan, along with a lot of our research that we had completed in order to get that approved. So LA County will lead this and we will be a partner in this. This is a planning grant and so those who \nSPEAKER_01:  Participate in the planning grant are become then eligible to apply for projects for the implementation grant So that was the important part of the strategy of of the partnering with LA County So that we are all then A make ourselves available for those future implementation grant dollars and that's a lot bigger pot than the planning grant \nSPEAKER_01:  So ultimately the awards, the grant award was from $2,500,000,000, that's the larger numbers for those implementation projects. And the implementation projects, applications are due April 1, 2024. So we will continue to partner with LA County on that opportunity. \nSPEAKER_01:  And finally, we are anticipating a number of future grant opportunities from the Inflation Reduction Act. I just included two here that are timely and upcoming. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we have the Department of Transportation reconnecting communities in neighborhoods grant. We are looking at a number of these. There's a planning grant and a construction grant, so two tracks for this one as well. And so looking at some opportunities to look at some of our bike projects, some of our green belt projects and a number of other things. And so that is due September 28th. That's really focused on community center transportation connection projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  with a focus on those that benefit disadvantaged communities and improve access to jobs, education, health care, food, nature, and recreation. So there's a number of our priority projects that fit this one. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then finally, NOAA has a second different and separate grant called Transformation Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience. And so that's due November 17th. We also have a number of projects, priority projects that could align with this grant and we're beginning to explore those with city partners. And this is really focused on supporting habitat restoration projects that restore marine and coastal ecosystems, really using approaches that enhance resilience to climate hazards. So there's a million dollars to 25 million dollars available as a part of this grant. And so we are trying to identify what priorities fit within that opportunity. \nSPEAKER_01:  So there's a lot happening around the Inflation Reduction Act and all of the different grant sources. Our goal is really to maximize the amount of grant funds, too long beach to supplement all of the great things that we already do. And so there's a very dedicated team between those you see here and those who support us across the departments on projects and planning that sort of put our heads together to think about how best to strategize going after these funds. So that's just sort of a preview of some of the work we've been doing and what we're going to be focusing on moving forward and myself, Tyler and Fern, are available to answer any questions. So thank you for the opportunity to present today. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much. That is a lot of information. And I think it's just a fraction of what you all are doing. So it's appreciated. I want to open it up to public comment. Is there any? \nSPEAKER_03:  If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on this item, please come to the podium now. \nSPEAKER_03:  No public comment, Chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Council Member Aronga, comments? \nSPEAKER_05:  I guess very briefly. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for your report. \nSPEAKER_05:  and let's see that you guys are on top of it. \nSPEAKER_05:  and Tertial Plymouth Grants were very much needed. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_05:  It turns out the correct details. \nSPEAKER_05:  So that buddy... \nSPEAKER_05:  Have a pink. \nSPEAKER_05:  will be based on also the ability of the city to get \nSPEAKER_05:  to the zero permits. \nSPEAKER_05:  and uh \nSPEAKER_05:  Go ahead, nods for other agencies. \nSPEAKER_05:  As an example, as you know, I just did it in the Compton Commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it's already to come to somebody's grads that you're playing for. I think require code permission approval. \nSPEAKER_05:  So just try to... \nSPEAKER_05:  \uc88b\uc73c\ub7ec\uc624\ub2d8 \uc778\uae30 \nSPEAKER_05:  Who would have been the event that... \nSPEAKER_05:  The project. \nSPEAKER_05:  He is that accepted. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  porn Yoo \nSPEAKER_05:  rejected. \nSPEAKER_05:  by the concentration. \nSPEAKER_05:  for one reason or another. \nSPEAKER_05:  He's like, uh... \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll make a plan or it's here. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Some other... \nSPEAKER_05:  How are you? We can take to the job. \nSPEAKER_05:  So give it a play. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure, thank you, Councilmember Bioranga. In terms of projects that require coastal commission partnership, many of those begin in a planning phase where they and others are invited to the table to talk about what would it take to make that project possible or feasible. And so that would be our first approach so that the folks who need to weigh in who ultimately would be responsible for environmental clearance or permits or any sort of permissions or approvals would be part of the conversation and part of the project. So that's sort of our always our first a mode is to be inclusive for those partners. So that when we end up with say a feasibility report or a plan that those agencies are comfortable with the recommendations or the study that is included in those plans. And assuming that they are and we apply for projects that result from them, we do have to go through the process of getting formal permits and permissions and approvals and those timelines are built into our grant proposals. And so all of that should be informed by how long their process takes and all of that sort of thing that we would rely on them to help us with as we're planning for the next stage of the project. So I think our plan B is to have a really solid plan A, right, so we wanna make sure that we are aligned with their thinking and we're able to advocate for the things that are important to us at the levels where that's appropriate so that we're able to move forward with the projects that would best serve our community. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you for your response. That's all I have, Chair. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Goeden fitting. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. I have just two questions. If there's a regional application, who handles the application? Disar staff, do they work in collaboration with LA or the region we're working with? \nSPEAKER_01:  community chair for the one for example that we worked on recently with LA County that grant called for by definition who would be eligible to be the lead agency and that was the county so it depends on what the grant requirements are and in that case it was very clear so for us that was more about what is our role to support them and to be able to have a seat at the table and to be able in this case because we have an adopted climate action plan how do we make sure that our adopted plan and all the work that went into it informs the regional plan because ultimately we don't need to reinvent the wheel here we just need ours to be a part of theirs they were you know very you know welcoming and and gracious and love to have that information because it gives them a head start at least in our region right \nSPEAKER_01:  I think there are other grant applications that either allow for more flexibility as to who the lead is or there's not quite such a specific definition as who the lead is. And so in those opportunities we may choose to recommend with our regional partners that we could step up and play that role. But certainly that's part of the larger network of conversations we've been having with infrastructure LA and other partners. And so some of this is strategic. If there is an agency who has a lot of experience doing implementing particular projects it may be best for them to be the lead and for us to be a partner. If we have a really strong history of implementing certain projects successfully it may make sense for us to be the lead. So those are some of the considerations we think about. And certainly if there's something that we are leading on others may come to us and ask that we take the lead on behalf of a number of partners. And that in historically that has happened from time to time in the past on other grants. So it sort of it depends but we also want to be really strategic. And I think ultimately at the end of the day if there is implementation money down the line and it's important for us to be able to be in line for that we want to be part of that coalition somehow. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great, thank you for that. And one more focus question. The Transformation Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience grant. Was that a letter of intent? Or did you actually, are you putting in a full application by November 17th? \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe that's a full application. And so that will likely not be so many projects. It's probably going to be just based on our initial conversations. We're kind of debating between two or three. That could be possible. And what we do is we essentially look at the scoring rubric. And we say, here's the main priorities. What points are we likely to get for some of these? And that often helps us make that decision. But this likely will not have four or five letters of intent because it's a lot more time intensive on staff's level to put together a full application. Often those require council resolutions. So you all see those when those come to council to achieve permission to apply. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that sort of thing, so it's likely that that will be a single application and it's a full application. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, and thank you again for this presentation. No more questions? \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  Do we need to make a motion or a re-receive in file? Motion to receive in file? \nSPEAKER_04:  going to the vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_04:  Wonderful. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  finish. Do we have anyone who would like to make public comment? \nSPEAKER_04:  If any members of the public would like to speak on General Open Public Comments."
