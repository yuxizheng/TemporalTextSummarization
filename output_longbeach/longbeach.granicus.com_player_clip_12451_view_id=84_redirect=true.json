Good afternoon, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. We have Fiana, Kabeana, our budget analyst here to give this presentation. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee, this presentation is to provide you with an overview of the various engagement and educational opportunities there are for the community related to the proposed FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  As an overview, residents and community members can engage in the budget process by attending the budget hearings, budget oversight committee meetings and community meetings. They can also provide feedback on the city's 2030 strategic vision and participate in the annual budget survey. \nSPEAKER_02:  Lastly, there are a number of online and other resources available to the community that provide detailed information on the budget and the budget process. \nSPEAKER_02:  throughout the month of August. \nSPEAKER_02:  We will be hosting a series of budget hearings where departments will be presenting on the proposed budgets for their departments. \nSPEAKER_02:  The City Council as well as the community will have an opportunity to provide comment and discuss. \nSPEAKER_02:  We had our first hearing on July 20 where the city manager presented the overall proposed FY22 budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  Today we will have a presentation on the proposed capital improvement plan. On August 10th, we will hear from the Health and Police Departments. On August 17th, we will hear from the Economic Development, Fire, and Civil Service Departments. \nSPEAKER_02:  August 24th and September 7th are the dates that the City Council can potentially adopt the budget. \nSPEAKER_02:  There are also a few budget oversight committee meetings scheduled throughout the month that will address various topics related to the proposed budget and the city's finances. \nSPEAKER_02:  Anyone from the public can participate in these as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  This year we are hosting four citywide community budget meetings. These meetings have been and will be in person at various locations across the city. \nSPEAKER_02:  Meeting interpretation has been available in Spanish, Kameh and Tagalog. \nSPEAKER_02:  Each meeting has had a similar format where staff will provide an overview on the proposed budget and give the community an opportunity to ask for. \nSPEAKER_02:  The City Manager's Office, Budget Office staff, and Department representatives will be at these meetings to be part of that dialogue with the community. \nSPEAKER_02:  The city is also working to create a 2030 strategic vision and at these community meetings, residents will have an opportunity to share their insight. \nSPEAKER_02:  Last week we hosted two community meetings. The first community meeting was on Tuesday, July 27th at Mark Twain Library. \nSPEAKER_02:  The second community meeting was on Thursday, July 29th at El Dorado. \nSPEAKER_02:  Park West Community Center and yesterday we hosted a community meeting at Cabriol High School. \nSPEAKER_02:  Across all events to date, we have had an estimate of 60 community members in attendance. \nSPEAKER_02:  COVID-19 continues to be a reality for our community and as such, these events require facial coverings and as the venues have allowed, we've opted for an indoor outdoor format. \nSPEAKER_02:  The final community meeting will be held next week on Thursday, August 12th at Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library. \nSPEAKER_02:  We also have the annual Community Budget Survey. \nSPEAKER_02:  available online where the community can provide their input on their priorities. \nSPEAKER_02:  Translated versions are available. Like last year's, the survey asked the community to ring different services from not too important to extremely important or no opinion, as well as allows for open-ended comments on what the city's budget priorities should be. \nSPEAKER_02:  The survey this year also includes a section for input on the city's 2030 strategic vision. \nSPEAKER_02:  The survey launched on July 16th and to date we have nearly 500 responses. The final results of this survey will be synthesized and released in a memo to City Council before budget adoption. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have a variety of resources available to the public who are interested in engaging in the budget process. Information about all of our meetings can be found online. \nSPEAKER_02:  at the FY22 budget page, longbeach.gov forward slash FY22. \nSPEAKER_02:  A flyer inviting the community to the meetings and to participate in the budget survey has been created and translated. And we have distributed. \nSPEAKER_02:  The flyer through the beach star. \nSPEAKER_02:  website. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  By cheering up and being happy. \nSPEAKER_00:  I wanted to congratulate you on being selected for an admin analyst position with the department. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hold on, one second. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Haha. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  We're gonna say well. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, listen. \nSPEAKER_01:  You're off mute. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  You took your phone, Jolissa. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  \uc624\ucf00\uc774. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  We have distributed the flyer. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  We've distributed the flyer through PeachStar, which is LBUSD's electronic delivery, flyer delivery through this delivery, we've had over 60,000 flyers. \nSPEAKER_02:  Distributed to 87 schools.

Print copies are also available at each of the library than each of our community meetings. We also have copies of our community budget book. \nSPEAKER_02:  available for the community at the community meetings and online transversions are available online as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  The community budget book includes highlights from the CARES funding, a message from the city manager and overview of the Long Beach Recovery Act funding plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  Notable proposed FY22 budget items and a general overview of the city's financial funds. \nSPEAKER_02:  Also available on our city's budget page is the budget 101 video. \nSPEAKER_02:  The video gives an overview of budget basics, such as our city's funds and funding sources. \nSPEAKER_02:  This video is available in Spanish, and we are working toward having it translated in additional languages. \nSPEAKER_02:  All of the information including every chapter of the budget book, such as the City Manager's budget message, budgets by department, \nSPEAKER_02:  Fund summaries and other attachments are available online and the city's public affairs team is also utilizing social media to promote all of the opportunities for engagement reference in this presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Additional information is available online at Long Beach.gov forward slash budget that concludes our presentation and we are available for questions. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you so much for that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Great report. I'll take it behind the rail to my council colleagues. \nSPEAKER_07:  I also remember a vice chair price. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. So I know we've had three of our community budget meetings. We used to do one in every district. \nSPEAKER_04:  So a couple of questions. Are we moving away from one in every district as a practice and \nSPEAKER_04:  Have the meetings been well attended or is there a lower turnout than expected or as we expected based on prior years? \nSPEAKER_05:  Committee member, we are looking to move away from the single budget meeting for each council district. We actually started doing this last year, which was an interesting year given that it was the pandemic. So it was the first time we actually didn't have meetings in person and had all of our meetings virtually. \nSPEAKER_05:  Those meetings actually were pretty well attended, ranging from 60 to even higher of people attending virtually. So this is the first year we are seeing how it's like to do it in person and having the citywide meetings about four across the city. So we've had... \nSPEAKER_05:  Three so far out of the four. Two of them were pretty well attended, given the average attendance that typically comes out to these meetings. \nSPEAKER_05:  The second one was not so highly attended. So I think right now it's a little early to see how consistent that might be in the future, but it is something we are looking to do. \nSPEAKER_05:  as we move forward into the future. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then the other question that I had is, \nSPEAKER_04:  I know that in the past and the third district, when we've had them as our community meeting for the month of August, we've had anywhere between 50 residents to 200 residents. It just, sometimes it just depends on \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, what the issues are, the big issues. But generally speaking at our meetings, it's individual residents as opposed to interest groups that come together as an advocacy group. \nSPEAKER_04:  Have you seen that change or are you still seeing more individuals come? \nSPEAKER_05:  So far this year we've been seeing more individuals. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  A great question is Vice Chair Yoronga. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you Chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_06:  I was very pleased at the turnout yesterday at the \nSPEAKER_06:  I think it would be very well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Of course, it was one that I had to have added because there were only three originally. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think that it's important that one thing that I noted at the meeting before was \nSPEAKER_06:  If you're going to do the four compass points. \nSPEAKER_06:  Gotta have Weston Beach. \nSPEAKER_06:  a significant community out there, 25,000 people cut off my freeway in a river. And I think it's important that they get as much attention as possible. \nSPEAKER_06:  And although we, it is not a... \nSPEAKER_06:  Continuous community in regard to the rest of the seventh district. \nSPEAKER_06:  It is a very important community nonetheless and it should be \nSPEAKER_06:  put it this way. Keep it on your radar for future events and future communications. \nSPEAKER_06:  One of the other things I noticed as well is that you also had a discussion not only about the budget itself with the committee members that were there. \nSPEAKER_06:  but you also wanted to have a discussion about the 2030 plan. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I think that took away a little bit from having a longer meeting. I don't know if you had your \nSPEAKER_06:  limited by time. \nSPEAKER_06:  But there were some members of the community who didn't feel they got their questions asked. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so they didn't have enough time because we basically... \nSPEAKER_06:  put it off like at five questions or six. I don't know how many to work. \nSPEAKER_06:  actually \nSPEAKER_06:  But I did get that feedback that I didn't get to ask my questions and move on to quickly into the 2030 plan and into these breakouts. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we have one meeting left. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have one. \nSPEAKER_06:  You might want to keep that in mind that you don't want to cut anybody off, but then again, you don't want to extend it further into longer than it needs to be. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh \nSPEAKER_06:  But having said that now. \nSPEAKER_06:  Was this... \nSPEAKER_06:  planned in terms of having inclusion of the 2030 plan in there. And is that 2030 plan going to also be discussed? \nSPEAKER_06:  in future budget meetings or discussions. \nSPEAKER_06:  whether it's here or next year or the year after. What's the plan for that? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, certainly committee member. That was something unique for this year as the city is currently engaging in developing the 2030 strategic plan. And so the plan currently, as I understand it, is that they are putting together a proposal and a plan with information that's going to come out to council in the fall, fall winter of this year. And so part of the strategy of outreach to the community was to see if we can create some synergy between the meetings that the different topics were having in terms of outreach to the community. So that was something unique for this year and we'll just be for this year. \nSPEAKER_06:  Just for this year. \nSPEAKER_05:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, so between now and the fall when you're planning to present this to City Council, are there going to be? \nSPEAKER_06:  very specific meetings regarding the 2030 plan and just in that context of itself. \nSPEAKER_06:  and will there be community meetings such as that without the budget? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, as I understand it, there actually have already been \nSPEAKER_05:  some outreach to the community separate from the budget process for the 2030 plan and I think they are looking at other opportunities to outreach to the community and this was just another way that they can have that touch point with the community. Since we as the city were already reaching out and coordinating and facilitating those meetings. Any additional information on that outreach we can get the city manager's office to provide that additional detail for you if that's something you're interested in. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, basically it appears that some community groups and organizations are going back into in-person meetings. \nSPEAKER_06:  We missed the last year, obviously 2020 was a blur. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the \nSPEAKER_06:  This would be an opportunity again to go into these community groups. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, there's a ton of community groups out there, so I'm not expecting that you will be going to all of them, but there should be a few key organizations in each district that you might want to make yourselves available to talk about the 2030 plan and get that input from each area because obviously \nSPEAKER_06:  different parts of the city had different viewpoints in terms of what they want to see for the city. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I'm hoping that the city management can organize some community meetings for the 2030 plan that will be very specific and just related to that. Even if it's a part of our broader agenda for that community group, at least make a presentation and have that dialogue. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you and I'll entertain a motion in a second to this report. But before we go to a vote, I'd just like to say that I had an opportunity to attend at least one of the community meetings thus far. \nSPEAKER_07:  was my intention to get to all of them, but I couldn't, unfortunately, but my experience at that meeting, I would leave it was the first district, second district, maybe fourth district meeting at MacArthur, at the library, Mark Twain Library, across the MacArthur Park. It was a pretty well attended, and presentation was, I think, a very efficient, it was good feedback, a lot of great questions, great community engagement. \nSPEAKER_07:  Council members \nSPEAKER_07:  sorrow and Alan were also in attendance there and then they had the outdoor setup for the 2030 plan which was a separate piece. You know I do agree I think the budget is the focal point and the priority here but I also understand that our staff is pressed and they haven't had that opportunity to have that \nSPEAKER_07:  I know engagement with our constituents. And so this was a great opportunity to kind of deal with, what, hit two birds with one stone, as you would say. And I thought it was just good, it's good to see community engagement again, right? Live in person, actual people engaged and caring about the direction that the city is going in, whether it be the budget or our future vision for the city. And so I'm encouraged, I was encouraged to see the engagement in itself. So with that, is there any public comment on the report? \nSPEAKER_07:  We're good. \nSPEAKER_07:  You don't have any public comment? Hearing none. \nSPEAKER_07:  Let's go to a vote. Members, cash a vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilor McBride. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, I-I. \nSPEAKER_03:  I share your manga. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're awesome. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that not working? \nSPEAKER_04:  Ar, ar un er, yn y hapus Batwch yn\u043a\u043e\u043d allaren mai patchiad NHS\u569f yma? \nSPEAKER_03:  Didn't come up.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_03:  such an important but massive three-year effort. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  On March 16th, 2021, ahead of most other cities in the country, the City Council approved the Long Beach Recovery Act to address public health and economic impacts and disparities of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  The 249 million in funding for the Long Beach Recovery Act comes from federal, state, and county grants that are meant to be spent over a three year period. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city's recovery plan invest funds into three targeted categories, including economic recovery. \nSPEAKER_03:  a healthy and safe community and securing our city's future. \nSPEAKER_03:  These strategic investments support forward thinking economic development, programming to stabilize the wellness of business owners and property owners. \nSPEAKER_03:  and allow the city the opportunity for better economic recovery and future revenue generation. \nSPEAKER_03:  The strategic investment also supports public health, basic needs, and support services to ensure the community is thriving, safe, and resilient with equitable access to resources and opportunities. \nSPEAKER_03:  The plan was developed to take in into consideration the community's feedback. \nSPEAKER_03:  through five economic equity studies and the feedback from over 30 listening sessions with over 350 community leaders and representatives. \nSPEAKER_03:  The first program area of the Long Beach Recovery Act is economic recovery, with a total investment of 64 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  The Economic Recovery Program area focuses resources on residents and businesses most impacted by the pandemic and on relaunching business sectors hardest hit by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  The goal of this program area is to promote recovery that strengthens revenue generation and leverages consumer spending to stimulate economic growth. \nSPEAKER_03:  The second program area of healthy and safe community invests a total of 108.5 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  The Healthy and Safe Community Program area focuses resources on addressing the underlying social determinants of health. \nSPEAKER_03:  and prioritizing basic needs and a mental and physical health of community members most adversely impacted by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  The goal of this program area is to provide access to resources and opportunities that allow the community to be thriving, safe and resilient. \nSPEAKER_03:  The third program area is securing our city's future at 76.7 million. \nSPEAKER_03:  securing our city's future program area is critical in helping the city be able to weather the next financial crisis by effectively allowing for restoration of depleted emergency and operating reserves. \nSPEAKER_03:  which were depleted as a result of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  Additionally, this program area helps temporarily solve a $30 million shortfall in the general fund. \nSPEAKER_03:  and maintains important existing city services that otherwise would need to be eliminated due to budgetary shortfalls in both the current fiscal year FY21 and the proposed budget year FY22. \nSPEAKER_03:  The goal of this program area is to ensure that the city is able to support the community through the next emergency or crisis by having strong emergency and operating reserves. \nSPEAKER_03:  The Long Beach Recovery Act continues to support the city's commitment to the framework for racial reconciliation. \nSPEAKER_03:  The development of the three program areas were grounded in equity to best address the historic economic and health inequities that have worsened due to COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_03:  and focuses resources on areas of the community most impacted by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  The program protects public health, launches a service sector economy. \nSPEAKER_03:  builds an economic foundation for economic inclusion and allows the next generation to compete in the modern economy. \nSPEAKER_03:  programs, excuse me, specifically the Long Beach Recovery Act programs provide support to implement actions outlined in the racial equity and reconciliation initial report. \nSPEAKER_03:  including youth academic programming at libraries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Youth Life Coaching and Mentoring. \nSPEAKER_03:  expansion of the BSA program for park activation. \nSPEAKER_03:  expanding the Long Beach Activating Save communities, interventionist team and high impact communities. \nSPEAKER_03:  A reentry pilot program pilot to integrate services for people reentering from incarcerated settings, economic empowerment zones, digital inclusion, mental health crisis pilots, and youth workforce development programs. \nSPEAKER_03:  Finally, many of the staff developing and implementing these programs serve as department equity champions or have participated in equity training. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the Office of Equity is leading the creation of Equity Criteria, which is a part of staff training in advance of finalizing the details of the Long Beach Recovery Act programs prior to implementation. \nSPEAKER_03:  With these immense funds comes immense responsibility, and we need to be intentional about how we develop and implement the Long Beach Recovery Act programs over the next three years. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city has learned a lot from quickly dispersing funds and services under the previous federal emergency care sector funding. And the intent here is to create programs that address the intersectional impacts that the pandemic has had on different communities. \nSPEAKER_03:  To do this successfully, programs designed using a collective impact approach, where programs are built upon existing council-adopted plans and are developed to be coordinated and mutually reinforcing. \nSPEAKER_03:  which supports lasting economic recovery and public health equity. \nSPEAKER_03:  Each program also seeks to avoid duplication of other federal and state programs to most effectively use city funds. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll now turn it over to Ruby for the following slides. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Meredith. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll begin by talking about the various funding sources of the Long Beach Recovery Act. These funding sources come from federal, state, and county grants. Initially, when City Council approved the Long Beach Recovery Act program, it was totaled or estimated to be a total of $235 million. Since then, there have been new allocations awarded to the city as well as a reduction in the American Rescue Plan Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  The adjustment to the ARPA, the American Rescue Plan Act, was $17.9 million. And I'll speak more to that here in the next slide. But we did have good news and received a new allocation for the Emergency Rental Housing Program, which was around two allocation. And currently this program has about over $51 million allocated to it. \nSPEAKER_05:  We actually had a new vaccination grant to for $2.7 million. And then the CDC had a new initiative that awarded the Health Department $7.7 million to address health disparities among high-risk populations. \nSPEAKER_05:  The ARPA adjustment was $17.9 million. Initially, we received an estimate that this allocation would be just under $154 million. However, when the Department of Treasury finalized its allocations to all government entities, it showed that we had a reduction of $17.9 million. \nSPEAKER_05:  And what this meant was that we had to go back and adjust the Long Beach Recovery Act programs that were identified as being funded by ARPA. \nSPEAKER_05:  The reduction methodology that was developed was intended to protect small programs and preserve all programs. And so with this in mind, all programs under $300,000 had no reduction. This reason being that we felt they would have a major implementation issues if they were reduced. \nSPEAKER_05:  For programs over 300,000 and under 2 million, they were reduced by 10%. And for those programs over $2 million allotted, they were reduced by 20%. \nSPEAKER_05:  We also had a major reduction to the category restoring our reserves by $6.5 million. In the March report approved by Council of this category, you have $78 million program to it with the reduction that is now a 71.5 million program allocation. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm going to focus on funding compliance specifically to ARPA. Being that ARPA is the largest allocation that the city has received and it has the most complex regulations to it. In receiving ARPA funds, the city is now required to demonstrate how it spends its money and how we will be compliant with ARPA requirements. As you can imagine, we are funding about 50 programs with ARPA. And we did receive the Department of Treasury document that outlines all the regulations, which is 150 page document called the interim final rule. \nSPEAKER_05:  This rule outlines all the compliance areas, reporting requirements, and such. And in implementing these programs, we know that there could be issues of non-compliance or possible ineligible costs in case of an audit. \nSPEAKER_05:  just because of the complexity of the regulations. \nSPEAKER_05:  and to minimize these audit issues and to ensure program flexibility, the city is using the indirect funding option, which is also in the interim final role. \nSPEAKER_05:  It is an eligible use that can be an approach used by the city if we can approve or determine that there was a lost and revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSPEAKER_05:  So how does this work? \nSPEAKER_05:  The regulation state that ARPA funds can be used on government services to the extent of revenue loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSPEAKER_05:  And the interim final rule document outlines the methodology to be used. This methodology is not based on budget practices or what the city would consider as revenue loss. It is actually a very specific application that if resulting in a revenue loss, the city could use our befundings in this method. \nSPEAKER_05:  In our preliminary calculations, we have determined that our revenue loss as a city would be over the $136 million dollar art by allocation, meaning that we could use the entire art by allocation for government services. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so what do we mean by government services? \nSPEAKER_05:  This would be study services that are normally funded by the General Fund. \nSPEAKER_05:  could be funded by Arpa. \nSPEAKER_05:  thereby generating savings in the general fund that would then be used to fund the Long Beach Recovery Act programs as approved by the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  This would allow flexibility in how we implement the programs and carry them out with the design and intent that they were initially developed. \nSPEAKER_05:  It would also mean that our audit risk of ineligible costs or compliance issues would be minimized. We have looked at the regulations for government services and they're really straightforward and easily met. \nSPEAKER_05:  In terms of what services we would use, we are looking at police services. \nSPEAKER_05:  The interim final rule specifically calls out police services, public safety services as an eligible government service. And being that police services are a large expense funded by the general fund. We could easily get to that $136 million funding allocation. \nSPEAKER_05:  We also have the processes in place that already show compliance and we could easily meet the requirements of ARPA as per the interim final rule. \nSPEAKER_05:  The next step is to submit a report to the Department of Treasury. This report is due by August 31. At that time, we will outline the use of this option and provide other information such as our revenue loss calculation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Of course, this is currently an interim final rule. It's not final and we expect to hear back from the Department of Treasury in a couple of months as to any changes to methodology or any other eligible use. And based on the information we have now, this is the approach the city will be taking, subject to any changes to the regulations or the requirements. \nSPEAKER_05:  And with that, I will turn it over back to Meredith. \nSPEAKER_03:  As you have seen from the amount of funding over three year period and the complexity. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  of the federal requirements. I want to acknowledge that the Long Beach Recovery Act is a massive initiative, needing proper care and planning to meet the moment and get it right for our community. \nSPEAKER_03:  254 million is an amount larger than the budget of many California cities and carries with it a significant lift to properly manage these federal dollars. \nSPEAKER_03:  To ensure appropriate program and financial management, the city has initiated a temporary three-year staffing plan focused on retaining the necessary human resources, setting up financial controls and developing collective impact programs to support Long Beach's recovery efforts. \nSPEAKER_03:  Properly and responsibly and minister in manage the Long Beach Recovery Act and all current and potential future funds Essential staff team has been established in the city manager's office an additional administrative and operational staff will be hired in phases of Programs are rolled out \nSPEAKER_03:  The administrative costs have been capped at 16% to maximize funding to the established programs while providing for the necessary administrative work. \nSPEAKER_03:  administrative costs. \nSPEAKER_03:  Include staff responsible for grant administration and grant writing, grants accounting and reporting, procurement and contractual services. \nSPEAKER_03:  hiring human resources, legal support, and enhancing technology tools and producing all aspects of the recovery website. \nSPEAKER_03:  Much of the staff work over the past month and continuing into the end of the fiscal year is focused on setting up the necessary financial and procedural framework to comply with federal funding guidelines, as well as training staff and developing our collective impact programs. \nSPEAKER_03:  All staffing associated with the Wombit Recovery Act is temporary for three years of program implementation due to the limitations of the one-time funding, so it's not to create a structural funding issue in future fiscal years. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well work is underway to set up the necessary structures to spend $254 million, excuse me, $249 million in three years. Certain critical programs have moved forward to serve the immediate need of the community. \nSPEAKER_03:  This includes the Long Beach Emergency Rental Assistance Program, the BizCare Program, and food security programs. \nSPEAKER_03:  Along Beach Rental Assistance Program opened applications in April of 2021, and assist land large and inculgable tenants or renters who have experienced financial loss or hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic through rental assistance. \nSPEAKER_03:  Assistance is available for income eligible tenants to pay rent and utilities both for past due bills and future payments. \nSPEAKER_03:  The program prioritizes assisting lower income tenants who have been unemployed for 90 days or more and who are at risk of housing instability. \nSPEAKER_03:  The program is established to provide assistance also to landlords, and tenants, and long beach, and is separate from the state's rental assistance program. \nSPEAKER_03:  Biscare program expansion began in November of 2020 to support small businesses but has been recently expanded to include a Biscare outreach team. \nSPEAKER_03:  This team are focused on helping small businesses located in low-to-moderate income areas of the city learn and benefit from small business grants, loans, technical assistance, and other resources. \nSPEAKER_03:  The BizCare Outreach team helps people learn about and apply for all the various programs to maximize the equitable distribution of those resources. \nSPEAKER_03:  For our food security programs, the city partners with numerous organizations to provide food and nutrition related services and support to populations experiencing high levels of food insecurity and or barriers. \nSPEAKER_03:  to healthy food access as a result of COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_03:  These food distribution events intended to reach neighborhood residents in need, while others are working specifically with pre-identified high priority populations. \nSPEAKER_03:  The city originally allocated 3 million in coronavirus aid relief and recovery, which is a CARES Act funding to support projects aimed at increasing food security and additional recovery act funding will continue these programs to ensure no gap in service. \nSPEAKER_03:  Development of other council approved programs is underway, and programs for business grants, quarter cleanups, and people experiencing homelessness are prioritized for implementation in the coming months. \nSPEAKER_03:  Appropriation of Recovery Funds for these and other future programs are included in the FY22 budget process. \nSPEAKER_03:  As the city moves into implementation of the Long Beach Recovery Act, all program information will be available on the city's website at www.longbeach.gov-forwardslashrecovery. \nSPEAKER_03:  This web portal is a one-stop location where information and resources will be available to the community and where the public can visit to see program announcements, funding applications, program details and eligibility and will report the city's progress on Recovery Act programs. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for your attention, budget oversight committee. Staff is available for any questions, and that concludes our presentation. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you for the very thorough report. \nSPEAKER_01:  Turn it over to my colleagues. Anybody? All right, with the vice chair, Yoronga. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Very good report. We're very lucky to have such a generous. \nSPEAKER_06:  contribution to the Sea of paths. \nSPEAKER_06:  Obviously, it helped us slap with the reserves. And of course, it actually \nSPEAKER_06:  in the long run, I think, it delays, but we know eventually is coming in 22, 23, which is... \nSPEAKER_06:  gives us time, I guess, to plan for that eventual. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh \nSPEAKER_06:  challenge that we're going to have when we come to 22-23. \nSPEAKER_06:  So saying that to the concern that I have is obviously with staffing. \nSPEAKER_06:  the staffing that you have now as a result of \nSPEAKER_06:  of ARPA is building a temporary staff to support this. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Eventually, I, you know, \nSPEAKER_06:  I am hoping that \nSPEAKER_06:  people who are working in those temporary bases. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm not going to be... \nSPEAKER_06:  That's a wrong way to put it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Let me put it another way. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm uh, I'm, I'm, I'm... \nSPEAKER_06:  hopeful that individuals who work. \nSPEAKER_06:  for us under ARPA, understand that it's a temporary. \nSPEAKER_06:  position for three years. \nSPEAKER_06:  You start to go more than that. \nSPEAKER_06:  So that expectations aren't going to be that there's going to be a full time position. \nSPEAKER_06:  at the end of the three years. \nSPEAKER_06:  So \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm looking at how can we strategically \nSPEAKER_06:  Feel these temporary positions internally. \nSPEAKER_06:  to create that savings that we were talking about, that you were talking about earlier. \nSPEAKER_06:  in regards to staffing. \nSPEAKER_06:  not feel positioned, so I'm keeping it on vacant. \nSPEAKER_06:  Perhaps we could do it through reassignments of \nSPEAKER_06:  of staff. \nSPEAKER_06:  from \nSPEAKER_06:  I wouldn't say that in critical because all positions are critical but \nSPEAKER_06:  from positions that could be \nSPEAKER_06:  uh \nSPEAKER_06:  redirected to serve in other areas that wouldn't have a major impact in their own department. \nSPEAKER_06:  to work temporarily on our related issues. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then at the end of the three year period, they were able to go back. \nSPEAKER_06:  to the original positions. \nSPEAKER_06:  hoping that that's in the plan somewhere along the lines. We're not hiring. \nSPEAKER_06:  new temporary employees. \nSPEAKER_06:  which could be a goal because we want people to be employed. \nSPEAKER_06:  given our \nSPEAKER_06:  future situation with staffing. \nSPEAKER_06:  uh \nSPEAKER_06:  having a salary savings for these those three years would be a tremendous help. \nSPEAKER_06:  to us in the future. \nSPEAKER_06:  So having said that, is there a plan for the temporary hiring of employees to assist us with all these various projects that we have here? And as well as \nSPEAKER_06:  where are those funds that are going to come from? Working with, for example, \nSPEAKER_06:  in the housing assistance program or in the \nSPEAKER_06:  vaccinations and those areas as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll chime in there. This is Grace. I think all of those things that you've mentioned, committee member, will all be things that the central management team will absolutely look at in terms of looking at are there reassignments and are there positions that we can pause in our current normal operating where staff can be reallocated? I think it does need to be looked at on a case-by-case basis just because there is this Long Beach Recovery Act program. It doesn't necessarily mean our current operations are stopping as well. So if staff are reassigned, there will likely be in many operations a need to backfill for those positions. But we would absolutely be looking to see, as you said, be very prudent to look to see are there those salary saving opportunities? So that would be looked at as well as looking at temporary, \nSPEAKER_04:  either consultants or temp positions and absolutely it would have to be clear in those situations that this is similar to grant funding and grant hiring that this is based on a one-time funding source and on a temporary basis. \nSPEAKER_06:  I-I-I-I- \nSPEAKER_06:  I haven't kept it up with the HR contract that we have with a manpower. I think it was an organization that we... \nSPEAKER_06:  contracted with for temporary employees. \nSPEAKER_06:  We still have contracts with the organizations like that personnel services, private contracts. \nSPEAKER_00:  a wilderness light! \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm not certain about the particular company that you've mentioned, but throughout the organizations, we do have different, in different departments, there may be different groups that different departments have contracts with, different temporary positions. And in terms of a central organization, we'd have to follow up with human resources. \nSPEAKER_06:  that I<|id|> \nSPEAKER_06:  Now some of these fundings obviously go beyond just temporary. \nSPEAKER_06:  there are \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_06:  not permitted, but quasi-permanent. The homelessness is an example. I mean, we're going to be using a lot of these opera fundings to address our homelessness challenges. And some of those challenges go beyond. \nSPEAKER_06:  the three-year plan that we have for that. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there going to be an opportunity, looking into your crystal ball, obviously, to determine what would be available after this to address some of these big issues that we have, such as our vaccination is going to be continuing? \nSPEAKER_06:  epidemiology is going to be continuing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ullgebraen Hongki-Kirfriend.\" \nSPEAKER_06:  as uh... \nSPEAKER_06:  continuing issue. \nSPEAKER_06:  Are we looking at how can we \nSPEAKER_06:  manage these fundings to get into something for the future for us, to be able to address these very compelling issues that we're facing right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, absolutely. I think part of, Emeritus might be able to speak to it more, but part of the use of the current Long Beach Recovery Act funds is to be able to leverage and be able to invest and find additional grant funding. So as much as we are able to continue to bring in more funds into the city, that's absolutely going to be prioritized and looked at. And committee member, the issue that you raised of \nSPEAKER_04:  the issues far outlasting the funding time period that we have is absolutely true. I don't think there's an easy answer for that. I think that's something we're as a city going to have to grapple with in the next couple years as we look at some of the challenges as you've mentioned with our shortfall. \nSPEAKER_04:  and looking at our resources and how we're going to balance the budget in the future. But it is something that we are very relieved to have at least for the next two to three years and to really pour into the community. But you're absolutely right. As we are doing that, concurrently, we're really going to need to be having those strategic discussions about resource allocations moving forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  You used to keep word that I don't have, you as a bunch of person wouldn't know it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ev'igine. \nSPEAKER_06:  Leveraging our money. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Vice Chair, Chair, if I may, just provide a brief response. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, Grace is absolutely right on the leverage funds, um, one of the recovery offices roles in addition to Citywide collaboration on program development is also grant writing, um, and providing that additional bandwidth, uh, in coordination for the different departments. Um, so just as a follow up to that, and I would offer vice chair also, uh, when on your hiring question, one of the big places we are plugged in is the Pacific Gateway workforce folks. Um, we really want to identify where we need have a need for staffing beyond what our current staff and employees can provide, um, is looking through the lens of Pacific Gateway, um, and some of the work LB efforts that they are undertaking currently and being able to identify, um, local residents who can fill some of those gaps to build that capacity locally. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Council Member Price. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Chair. So kind of along those lines, I wonder. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's been numerous areas that we've been able to pilot programs and address very systematically targeted. \nSPEAKER_02:  through the use of these relief dollars and \nSPEAKER_02:  As a result of that, we are seeing a lot of positive benefits by having those programs into place. \nSPEAKER_02:  such that my concern is what happens when that relief funding ends. \nSPEAKER_02:  And we realize that these programs that we started as a pilot or in response to a situation or \nSPEAKER_02:  because we had additional one-time funding to do are now at risk of going away. \nSPEAKER_02:  Are we planning for some sort of \nSPEAKER_02:  a prioritization or an reassessment. \nSPEAKER_02:  of where we're going to be when these funds expire. \nSPEAKER_02:  So that we are taking into account the value lost of those programs if we no longer have the money to fund them. \nSPEAKER_02:  and maybe reevaluating some of the traditional programs. \nSPEAKER_02:  and services we funded that are no longer as valuable if that makes any sense. \nSPEAKER_02:  It says still very soon to see, but I'm already starting to see with some of the one-time dollars. \nSPEAKER_02:  For example, I'll give you an one example in the area of public safety. \nSPEAKER_02:  because of the... \nSPEAKER_02:  addition of these one-time dollars. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're starting to see more foot patrols, for example, in certain business corridors. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that has a lot of positive impacts when we're talking about community engagement. \nSPEAKER_02:  building trust with the police and the community. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm seeing them out and about more on foot, not in a patrol car. \nSPEAKER_02:  Those kinds of benefits that we probably would not have had the money to fund, but for some infusion of really funds. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's just one. And we also have a lot of youth programming that we've been able to fund, a lot of health programming and health education. \nSPEAKER_02:  So what's that process going to look like? Is that going to be a process that city staff is hopefully going to lead us through as opposed to us having to figure out what priorities should be the priorities of the city based on? \nSPEAKER_02:  the welfare of the city as a whole. You know, sometimes we get into silos because we only know what we know. \nSPEAKER_02:  which oftentimes is limited to our geographic area. \nSPEAKER_02:  But you as city staff, you see things more broadly. \nSPEAKER_02:  So what's that process going to look like and how do you guys envision? \nSPEAKER_02:  taking the council along on that journey as we reevaluate priorities. \nSPEAKER_03:  In a member price, the way that we would do that would be through some of our traditional budget processes. I would show up in future discussions about the budget, but it will be very much grounded in a couple different data from a couple different areas. So the Long Beach Recovery Act on the website I mentioned in one of the last slides will have that progress report and it will include things in a dashboard for data like service delivery. \nSPEAKER_03:  metrics in terms of being able to say the number of meals served or number of people served number of business grants, etc. but will also include collective impact measurements. Looking at the longer term impact of some of these programs and the achievements of some of these programs. You will also have data and community priorities from the 2030 effort that is being led currently. And so a lot of those things will come together in the same time frame and will be available as part of your decisions as the B.O.C. and your decisions as part of the budget process. And as always staff is here to provide that data and support those processes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, that's great. I'm glad it's going to be a database approach because I know that sometimes when we've had to cut programs like after school care for example, it's really come down to numbers, how many students participate in this area. And so I think that database approach is really good because there's something to be said for access and making sure every district has the same thing but every district may not need the same thing. \nSPEAKER_02:  There may be programs that are taking advantage of heavily in one area and not in another. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so I want to make sure that we're being mindful about those decisions and not applying a one-size-fits-all throughout the city. It may be that, you know, walking beats are very, very beneficial in one area of town, but not in another because of the absence of business corridors, for example. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I just I look for guidance for cities. I'm looking for guidance from city staff as we go through that process and \nSPEAKER_02:  really hoping that the data helps shake policy and budget priorities moving forward. Because I do see a lot of great things happening with those relief funds and things that I think we all agree we would not have been able to do without those relief funds, especially post or during COVID. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I like to just weigh in a little bit as well. I mean, and I certainly support everything that has been shared by my colleagues, I have similar concerns. I'm pleased to hear that there's not much objection or in terms of how these funds are going to plan to be allocated. This is an, I appreciate the report. It was actually, I did a few times now, but it's always more information to better at SYNC San. I think, you know, it was referred to a couple times and we have more resources now than. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  We ever had. \nSPEAKER_01:  and I'm uh \nSPEAKER_01:  I want to be optimistic about expanding those resources in terms of the plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  I guess the question is, do we and are we ready? Do we have the capacity to deliver the services in the Recovery Act as planned? \nSPEAKER_01:  today. What do you think we are in terms of \nSPEAKER_01:  that capacity, that capability and \nSPEAKER_01:  And I know a lot of these resources are outside of the control of \nSPEAKER_01:  the city. A lot of it will be in-house and taking care of in the city, but some of it will be farmed out to community partners and nonprofit organizations. \nSPEAKER_01:  I want to have the confidence that those organizations are ready to take on this responsibility and deliver the services. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, that uh... \nSPEAKER_01:  that we intend to deliver. \nSPEAKER_01:  Have we put any provisions in place to ensure that that's going to be the case? I don't know. It's early in the process, but the question is. \nSPEAKER_03:  Chair, Chair Austin, there's a couple aspects to the answer to that question. Part of the importance of understanding this massive effort is really kind of fundamentally that we meet the moment and we do. \nSPEAKER_03:  We learn from CARES Act and we do it as necessary to provide for those who have been most impacted by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_03:  And part of that is establishing an internal governance structure, which will be led by the recovery office and getting the teams across the city and departments to be thinking collectively through that a collective impact approach and to be looking at things that are mutually reinforcing. So that's one aspect of being ready. \nSPEAKER_03:  The other aspect is what you heard from Ruby in terms of fully understanding the requirements of the funding from the U.S. Department of Treasury in a way that may change and may shift as they go from an interim role. \nSPEAKER_03:  with all of the provisions and requirements to a final rule. And very closely following that, so that we are not in jeopardy of giving money back at the end of the three years. \nSPEAKER_03:  The other aspect to this is going to be those collaborations with our community and our trusted community partners. We cannot do this alone. We do need the capacity of local CBOs, nonprofits, neighborhood associations, community groups, anywhere from feedback, which was undertaken during CARES Act as we were preparing for this effort and ongoing throughout the process. And being able to take advantage and think about capacity building as the funding is distributed to many of these groups. We have a very strong, \nSPEAKER_03:  population of CBOs and nonprofits in our community. We need to ensure that they understand the rules of accepting funding in a way that they can be successful. So that for us is something that is paramount of this effort. And then being able to use data successfully and communicating progress and telling the story of the impacts of some of these programs. So for your questions or that would be some of the elements of success. \nSPEAKER_01:  And because this is the budget oversight committee, I guess we're going to have some responsibility to actually have some oversight. I'm going to ask a question about accountability in terms of those resources that, like I mentioned, we won't be able to control. You mentioned that there could be audits. Who would be responsible for audits of these funds? \nSPEAKER_05:  can answer that. There would be multiple audits. Some of those audits are conducted by KPMG, which is the independent audit firm that audits the city every year, just regular and your financial audit. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  They also perform a federal audit every year. So that would be two audits. And then the Department of Treasury could also audit. \nSPEAKER_05:  And then the Office of Inspector General could also audit. And these audits could take place over a few years or they could all happen in the next fiscal year. \nSPEAKER_01:  Basically every government agency in the country would be subject to audit for the same bodies. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes, for this art ball allocation. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Chair, I will also offer that those US Treasury reports are, in fact, public and will be available on the Recovery website. That's part of our obligation and something that is a best practice. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I did want to kind of highlight that the recovery website that is going to be really a transparent area of transparency for people to look at. I'm encouraged to see that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much for your report. Are there any other comments from behind the wheel? \nSPEAKER_01:  Here we none. I didn't even public is there any public comment? Seeing none. Let's uh, let's vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilwoman Therese. \nSPEAKER_04:  I share your anger. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_04:  Fair Austin. All right. Ocean Carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe that concludes our agenda. Is there any public comment to on that?"
