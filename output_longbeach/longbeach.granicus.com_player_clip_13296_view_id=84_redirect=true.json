        "transcript": "SPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So the next item on our agenda is a presentation by Taylor. \nSPEAKER_05:  on the Fair Political Practices Commission in City of Long Beach, on Flickt of Interest, policies and code. Taylor. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon commissioners. \nSPEAKER_01:  We will get right into it. I have a PowerPoint presentation for you. We're waiting for it to load. \nSPEAKER_01:  Great. Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_01:  So an overview of the presentation today will cover the ethics handbook section on conflicts of interest, the city conflict of interest code, which we did cover next meeting so that will be more brief, and then the additional FPPC regulations on conflicts of interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  First, we'll cover the ethics handbook, which is the city's policy on conflicts of interest. Next slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  So overview, it includes what is a conflict of interest? How do I know if I have a conflict? What are the remedies for conflicts? How do I disqualify myself if I have a conflict of interest? And what is a conflict of interest code? I would like to note two before I continue. I did email you a memorandum that included all of these policies that are being covered today. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can do it myself. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm used to being virtual. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, look at that. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what is a conflict of interest? You have a conflict of interest if your public actions is a city official employee or board member, which includes city council members, commission members and committee members, affects your personal financial interest or the interest of your immediate family members. It does not matter whether the action has a negative or positive effect on the interest. Therefore, state law prohibits you from making, participating and making, or attempting to influence any government decision. If it is reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material effect on any of your economic interests or those of your immediate family members. \nSPEAKER_01:  So state law prohibits you from being financially interested in any constate contract. If your duties call on you to participate in any way, or at any stage of the approval process of the contract, any participation, including discussion in the process, which by which such a contract is developed, negotiated, or excluded, is a violation of law. \nSPEAKER_01:  For employee participation in the city procurement process, when acting as a representative of the city in a request for proposal, RFP is there more colloquially known, or an invitation to bid, ITB, or other procurement process for goods, equipment, or services, city employees are prohibited from using or allowing the use of their name and position to promote, endorse, or potentially benefit, a company doing business with the city. This does not prohibit an employee from conducting or providing reference checks or obtaining background information on bidders or proposes in city procurement. \nSPEAKER_01:  How do I know if I have a conflict? \nSPEAKER_01:  It can be difficult to determine whether you have a legal conflict of interest pursuant to state law. Therefore you should always contact the city attorney's office if a question arises. Remember that if you are married, one half of your spouse's income is deemed to be your income. Therefore if your spouse has any of the interest described above, you will have a conflict of interest. The city attorney will work with you to determine if you have a conflict pursuant to city or state law and to determine whether you must disqualify yourself. \nSPEAKER_01:  Please note that the mere presence of one of the interests listed does not necessarily mean that you have a conflict. Since other factors may be involved, there are any questions you should consult with the City Attorney's Office. So on this point too, conflict of interest analysis are usually very fax-specific, which is why we're recommending that staff and city officers contact our office. \nSPEAKER_01:  How do I know if I have a conflict? You may have a conflict of interest if you were an officer, director, partner, employee, trustee or manager of a company or business before your department or board. You have an investment of $2,000 or more in a company with business before your department or board. You have an interest in real property of $2,000 or more that, and that real property is the subject matter of an item before your department or board. This includes leasehold interest that are no longer than month to month tenancy. Tenancies. \nSPEAKER_01:  You own or lease an interest in real property that's located within 500 feet of a property, which is the subject matter of a decision before your department or board. An interest in real property does not include a month to month tenancy. \nSPEAKER_01:  you will receive any income which totals 500 or more within within the prior 12 months from a person or entity with business before your department or board. Income includes loan or forgiveness of indebtedness. \nSPEAKER_01:  You receive a gift or gifts totally $500 or more within the prior 12 months. From a personal entity with a business before you department or board, gifts include rebates, discounts, free meals, free tickets or travel. \nSPEAKER_01:  if you are someone. \nSPEAKER_01:  that is the source of income to you. \nSPEAKER_01:  meaning $500 or more within prior 12 months is the subject of a proceeding before your department or board. And then as a result of a decision before your department or board, your personal finances or those of your immediate family will either increase or decrease in any manner. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what are the remedies for conflicts? \nSPEAKER_01:  If a conflict of interest exists, you must be disqualified, meaning that you must abstain from making, participating, and making, discussing, or attempting to use your official position in any way to influence government decision, the government decision that might affect your personal interest. If you're a council member or a planning commissioner, you must also leave the room while the issue is being discussed. So for staff, they basically recuse themselves from whatever the project is, and stop working on it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Again, City Attorney's Office will provide advice concerning the existence of a conflict and if disqualification is required, further there are circumstances when your entire board may be disqualified. \nSPEAKER_01:  Please be aware that severe penalties may result for you in the city if you do not abstain wear appropriate. \nSPEAKER_01:  How do I disqualify myself if I have a conflict of interest? If disqualification on a meeting agenda item is required, you must publicly disclose the interest, which is the subject of the potential conflict, as well as the fact that you are disqualifying yourself from any participation in the decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  The disclosure may be made orally at the public meeting and are unwriting to a board secretary must be made to part of the agency's official records, meaning the minutes of the meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this part of the handbook leads then into the conflict of interest code, which we covered at the last meeting. This is the portion of the handbook that covers that for staff, which is different than the presentation that I gave you, which was more of an overview. Includes similar information, but in a quick digestible enough format for staff that they understand why it's important. So the conflict of interest code is a set of rules and regulations adopted pursuant to California's political reform act. Each conflict of interest code designates position required to file a statement of economic interest, more commonly known as the form 700. \nSPEAKER_01:  and assigns and disclosures categories specifying the types of interest to be reported. \nSPEAKER_01:  The types of interest you must disclose, depend on the responsibilities of your designated position. The disclosure requirements may include important investments. Excuse me one second. \nSPEAKER_01:  My apologies, I had a tickle in my throat. The disclosure of requirements may include the reporting of investments, business positions, interest in real property, income and financial interest, as we covered in the last meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  The city does not have specific categories. If someone is required to disclose and file form 700, they have the maximum level of disclosure required for all city departments. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that goes into the city conflict of interest code. \nSPEAKER_01:  for the sake of the new commissioner. I'm going to go through it quickly. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as I said before, it's required by the California political reform act. So it must reflect the current structure of the organization and properly identify officials, employees, and consultants who required to file the form 700. And \nSPEAKER_01:  The departments are required to review their conflict of interest code at least every even number year The role of the city clerk's office in this case is to facilitate \nSPEAKER_01:  communicate and educate the city departments on this process. \nSPEAKER_01:  The code identifies what financial interest must be disclosed on the form 700. As I said before, currently all city employees are required to report all categories on their form 700. \nSPEAKER_01:  The FBPC requires departments are notified that they must review their CLI codes. Buy July 1st, 2022, and then approved by City Council by October 3rd of this year. \nSPEAKER_01:  The FBPC also offers training for employees tasked with creating or amending their agency's code, including how to adopt and amend the analysis of the disclosure categories, how to designate positions, and how to assign categories to those positions. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the FPPC recommends the following considerations when reviewing a conflict of interest code. \nSPEAKER_01:  is the code more than five years. Have there been any substantial changes to the department's organization structure since the code was adopted? Have any new, any positions been eliminated or renamed since the current code was adopted? Have any new positions been added since the current code was adopted? \nSPEAKER_01:  Have there been any substantial changes in duties or responsibilities for any position since the current code was adopted? And if you answer yes to any of these questions, most likely it will need to be amended. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here's a sample of what it looks like to actually amend the code. \nSPEAKER_01:  included in the memorandum that I sent you, I believe last week, I gave you a copy of the complete code for the entire city. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was mistaken. I thought it was available online. I'd apparently it is not, so that's why it's, but it is a public record. It's just, it is not available online. \nSPEAKER_01:  So per year request, we worked with the city clerk's office who generously offered to request an annual review of the conflict of interest codes after budget adoption, which is roughly about September of every year. \nSPEAKER_01:  before the clerk sends annual notice to the FBBC in January. \nSPEAKER_01:  This will allow the commission to participate in the process with the departments in October and November on an annual basis. Depending on the desire of this commission, the departments can either submit TFFs, which is a form of memorandum, to the commission, or they can give quick presentations about the changes to their codes and why the changes occurred. \nSPEAKER_01:  This will allow the commission to provide feedbacks on the COI codes and it will be on an annual basis. \nSPEAKER_01:  So now we're moving on to the FPPC conflicts of interest. There are two specific sections that the FPPC uses to regulate. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  the Political Reform Act and the Government Code Section 1090. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to start with the Political Reform Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  So with... \nSPEAKER_01:  All of these different regulations, I would, I try to think of them as buckets, right? Each type of conflict of interest has its own little bucket and universe of rules that pertain to it. \nSPEAKER_01:  So under the Political Reform Act, it prohibits a government official at any level of state or local government for making, participating and making, or attempting to use the official's position to influence a governmental decision, in which the official knows or has reason to know the official has a financial interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  The official has a financial interest if it's reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material effect on one or more of the official's interests as identified and distinguishable from the decisions effect on the public generally. A lot of these terms in the Political Reform Act will be familiar to you because we just covered these same concepts in the city's employee handbook for ethics. \nSPEAKER_01:  taken together, these provisions of the act prohibit an official from taking part in a decision if it's reasonably foreseeable that the decision will have a material financial effect on one or more of the official's financial interest identified in the act distinguishable from the decisions effect on the public generally. \nSPEAKER_01:  So there are elements to determine if a conflict of interest exists. This is what my office uses when we have to do an analysis of whether there is a conflict. \nSPEAKER_01:  So \nSPEAKER_01:  It's making or participating and making or attempting to influence a decision, financial interest, foreseeability of financial effect, materiality standards, the public generally exception, legally required participation, segmentation, and disqualification requirements. \nSPEAKER_01:  So making participating and making are attempting to influence a decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  An official is making a decision if the official authorizes directs any action, votes, a point to person, obligates or commits the official agencies. \nSPEAKER_01:  the officials agency to any course of action or enters into any contractual agreement on behalf of the agency. \nSPEAKER_01:  they are participating in the decision if the official provides information without a \nSPEAKER_01:  It provides information and opinion or a recommendation for the purpose of affecting the decision without significant. \nSPEAKER_01:  intervening substantive review. \nSPEAKER_01:  an official uses their official position to attempt to influence the decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  If the official contacts or appears before, any official in the official's agency or in an agency subject to the authority or budgetary control of the official's agency for the purpose of affecting a decision, any official and any other government agency with the purpose of affecting a decision, and the official reports to act within the authority or on behalf of the official agency in making the contact. \nSPEAKER_01:  So exceptions to making in participating and making are tempting to influence a decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  The decision is ministerial. \nSPEAKER_01:  It includes actions that are solely ministerial, secretarial, or clerical. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those are the decisions where. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is, it's a yes or no, is the best way that I can put it. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is no discretion used in making the decision either is or it is not. Like a lot of the paperwork that's submitted to the clerk for the election purposes, it's minute stereo. \nSPEAKER_01:  Is the information present or is it not present? Is it the form complete or is it not? \nSPEAKER_01:  appearance by an official. \nSPEAKER_01:  as a member of the general public. \nSPEAKER_01:  If the appearance is before an agency. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the course of its government function, if the official is appearing on matters related solely to the official's personal interest. So we talked about this with... \nSPEAKER_01:  Actually, we've talked to this a lot about our disclosure policy, the ability to speak with council members and the mayor about, you know, hey, the trash trucks aren't coming in my neighborhood, right? That is you coming to them as a resident, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  It includes real interest and real property or business owned controlled by the official members of the officials immediate family or the official. \nSPEAKER_01:  members of the officials and media family. \nSPEAKER_01:  terms of employment, actions related to the officials' compensation or terms and conditions of their employment or consulting contract. \nSPEAKER_01:  or public speaking, so communications buy an official to the public or the media. \nSPEAKER_01:  I am not sick. My throat became very dry when I started this presentation, so I apologize. \nSPEAKER_01:  So additional exceptions, academic decisions, teaching decisions or decisions by an official who has teaching or research responsibility at an institution of higher education, relating to their professional responsibilities. \nSPEAKER_01:  Architectural and Engineering Documents. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then additional consulting services. \nSPEAKER_01:  So this list provided here of disqualifying conflicts of interest is the same one that I just ran over in the ethics handbook. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the foreseeability of the financially effect must be explicitly involved. \nSPEAKER_01:  The financial effect on a financial interest is presumed to be reasonably foreseeable. If the financial interest is explicitly involved in the decision, an official financial interest is quote-unquote explicitly involved. \nSPEAKER_01:  and a decision if the interest is a named party in or the subject of the decision. An interest in the subject of a proceeding, if the decision involves the issuance renewal, denial, revocation of any license permit or other entitlement. \nSPEAKER_01:  or contract with the interest. Additionally, an official's real property interest is explicitly involved. \nSPEAKER_01:  and any decision affecting the real property. \nSPEAKER_01:  So when an official financial interest is not explicitly involved in a decision, the financial effect of the decision is reasonably foreseeable if the effect can be recognized as a realistic possibility in more than a hypothetical or theoretical possibility. The effect needs to be reasonably foreseeable. \nSPEAKER_01:  I mean, also included the factors that are considered when determining if the decision's effect on an official is not explicitly involved in the interest is reasonably foreseeable. \nSPEAKER_01:  materiality standards. \nSPEAKER_01:  The regulations, meaning FPPC regulations, provide that the next step in the analysis is to determine if the decisions reasonably foreseeable financial effect on the officials' financial interest is actually material. The officials' interest, this means the officials' interest is in. \nSPEAKER_01:  A business entity, real property, source of income, source of gifts or gifts. Their personal finances are those of the family. And then the materiality standard in the code of regulations will then be applied. This standard that's applied is dependent on which interest that the official has. \nSPEAKER_01:  and where I didn't include all of those. \nSPEAKER_01:  There is an exception for the public generally. If a decision of a financial effect on an official's interest is indistinguishable from the decisions effect on the public generally, the officials not disqualified from taking part in the decision. \nSPEAKER_01:  So as a general rule, the decision, it decisions financial effect on official. \nSPEAKER_01:  officials financial interest is indistinguishable from its effect on the public generally, if the official establishes that a significant segment of the public is affected, and the effect on the official's interest is not unique compared to the effect on the significant segment. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  There are also specific rules for special circumstances that you're outlined here, providing examples of the different types of things that would be deemed to be indistinguishable from the public's interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the prohibition and the act does not prevent an official from making or participating in the making of a decision to the extent that the official's participation is legally required for the action or decision to be made. \nSPEAKER_01:  So a tied vote does not make the disqualified officials participation legally required. \nSPEAKER_01:  Legally required participation includes participation is allowed only if there exists no alternative source of a decision consistent with the purposes in terms of Statue authorizing the decision \nSPEAKER_01:  A lot of cases this will be a quorum. There's not enough members to make a quorum, so someone would need to participate that would normally be disqualified. \nSPEAKER_01:  It also requires that it's narrowly construed. \nSPEAKER_01:  and specifically provides that the regulations will not be construed to prevent official who is otherwise disqualified under the act to break a tie vote. And to allow a member of an agency who is otherwise disqualified under the act to vote if a quorum can be convened of other members of the agency who are not disqualified. \nSPEAKER_01:  whether or not those members are actually present at the time of disqualification. \nSPEAKER_01:  segmentation. An agency may segment a decision in which the official has a disqualifying conflict of interest to allow the official to participate in associated decisions, which would not have disqualifying effect on the official's interest under the act subject to certain conditions. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the act requires the disqualified official to identify the potential conflict of interest, to publicly identify the official's financial interest or interest issue, recuse from voting, discuss or attempt to influence the matter, and leave the room until the matter is concluded. \nSPEAKER_01:  The FVPC also has further direction and guidance on how to recuse and who is disqualified from the agenda and how the item is noticed under the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, last section, government code section 1090. \nSPEAKER_01:  This section prohibits an officer in employee. \nSPEAKER_01:  from. \nSPEAKER_01:  entering into our participating and making contracts in which they have a financial interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  Members of the legislature, state, county, judicial, district, city, officers, and employees should not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any board or boards with their members. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now shall any of these jurisdictions or city officers or employees be purchasers of any sale or vendor? \nSPEAKER_01:  and any purchase made by them in their official capacity. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is intended to not only strike an actual impropriety, but strike the appearance of impropriety. The prohibition applies even when the terms of the proposed contract are demonstrably fair and equitable or are plainly fair to the public's advantage. Prohibition must be broadly construed and strictly enforced. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the FPPC has authorized issue opinions or advice, first and subject to this government code. They're prohibited from issuing an opinion or advice where it relates to past conduct. So any time that we submit opinions to them, it's always for problems that are up and coming. \nSPEAKER_01:  violations under this section are subject to criminal penalties. If the violation is willful, including a prismate disqualification from holding public office in perpetuity. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then administrative and simple penalties by the FBC, if the violation is by a public official who violates this prohibition against being financially interested in contract. \nSPEAKER_01:  or who causes another person to violate the prohibition. Only upon written authorization from the district attorney of the county, in which the alleged violation occurred. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's a six set process for the government code section 1090 analysis. The terms are out late out here. \nSPEAKER_01:  So just for your assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  The differences between the Political Forum Act and the Government Code Section 1090. \nSPEAKER_01:  Because on their face, they sound a little bit similar as you're going through it. So the Political Reform Act prevents, prohibits a public official at any level or state or local government from making, participating or attempting to use their position to influence a government decision in which the official knows or has reason to know that they have a financial interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  Public-evisional means every member, officer, employee, consultant of a state or local government agency. So government code section 1090. \nSPEAKER_01:  per-habit city officers or employees from entering or participating in contracts specifically in which they have a financial interest. \nSPEAKER_01:  And that concludes my presentation. I'm available for questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  vice chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, I appreciate that. Um, so you went through the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ethics Handbook and we've also been provided with the city's ethics guide both of which have complex mentor sections \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Good to know. Thank you. And the handbook Turks talks about this as the conflict of interest policy. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, but it's not an AR. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  It is not an AR, but I do believe it is adopted by the Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  So, but... \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, so ARs are specific to, they're specifically issued by the City Manager. \nSPEAKER_01:  The ethics handbook is something that is drafted by my office. \nSPEAKER_01:  We don't have the authority as an elected official and not being the city manager to issue an AR to dictate. \nSPEAKER_01:  Citywide, what employees do, which is why it's adopted by the Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  So is there a way to reflect that for employees of the city so they understand that this has the force and effect of an AR violation of which could result in termination. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's something that I can look into. I believe if you were violating one of the policies for conflict of interest, I don't believe I know. If you were violating one of the quote unquote policies, you'd actually be violating state law. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so that would be, that would be what the employee would be disciplined for, not violation necessarily of the handbook. The purpose of the handbook is to provide employees a digestible version of the state code. You know, that, that's a lot of information to get through, right, for staff. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  which is why it's broken down in the way that it is so that they can understand what their legal requirements are. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that was my other question. This does not go beyond state law. \nSPEAKER_04:  No. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_05:  Mr. Feetler. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, really briefly. Thank you first off for putting that together. I had just a quick question and if it has been covered in a previous presentation or in the attachments that you provided last week and I missed it, I apologize. I am curious if there is any sort of attempt by the city to define and regulate conflicts of interest that do not necessarily focus on the financial interest as we saw it defined in the various policies and instead focus on, for example, personnel based conflicts of interest. Some of the definitions I saw of what kind of constitutes a financial interest so as to create a conflict of interest are fairly broad but as I digested the material, it seemed like everything focused on contracts, your procurement and interests and businesses and real property, etc. I am curious if there is anything that applies both to just regular city employees and elected officials and council members, etc. that attempts to regulate hiring decisions at the city to use an example if a city council member has a nephew applying to a job in the city. Is there anything currently on file that attempts to create disclosures or abstaining whenever a person has a position of influence over that hiring decision and some friend or family member may be applying to a position in the city? \nSPEAKER_01:  So we do have a presentation actually per Commissioner shot wells request. \nSPEAKER_01:  and in continuation of this to cover the rest of the conflict of interest policies. \nSPEAKER_01:  Most of those from what I understand are ARs. I have not fully collected all of them for you, but to the extent there are other policies, we have another presentation scheduled to catch the rest of them so that you guys have had the full gamut of conflict of interest. I do know off the top of my head there is an epitism policy about hiring family. \nSPEAKER_01:  off the top. I'm not as familiar with the rest of the ARs, but we will cover that in a subsequent meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  That was originally scheduled for this month, and hindsight probably would have been better if we'd gone forward with it. But our calendar was so full, and we had so many things. We decided to push that over to September. \nSPEAKER_07:  Totally, totally. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you for the comprehensive presentation. And up until the last discussion or last meeting, reading through and preparing for this meeting and then your presentation today, I really didn't understand. \nSPEAKER_08:  that we have Some of the complexities associated with where the city has its requirements or where it's taking its requirements from First of all to Mr. Field or Commissioner Fielders on you know question when you're just when we're talking about that next month Or the next couple of months with regard to nepotism in hiring I'm going to look at hiring and supervision You know it's not just family members but close personal relationships any guidance you the city has on that Which may even be a close financial relationship and then I In Commissioner Dave and addictive often will kind of refer to these separately, but Which I appreciate because I think that's how most people think about it is gift mills and entertainment or groutuities Which I think you were also planning to address \nSPEAKER_01:  We had covered that previously with the GIFS AR. \nSPEAKER_01:  It was, I believe, combined with a few other policies. I can resend that to you, if you'd like. But there is a gift policy. It is covered in the employee handbook, and there is an AR on point for that one. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I think I have that what I'm looking for and this kind of really gets to my main point is We have and maybe make sure I understand it we have a policy handbook the policy handbook I think is outlining very the various different state regulations that can apply to an employee or that \nSPEAKER_01:  Most of them, it does interweave the ARs that are applicable to staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  What I can do is I realize now that we're having this conversation is that we've been peacemailing, I think, the employee, the ethics handbook to you. I can send you a copy of it so you guys can see the full picture of what it is. I'm not sure that you've actually received that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  we actually have. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think most of us did, but if we could make sure some of those documents in your previous presentation goes to our newest commissioner so they can mark you some up to speed, that would be great. \nSPEAKER_04:  It probably also ought to be on the resources page because finding things for employees to find things like that is difficult. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the employees have what's called the intranet. The intranet is an internet specific to the city. You have to be logged on to the city's network to access it. A can of test, it is fairly organized. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those policies are on the landing page. They have their own drop down for city employees defined including other resources and information for all the departments. So for city employees, it is a lot maybe easier for them to access. Like I said, it's on the it's a header on the landing page of the internet. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  So, and I believe they may be given this information to when \nSPEAKER_01:  They are on board, there's a new employee presentation that they, an orientation that they all go to. \nSPEAKER_08:  So, and then we have the, what is typically referred to as a code, which I think is now primarily drip the, the language there are enuminclature there is primarily driven by the FPPC, because that is very specific on what you have to file with the FPPC, is that correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  So by conflict of interest code, you're referring to who in the city is required to file the form 700. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, that's very specific to the FPPC regulation. So when we're referring to the conflict of interest code, we're specifically referring to those employees that have been, their position has been designated as people in the city under the FPPC's regulations that are required to file form 700. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. My concern is, I mean, I appreciate what's been done to distill it down into the handbook. I also appreciate the limitations of the city attorney's office has in terms of what they can put out there that's kind of required by the city. But what I'm looking for is how do we make it relatively easy, kind of really distilling it down for the elected, let alone the employees, because you've got it, we have it, a lot of material presented in a variety of different places as opposed to really kind of distilling it down to something that's really easy to see what is allowed and what's not allowed. We have it. And I believe what you're saying is that the handbook is attempting to do that, but we still have all these other \nSPEAKER_08:  sources out there which I can appreciate. But is there a way that the city can actually distill it down and say, we've taken from the state requirements and we've taken our own requirements and we're going to distill it down into this is our policy, what you have to do and you really should focus on this. This is what you're focusing on in terms of to avoid the even of the appearance of a conflict of interest as opposed to kind of going to a variety of different sources. \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe that's where you guys come in. \nSPEAKER_01:  and training program for staff and the training program for the elected of like \nSPEAKER_01:  If that's what you think would be beneficial or a recommendation on how the city can improve this process would be very meaningful. Because I \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm not sure that anybody has really taken an overhaul view of all of these different things. This is the best effort of the city to make sure that our employees are complying with the policies. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Like I said, my office can only do so much from the position that we're in, which is why the handbook is very legally based. Because they're legally required, that's our lane. So \nSPEAKER_01:  If this commission can make a recommendation on \nSPEAKER_01:  how that can be improved. We're definitely open to those suggestions. We want nothing more than staff and the elected officials to follow these laws as well with the understanding, of course, like this is all very complicated, right? So, \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, this would be a great space for this commission to make a recommendation. \nSPEAKER_08:  and fair enough because my question was probably more geared towards what I'm going to be looking for in the future and I absolutely agree with you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  A quicky Russian \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate that you're going to be making a presentation on any of the rules in the city relating to nepotism. Could you also address at that time whether there are any rules on cronyism? \nSPEAKER_04:  the term basically going beyond family in other words if I'm making a if I make a decision to hire my best buddies daughter no financial interest to me no familial interest to me and whether or not there are any rules in the city that address the conflict of interest where someone may be biased based upon personal relationships other than immediate family. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will look into that and include it if it does exist. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Maybe to make that presentation more comprehensive April, we should have HR come to talk about civil service rules because I'm presuming that civil service rules here are the same as most government organizations and that you have to have a list of qualified candidates. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then you pick from within the list. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it's not as easy as just bringing in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Although, for those concerned, you are correct. Acting or any of these other decisions that are subject to the conflict of interest rules that my interest may not be a personal financial interest. It may be, you know, it's sorry, the old boys' club. \nSPEAKER_04:  what rules does the city have to avoid the old boys club from hiring contractors, you know, who are my best buddy and or making any decisions based upon who I swim with in the morning, whose kids, you know, hang out with my kids. \nSPEAKER_04:  that kind of thing. \nSPEAKER_01:  So from a contracting standpoint, I think that that's where competitive procurement comes in. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? Where the city is looking. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have a fiduciary duty. We're using taxpayer dollars where \nSPEAKER_01:  We're legally obligated to do. \nSPEAKER_01:  right by the people and use their money appropriately. So that's why we have competitive procurement policies. \nSPEAKER_01:  try to get the best deal in all the instances that we can. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  I do think there's a lot of rules, but to be honest with you, the perception of a lot of people I meet is that in this city it's who you know. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So how do we counter that perception with information that says, no, here is, \nSPEAKER_04:  Here are the ways that we make decisions in contracting and hiring and this in that and by the way it's inappropriate to be making those decisions on the basis of \nSPEAKER_04:  personal relationships. You're right. We do have a variety of mechanisms that should counter that perclivity, but it would be nice if we also had something that actually said \nSPEAKER_04:  that this is to ensure that it's not who you know. \nSPEAKER_04:  that it's uh... \nSPEAKER_04:  a fair and objective process in all of these different decisions. \nSPEAKER_01:  This solution to that may be public education. \nSPEAKER_01:  Right? Because I'm not sure the public is aware to the extent of the extreme procurement maker and the effort that the extreme effort that that department is doing to make sure that we are as fair as possible. So \nSPEAKER_01:  It's something we can definitely bring back for you. And then to the point on civil service, you're correct. We do have positions in the city, though, where \nSPEAKER_01:  Like I'm not a civil service position. I'm at will right and so Let higher up in the city you get also those positions are at will positions. They don't go through the civil service process \nSPEAKER_04:  There are also a lot of junior positions that for reasons I can't understand are not civil service. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's outside the scope of my knowledge, but I think HR would be more appropriate to speak to that, but just to acknowledge what we were discussing about earlier. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think HR would be more. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm also to discuss on the procurement. \nSPEAKER_00:  Anybody involved in the competitive procurement process from the city staff side, whether you're on an RFP panel or ITB, you're required to sign a complicated interest form and have that on file before you are able to even look at. \nSPEAKER_00:  any of the proposals, so there's that for procurement. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then any classified position in the city that's protected by civil service is Goes through them for the entire certification of the list job bulletin all of that and there are seasonal non-FTE Temp positions that are not qualified Or do not get classified under civil service and then any management or I believe elected official office \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks. A couple of points or questions that I have. One on the issue of how we make this simpler or how we incorporate into education and education program, which I know we're working to develop. I think there's a lot of things here that just call out for hypotheticals. And I could, I mean, I rose down questions that I would have about how certain of these principles would apply to myself or I can think of a situation where I think there could be a question. And it seems like that if the education program \nSPEAKER_03:  incorporated some examples, real life examples, then I think that would help people start people that are in the positions that need to think about whether they have a conflict, recognize one or not. One of the questions I'll just say that does come up periodically is a lot of people that are involved in the city either as employees or as members of commissions or electeds or whatever are also involved in nonprofits. So then if you were to come and speak at a... \nSPEAKER_03:  at a meeting about the importance of that nonprofit, is that a problem or it isn't not a problem? And is that different how it applies to a city council member as how it applies to a member of a commission? I think there's a lot of people in the city that would want or could use clarity on that point. So that's just an example of a question that I think could be presented in different ways to get people to think about really what their actions are and what the effect of them could be. The other thing, well, first I have a question, I guess, is for Taylor. So as I understand it, I thought I heard you say that the ethics rules that we have in the city are not broader than they're not in any way more restrictive than the state law requires. Is that right? \nSPEAKER_01:  So as they pertain to conflicts of interest specifically. \nSPEAKER_01:  They are aligned with state law. \nSPEAKER_01:  There are policies that are reflected in the ethics handbook that do reflect city manager regulations, the ARs. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those may be more restrictive than state law. They may be more consistent with state law. Off the top of my head, I can't speak to that. But as they pertain to the conflict of interest code specifically, it's what's outlined in the fair, the FPPC's regulations under the \nSPEAKER_01:  political reform act. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then we also have the contracting provisions in government code 1090. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  So for this portion of conflict of interest, it specifically relates to state code, where I think that there is concern by this commission from what I'm hearing of. There are other instances where conflicts may arise that aren't particularly being addressed, and there's not policies here. \nSPEAKER_01:  But that goes back to my office is making sure that everybody for this section complies with state law and the legal requirements if this commission has suggestions on policies for conflicts of interest beyond that. I think once you get the final piece of the presentation of comprehensively what the conflict of interest areas are for the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  That recommendation is something that can definitely be considered. \nSPEAKER_03:  Another question I have or comment is if there's something like a thousand people that are required to file the 700 forms, I think it's a large number of people, right? \nSPEAKER_01:  The clerk can speak to the exact number, but it is a fair number of people in the city that are expected to file them. \nSPEAKER_03:  expected. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, it's between 900-something people who file. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, okay. Well, of those, I think the only ones that we have posted, and maybe I didn't look all the places, and I'm supposed to look, but you know, on the City Clerk's website, for example, you can go to the 700 filings, and you can get the 700 filings for the electeds and a few other people. You can't get them for all 1,000 people. And I mean, just by name or whatever. And one, when we start thinking about procurement, I think we should also think about whether there are other positions in the city that we think it would make sense to have their 700, you know, easily available. I understand you can get it by request for information or whatever. And anyway, I think that's something we might want to consider recommending or suggesting be done, because I don't know what rules might govern whether it can be posted or not, but it seems like it's a public document. We could recommend at least that those public documents be posted, because I think that would, I think in the procurement area, especially that perhaps some high level positions in the city manager would be ones where it would make sense if people could easily see where the gifts were that were coming from, that officials were receiving, for example. So that's a thought for a potential recommendation down the line after we get all this information. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that's it. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sure it did benefit this. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Really appreciate the \nSPEAKER_02:  the briefing I think it was one of the reading for you. We read it well before, but good job on that. I do look forward to seeing the other presentations because when I think of an organization and I appreciate that we have a legal lane, but I look to our ethics officer. We've got to catch all the white space that is deals with the budgetary, the administrative, all the other types of conflicts of interest that exist in an organization. I think it's a personal being one of the largest probably. When I think of the draft of the Code of Conduct, it is the perfect roadmap. It contemplates gifts. It really is the roadmap of our conflict of interest concerns. Internally, externally, et cetera. So once we get make headway, I think, that it would be natural to have, it would be recommended that we have an AR policy, whatever that really is. \nSPEAKER_02:  identifies what those conflicts of interest are and the appearance and even if it is referencing all the other materials that are out there so that people can find them. I think that's very important and where to get guidance. It seems like it's crystal clear to me at PPC. Those types of things, they make their way to the general counsel office. But beyond that, where does an employee go to report? Because it also speaks, a lot of material speak to self-disclosure. But many most conflictive interest concerns come up not from self-disclosure. In fact, in my experience that less than 10% come up from self-disclosure, it comes up from the optics or other people raising their hand or disraising a question. So that, you know, it's all about disclosure. So I look forward to the future. \nSPEAKER_02:  presentations, but I do think we are, I was happy to hear that our ideas are welcome. And I'm first of all, and here in this area, I think it's an area that I have a strong affinity towards where we can either tie it all together or help give feedback on any new policies that come out or ARs. I'm not sure which fits. I have a second question that is unrelated, and that is... \nSPEAKER_02:  I feel a little \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't feel like I've seen some of the ARs. I understand that the intranet is very good, but is it possible that we ever could see what the employee see? That's a very important thing. It's been an important thing for me for the last year. I have a note on here that when we talk, \nSPEAKER_05:  with staff down the road about a future agenda. I appreciate that. We check to see if there's a way we can do a walk through here just so that we can kind of, or even get screen shots. But we can, we'll talk about that during one of the agenda setting meetings. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, you're talking about just so I understand are you talking about the airs in particular are you talking about the internet experience? \nSPEAKER_02:  in general for employees to see and what the look and feel is. But ultimately I do think that there's a lot of white space that isn't covered. We do a good job with the legal requirement, but not beyond that. And there's lots of great benchmarking out there that speaks to all kinds of transactions that happen internally to an organization, City, for profit, whatever. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you Madam Chair. I just have a quick question. It's probably the easiest question that you're going to get at this moment. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I probably know the answer, but I just don't want to make an assumption. What is an AR? \nSPEAKER_01:  Administrative regulation. \nSPEAKER_01:  So they are issued specifically by the City Manager and they typically do not require Council approval. We do have some ARs, the one off the top of my head is the City's social media policy, where it is adopted by the Council and it applies to everybody citywide. So in order for something to apply citywide, it has to be adopted by the Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  on. \nSPEAKER_01:  Otherwise, \nSPEAKER_01:  This is like something we've talked about a lot with this commission. So because the city of Long Beach is a charter city, the structure of the city is set up a little different, I think, where we have a couple boards like the Harbor Department and the Water Board that are \nSPEAKER_01:  They have their own discretion to make decisions and I can email you an or chart so you can see the structure of how that works, which I think is a little bit easier to digest. So where the city manager only has influence over the department under his purview. \nSPEAKER_06:  That would be great. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we can kindly request that the other departments and their boards adopt the same policies. And then as it pertains to the elected officials' answer to the people that voted them into office. So those are the people that have really authority over the elected officials. They have discretion in whether or not. \nSPEAKER_01:  as long as it's legal to adopt policies or not adopt policies. So the one that I think we just covered recently was like procurement policies. \nSPEAKER_02:  Mm-hmm. \nSPEAKER_01:  City Manager, Department, financial management comes up with the best practices and policies, and then the other elected officials and other boards and commissions, or other, those other commissions that have separate boards. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sorry. The other departments that have separate boards like harbor and water can elect to adopt the same policies or adopt \nSPEAKER_01:  their own policies, if that makes sense. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, so for example, you mentioned City Manager has a social media AR. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the social media policy was adopted by the City Council and it applies to everybody. \nSPEAKER_06:  and if there's a violation of that policy. \nSPEAKER_06:  is it um \nSPEAKER_06:  It's enforceable, correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  That's a good question. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will have to look into that. I don't know. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  in the forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  never gone to that point. \nSPEAKER_06:  and again. \nSPEAKER_01:  I actually deal with the social media issues. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we've been able to rectify most of them. \nSPEAKER_06:  And if you're going to be looking that up as a follow up, what would the \nSPEAKER_06:  What is the process of enforcing a violation? \nSPEAKER_06:  of that policy. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we could talk about that either offline. We're getting outside the scope of what was agendas here, but I can... \nSPEAKER_01:  I can email you guys the policy too so that you have it and violations are covered. I apologize for not knowing off the top of my head it never gets to that one. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's okay, thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think you actually just addressed a lot of it. It's more for when we get back together on this topic. You know, I think it would help if we really understood or could see what the requirements are, the applicability of an AR versus a code that's adopted by City Council or something else adopted by City Council. But along that line, I would also appreciate getting some guidance on what \nSPEAKER_08:  resonates most with elected and appointed and city employees in terms of what are they more likely to go to what are they more likely to kind of use as a resource or as a governing document because everything as you can tell I'm really trying to how do we still want down to make it simple and so I'd like to get a little bit of guidance from staff or from the human resources department of really kind of what type of what vehicle of those various different vehicles that we have works best and will resonate best with the individuals who have to look to them and to follow them. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  So thank you, Taylor, for putting that together. I think that seeing your presentation on the agenda was the nexus for the one written comment that we received. And I think it also, that written comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  focuses on the need for us to start looking at doing some educating of our citizenry. Because the comment talked about the ability of the former city manager to lobby immediately. But I believe city policy says that employees cannot lobby for a year after. They've left their position and you're not in agreement that that is the case. It is codified in the municipal code. And I think it's probably hard for the citizens to realize that Mr. West has been gone for what three years now? Yes. Yeah, it's been a while. And then while this conflict of interest indicates that an elected official cannot vote on an item that has, they have financial. \nSPEAKER_05:  interesting. There is nothing in state or city policy that says that the governmental jurisdiction cannot contract with a family member of that elected official. They just cannot vote on it, correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, it depends. I think we need more facts, but \nSPEAKER_01:  I think \nSPEAKER_01:  Government code 1090 would cover that contracting provision and whether or not there was a conflict and we'd run through The elements to see if they were met to make that determination Okay, which can be fair as you can see it can be fairly laborious. Yeah \nSPEAKER_05:  and it's Taylor, good point it out. \nSPEAKER_05:  This is state law. This is state law. This is it that the city is in compliance with. And so if an employee is found in violation, it's not necessarily just termination. \nSPEAKER_05:  There are three former co-workers that I worked within the county who went to jail. Oh yes, as they were prosecuted. \nSPEAKER_01:  The FVC does not take these things slightly. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_05:  It is very serious. \nSPEAKER_05:  So without, if there's no other comments, when we get down to the agenda item on workgroups, if we've got the room we'll talk about, possibly setting up a workgroup to look at this issue. So seeing no further, speakers wanting to address this, if we could have a motion in a second to receive and file. \nSPEAKER_05:  the item. \nSPEAKER_07:  Did you want to see if there's a public comment here? \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh yeah, thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Actually, there's no one in this meeting either, so we're good for right now. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're good for motion in a second. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, I have a motion in a second. Everyone vote please. \nSPEAKER_05:  and the motion passes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, Taylor. She's very sorry. Taylor is gone. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm gonna take care of you. Sorry. \nSPEAKER_05:  Taylor will show us. We skip. Why don't we give her voice a chance to rest off? \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll show you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  Emoticious. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so then we are going to go back to item three. Taylor, we decided we'd give your voice a little bit of a rest before you went into your next one. \nSPEAKER_01:  I really appreciate that, thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. So... \nSPEAKER_01:  We are covering alleged violations for the 2022 primary election, primary meaning the election that has already passed. This does not relate to anything that occurred after that election had concluded. So there were 13 allegations made during the primary election this year. \nSPEAKER_01:  Six complaints were determined either not to be violations, they were unsubstantiated, or initially referred to another agency, and we were just made aware of it. Those complaints include the use of public resources, failure to have written agreement for a loan made to a campaign, failure to report an independent expenditure for digital ads, electioneering within a hundred feet of a polling place. Three candidates allegedly made personal loans to themselves exceeding local contribution limits. \nSPEAKER_01:  the LADA declined to prosecute. All three candidates asserted it was at oversight and corrected the error. One candidate allegedly received donor contributions exceeding limits in the Long Beach Reform Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  The EDA also declined to prosecute that case. The candidate asserted it was an oversight and corrected the error. So no further action was taken because corrections were made. \nSPEAKER_01:  A complaint related to a candidate's failure to report to expenditures was reported to the FPPC as it's a violation of the California Political Reform Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  The same candidate failed to enter into a written agreement for $1,500 loan made to their campaign, which is a violation of the Long Beach Reform Act. The LADA declined to take action regarding the failure to enter a written agreement. \nSPEAKER_01:  A complaint was made against two independent expenditure committees for failing to notify an opposing candidate of an independent expenditure made on behalf of a candidate which is required locally under the Long Beach Campaign Reform Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  The committees made appropriate notice to the city clerk as required by local law. Both complaints were referred to the city prosecutor's office. At least one of the independent expenditure committees stated that it was unaware of the local requirement to notice a candidate. So the city clerk is working on a notice to all independent expenditure committees to ensure they're aware of the local noticing requirement to oppose in candidates for the upcoming general election. That concludes my presentation and I'm available for questions. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  G.T. \nSPEAKER_03:  How does the city clerk know who an independent expenditure committee is because most of them get set up kind of last minute? So how would you get that? Do you know how Monique plans to get that information out? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, I think Monique is on the line. \nSPEAKER_02:  If you're a good person, I'll show up. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, we can hear you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we know who the independent expendor committees are when they file with our office and they file their \nSPEAKER_02:  their forms with Philip McGowler. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so they're required before they can expend any money to file with you. \nSPEAKER_02:  They have a requirement. I believe they have to file within 24 hours. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, that's good to know. Thank you, Monique. \nSPEAKER_03:  Does anyone else have any questions? \nSPEAKER_00:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_00:  I didn't do the math as you were going through. Are any of these complaints still pending and not unsubstantiated? \nSPEAKER_01:  So we did have some that were unsubstantiated. \nSPEAKER_01:  which I discussed at the beginning. There was a six of total that kind of got lumped into either. We couldn't prove it. It wasn't a violation didn't get reported to us. The remainder of them. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can do the math. \nSPEAKER_01:  Action was taken and I would say that the great majority of them attempted to correct the error. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  were referred to appropriate agencies for enforcement, enforcement wasn't taken mostly because the issues have been rectified and acknowledged. There are some, a couple that are still pending. And I would like to acknowledge to that all of the candidates, as we've discussed previously, receive a handbook from the clerk's office. The clerk makes himself available. So they do receive education prior to us getting to the point of this enforcement action when violations are made. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Does anyone else have any questions or comments? \nSPEAKER_03:  JT go ahead \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  just really quickly is it possible to get a did we receive a copy of this report in writing so we can just sort of I was trying to follow along would love to read whatever you were reading from just to sort of at our digest did we receive that already? \nSPEAKER_01:  No, I can send it to my presentation to you in a memorandum, with the overview. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  You're welcome. \nSPEAKER_04:  There are still no members in the Zoom meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. Can I have a motion to receive in file, please? \nSPEAKER_03:  I have a motion by Commissioner D. Pena Dictus and seconded by Commissioner Noreve. \nSPEAKER_03:  please call the vote."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  So why don't we skip her item on the election in April? Maybe you can do the budget. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, so this is going to be a bit more brief, but I wanted to provide an update on an information in the timeline of the proposed fiscal year 2023 budget and some details on how that pertains to the Ethics Commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the topics for today are the proposed FY 23 budget timeline. \nSPEAKER_06:  our General Fund shortfall, how you can access FY23 proposed budget and ethics commission budget. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the proposed timeline looks a little bit like this. Much of it is mandated by the city charter with specific deadlines. So in July 3rd, the proposed city manager budget was delivered to the mayor. \nSPEAKER_06:  On the second of August, the mayor released the proposed CM budget along with his own recommendations to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_06:  August through September is when the budget oversight committees take place. This is a separate committee. Committees are chaired by council members. The chair of the BOC, as we call it, is Austin with members price and Uranga. We also conduct budget hearings through the month of August. That budget hearings, they cover various topics. It kicks off with the city manager's presentation of his proposed budget and then subsequent weeks cover various departments. We just had PDE fire and PREM this past week and we'll see health and public works next week. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then we have our first community, budget meeting tomorrow of three. These are being held in hybrid fashion and they are being supported by language access. So that there is interpreters available. \nSPEAKER_06:  Then September 15th is the last date for a budget adoption. September 6 is what we call the first potential budget adoption night. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then the 13th would be the last potential budget adoption night. September 15th is codified in the city charter as the official deadline. \nSPEAKER_06:  So here's what we're looking at with the General Fund for the next several years. I don't think it's a surprise or a secret that the Recovery Act has saved the city from deficit and from cuts this year. But we are looking to shortfalls in the following year. And so while FY23 is considered balanced, we are looking currently, even though we have not yet passed. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  the FY23 or not weed, the city council's not yet adopted the FY23 budget. The city staff are looking to see how we cover future shortfalls and that may in the future include cuts. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so this is how you would access the proposed budget. I just want to include for transparency that this slide was added from when you first received the presentation. I was thinking about it and I thought, well, I'm going to share all these screenshots as it pertains to the city manager's budget where the ethics information is contained. But it's probably helpful for the commissioners and the public to understand where you first access that. As a city employee, I acknowledge that I understand things can be layered. And so I know where to look, but it's not always intuitive for the general public or those who are not in this day-to-day. So you would go to longbeach.gov, you pick financial management department, and that on the left is the homepage. And in the right red box is where you find the budget information for this year. It includes everything from the community budget book to the full budget book, mayor's presentation, city manager budget presentation, and also information on the community meetings. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, ethics commission budget. \nSPEAKER_06:  The Ethics Commission budget for FY23 provides funds for Ethics Commission staff support. \nSPEAKER_06:  staff have recommended, and I'll get into the details later, that salary savings in prior one-time funds from previous and current years carry over to support the ethics education program and development. \nSPEAKER_06:  the ethics helpline or hotline, the learning management system or what we call LMS, and City staff's professional development. This is a newer program to the city, and the commission is aware that we are all learning alongside you and staff, and so we really encourage the professional development and for staff to get right into all of the organizations that will help support them. \nSPEAKER_06:  So this is a snapshot of the City Manager org chart. \nSPEAKER_06:  and how it's structured. And the City Manager's office includes administration, special advertising and \nSPEAKER_06:  promotion, sorry special advertising and promotion. And then the government community affairs and special offices. This is where ethics office is included. Alongside our office of equity, our office of action and sustainability, climate action and sustainability. And the citizen police complaint commission also known as the CPC. \nSPEAKER_06:  And at the very bottom, you'll see the executive team is led by our city manager, Tom Modica, Assistant City Manager, Linda Tatum, Deputy City Manager, Theresa Chandler, DCM Katie Numerah, Administrative Deputy City Manager myself, and Special Deputy City Manager for Recovery Marit Reynolds. \nSPEAKER_06:  The ethics commission and program highlights FY22 accomplishments in the budget book. So we get to celebrate all of the amazing things that we as a team and we as a commission have achieved in every fiscal year. So Heather and Julian take the lead on this administrative function and in future years we'll work with the chair and the vice chair on just collaborating on what we want to highlight. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the Ethics Commission in Program Support, as I previously mentioned, is listed under the government community affairs and special offices. And you'll see here under item five, support for the ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ethics Education Program, Advice Line, also Hotline and Ethics Guide, Ethics Communication Plan. This is not stagnant. We can change this from year to year. So as we grow and evolve, we can update what the key programs and services are for the ethics office. At the very bottom, you'll see that the way the budget book is built, and this is for every department, \nSPEAKER_06:  They don't do a whole line item. Um, development of every office. This book is over 300 pages. If we did that for everything, it probably be like 3000. \nSPEAKER_06:  you'll see how it has it listed as a group for the current and past two fiscal years. \nSPEAKER_06:  So again, it's listed in a financial summary form, and it's listed in revenues at the top. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then the expenditures at the bottom. \nSPEAKER_06:  City Manager's office is widely funded by the General Fund. We have the Special Avertising and Promotional Fund, which is really led by Special Event and Permit, Special Event and Filming Permits. \nSPEAKER_06:  Here's a personnel summary to highlight. You'll see that there are two areas that are called out for ethics. You have the assistant to the city manager for ethics. That is Julian's role. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then there is another one, sorry, I'm just... \nSPEAKER_06:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yep, and then you have the um \nSPEAKER_06:  See you later. \nSPEAKER_06:  I lost it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Ethics officer under Deputy City Manager, yes. And then the administrative deputy city manager is myself, but overseas or supports oversight alongside. Thrust of our awesome team here for ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  at the Ex-Office, or under-dead PC. \nSPEAKER_06:  and then... \nSPEAKER_06:  This is just a general snapshot of all of the FTEs and personnel summary for the entire City Manager office. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, future budget development. \nSPEAKER_06:  So for FY 24 and future budget years development, city staff may present requests for structural and or one time funding to support the ethics commission in programming efforts. This is something that kicks off after the holiday, sometimes right before the holidays, where we start to basically submit what we would like to propose and be considered for future fiscal years. And we classify them as both structural, which means that it is ongoing, such as an FTE position. \nSPEAKER_06:  or one time if we had a special project or we wanted to bring on a consultant to help develop something. \nSPEAKER_06:  That goes to the department heads. Our ACM is considered the City Manager Office Department Head. And so as the executive team, we more or less will pitch what we're looking to do and what we're looking to accomplish for consideration. Obviously, budget constraints are always a consideration, but that's basically just kind of giving you the, how we approach additional requests. We do require concrete backup to support requests. So for example, if we were coming and saying for the first time that we wanted to implement an LMS system or LMS, \nSPEAKER_06:  We would want to show them that we did the due diligence and looking up what that would cost and what kind of funding need that would require. We would work closely with the Chair and the Vice Chair on future budget considerations and what the commission is looking to implement as we develop our recommendations. And the commission is able to present their requests directly to the City Manager Mayor and City Council and the Budget Oversight Committee. \nSPEAKER_06:  upon approval by the full commission. So that is part of the recommendation is authorizing the Chair and Vice Chair to compose and submit. \nSPEAKER_06:  a letter to the B.O.C. \nSPEAKER_06:  Mayer and City Council and City Manager with their recommendations for FY 23 budget as are pertained to the ethics commission in programming efforts. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  And that's it. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, April. \nSPEAKER_04:  So in looking at the FY23 budget, the past chair, and I had conversations, because we only had April on board for a few months. We didn't think it was appropriate for us to yet start looking at additional staff. We really need to have a firmer grasp of how we're using our staff and show that they don't have any more capacity before we look at additional staff. But we did think it would be appropriate in the letter to ask for the ability to roll over the funds that April had indicated. The other thing that we thought it would be good to put in any letter that goes to the council, are areas in the city that we started identifying, there may be some gaps between what should be financed and what is financed. And the one area that we had identified already is the city clerk's office, because as you all remember, as we were going through the election, we learned that there is no process right now for looking at the campaign finance reports that are filed by the candidates. There just, if somebody happens to say, I see an anomaly, then it's raised. So we've had to check conversation with the city clerk about are there ways that this can be digitized and looking at different things that she might be looking for to really structurally improve and enhance the way, again, she does a great job of running the elections, but there are just things that can be added to support that. So starting to kind of raise the council's eyes to there are going to be other things as we really start delving into the work that we're doing, that we're going to raise to their attention level that we think need to be funded. \nSPEAKER_04:  So if you agree to let us, we've got kind of an initial draft that the Vice Chair and I will sign and send on. \nSPEAKER_04:  So, bye, sir. \nSPEAKER_03:  One thing on the rollover of costs from this year into funds from this year into next year, one of the tasks identified is the learning management system. The city manager in other parts of his budget identified structural funding for a learning management system. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Are we looking at \nSPEAKER_03:  multiple learning management systems or \nSPEAKER_06:  No, but we may be asked to share an proportional \nSPEAKER_06:  part of the startup costs and ongoing costs for that system. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  that will be city wide and the cost would be shared amongst multiple sources. \nSPEAKER_03: utor is. \nSPEAKER_03:  not. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  just ethics, but all of the departments which will be using it, which means every department because this will be truly citywide, not just city manager, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Also with respect to the letter, I know that last year the chair and vice chair held some meetings with City Council members. And I don't know if this recommendation is sufficient to authorize such meetings if the chair and vice chair believe those are appropriate. \nSPEAKER_00:  So it's not necessary for sending. We don't have a disclosure policy in place right now. There's nothing to prevent the chair and vice chair. Once they have the commission's blessing, and you've all voted on it. This is what you're agreeing on that you can speak to the mayor and counsel to support this position. But it is, it's not necessary, but you're more than welcome to do that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  And \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Was the letter submitted to everybody or just have it because I became those okay? \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe the letter is a part of this item. Oh, it's not just kidding. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Shaw. Well. \nSPEAKER_01:  I sure Pollock actually answered one of my more detail, my more detail question on the learning management system because I would expect that, you know, that would actually be something that also be housed and managed over the HR organization within the city. And this question's not meant to be snide. I really am just trying to understand. So we have a balanced budget for 2023, but at the same time, we're projecting deficits and shortfalls ahead in 2024. How does that happen? My understanding is we're not even in 2023 or even physical year 2023, but we're still expecting that we're going to have, we're having a balanced budget, but we're not going to meet a balanced budget. I'm just trying to understand. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I am not a budget expert by any means, but there are various factors that go into how budgets are created year to year. And as mentioned before, the Long Beach Recovery Act funding has supported a huge portion of \nSPEAKER_06:  the general fund. So under the final rule of the Long Beach Recovery Act, it was found that we could \nSPEAKER_06:  basically whatever projected revenue loss we forecasted as part of COVID-19 impacts. We could then \nSPEAKER_06:  put into general fund to support police fire and parks operations. And then move some funds around for other programming as was approved. This is all very much highlighted in publicly available memorandum through the Relonged Nutri-Covering Act program. \nSPEAKER_06:  further, there are other liabilities that vary from year to year, such as city white pensions and those types of the nature of those, insurance deductibles that are \nSPEAKER_06:  you know, that increase from year to year based on various factors. These are all projections. So it is projected that this is what our shortfall will be and they project out multiple years. So the funding that we have available now, we use for critical programming and then they work their magic to determine how they're going to work within the confines of future budget available dollars, which oftentimes comes in forms of cuts to departments where they say this is what we're projecting our shortfall is going to be. Here's what we're going to issue as budgetary cuts to departments and \nSPEAKER_06:  It depends. Like departments will. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's up to the departments to submit what they're proposing for cuts year-over-year. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't think that answers your question in its entirety because I don't have all the mechanics, but that's what I do know. \nSPEAKER_06:  and hopefully that kind of gives a little bit of insight, even if I'm not giving you the exact formula. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it does, including the fact that there's some factors like pensions and things like that that apparently are outside the budget or which I would have thought would be actually included and projected as part of the budget. So that helps for now. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  your voice. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks. I just have one area I want to look more clarity on and that's the request for the budget surplus from prior years to be carried over. And I guess one. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is that actually in the budget or how? \nSPEAKER_02:  How do we, how does the ethics commission get that? And then the other question is whether or not you mentioned for going forward, we'd have to have specific, you know, you recommend that there be, that staff would help develop, you know, specific, I suppose you'd have a list of expenses that you think you're going to have. And because I don't think that I'm not sure that we have that to support how we're going to use that budget. I have some ideas about it. So I'm just, so those are my questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, so. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  It is not built into the FY-23 budget because FY-22 is not yet closed out. So we can't say that for certain that we're going to close out the year with X-Men-A-Dollars in surplus overall within different funds. So what happens is approximately February of every year the financial management budget is going to be a huge deal. \nSPEAKER_06:  Budget team will come to the City Manager and say, we've closed out the fiscal year. Here's where we landed with surplus. \nSPEAKER_06:  Usually that's the goal. You don't want to be in deficit in a tight-limbs fund or a general fund. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we'll say, here's what the surplus is in each of these funds, these major funds. \nSPEAKER_06:  What how are we going to allocate one times? And typically, because it's surplus from one fiscal year, much to Commissioner Schottwell's question, is you don't become structural finding it becomes a one time. \nSPEAKER_06:  And so. \nSPEAKER_06:  There's always ongoing lists of what can be funded with wind times. City Council often both. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh... \nSPEAKER_06:  through official action and through request to city manager. \nSPEAKER_06:  would you know we they will cross programming or additional support for safety etc. So we have this list that we look to and that's where like that's my job then is to say \nSPEAKER_06:  to tell our city manager and assistant city manager when journal funds through plus is considered \nSPEAKER_06:  This is what we would like to have allocated to ethics. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we would show that we had salary savings for the ethics officer position. We had one time savings that Becky had previously advocated for, I think, in the amount of $35,000. Here's what we use. Here's what we didn't use. We would like to keep this to continue ongoing programmatic efforts. That it's a little easier to not have the concrete data. I think we can come up with reasonable estimates on what our portion of the LMS is, what the hotline may cost, what professional development costs may be. \nSPEAKER_06:  to sell our ask on roll over funds. It's really when we get into creating the new budgets and including this in the budget, whether one time or structural, that we really wanna have that more concrete data to show that now that we've onboard LMS, we know that our portion is X-Men of dollars annually. Or now that we've brought on the help line, we know that this is how much it's gonna cost year over year with a projected CPI increase. That's kind of data that we then need to show them. When we go to future fiscal year budget, compared to when they do surplus allocations. \nSPEAKER_02:  So if I understand you right then, by February, the amount of the surplus have been determined and also will be in a position to identify what the amount of the surplus is attributable to the ethics commission savings. And then at that point, it seems to me like we'll also be in a better position or in a pretty good position to say, for example, like with the education program, let's say that Heather recommends that certain modules be purchased or software or something like that to plug in or use in that. That would be a one, maybe it's a subscription, I don't know what it's going to be, but that would be an identifiable expense that we would use it for or the purchase of the LMS itself or, is that, if I got that right? \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, so... \nSPEAKER_06:  There are two options. One is one that we as a team were planning on regardless was saying. \nSPEAKER_06:  Here's what our savings were for FY22. And this is what we'd like to roll over to FY23. Beyond that, it is very possible that we can say, in addition, we'd also like X amount of money for A, B, or C. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that the option one is like 99% certain and then option two is just depends on what other needs there are maybe we request $20,000 and they say we can give you 12. So we see what happens with the competing interests beyond what option one would entail and \nSPEAKER_06:  So the books close usually mid month following the previous month, we would probably be able to calculate with our financial services officer how much money we landed in surplus for our program in November and then we'll have that data ready to go late February early March is actually when those surplus recommendations go to the city council. So this practice of saying okay yes this is funded yes this is funded yes this is funded usually it takes place December January so Fortunately I'm in all those meetings so I can I keep track on the progress of where we are at any given time so I can make sure that we're including the interests and the needs of the commission or we're recommending \nSPEAKER_04:  for this year. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  the Council authorized us. \nSPEAKER_04:  in the initial vote in September to carry over any funds that we did not spend. So you're saying we don't need to work on that with them this year? \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll do it. \nSPEAKER_04:  like you said Becky had an idea. \nSPEAKER_05:  that it was going to be about $35,000. And she had that included in the actual budget. Yes. As predicted. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't, yes, she had that included in the budget as projected needs. So what we are going to do is we're going to, you know, we've already worked on the expectation that we're going to just add that in FY22 surplus happening in Q2. \nSPEAKER_05:  of the calendar year 2023. So we don't need to talk to the council about \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that it's a good idea for you to reiterate the request to roll over any surplus funds from FY22 into FY23 for the ethics program and commission purpose. \nSPEAKER_04:  We can put in our letter but we don't have to physically meet with them. Maybe we do it when we start physically meeting with the new council because it's not going to be this current city council that's going to vote on surplus. It's going to be the newly seated council in May or in December. Correct. Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  QUAL you place layer. \nSPEAKER_06:  they take \nSPEAKER_06:  office today. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Just, just to... \nSPEAKER_02:  Finish up if I can't mean from what you're predicting. \nSPEAKER_02:  the next years are going to be more and more difficult to the extent that we can, I'm going to say, take advantage of this surplus now, especially to do like what I'm going to call probably one-time expenditures that we need to get the educational program going. I'd like to see us figure out how to do that and having this come up periodically to get reports about it to make sure we don't miss any timing on that could be critical to that because it looks like it's going to keep getting harder as given the fiscal picture. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Welcome. \nSPEAKER_02:  Anyone else have any questions? \nSPEAKER_03:  There are no members of the public in the Zoom. \nSPEAKER_03:  and chair your mic is off. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a motion, a mover, there we go. So moved by Commissioner White, seconded by Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_04:  can we go? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you."

But there were \nSPEAKER_00:  They did cover a lot of issues and there were some really great takeaways that Julie and I both got that we've outlined On the report some of those key ones are you know repairing broken trust building internal capacity \nSPEAKER_00:  creating touch points a lot of um \nSPEAKER_00:  just really good reminders and thoughtful. \nSPEAKER_00:  suggestions if you will and you know how to just build a strong ethics program was what I was taking away from it. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then also one of the sessions focused on stronger whistleblower protections or outlying discriminatory algorithms. So it was good. It was a good way to spend the day. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, \nSPEAKER_00:  I told him that it was a little too long. They could have done without some of the one hour breaks. But... \nSPEAKER_00:  Other than that, it was a good day spent doing good things. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. Anyone have any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, still nobody in the... \nSPEAKER_02:  Actually we have someone join at this time if you'd like to speak on this item Please use the raise hand feature or hit star nine on your phone \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing none, that concludes public comment. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can I have a motion to receive and file the report? \nSPEAKER_01:  I have a motion by Commissioner Debian Adictus and a second by Commissioner Feedler. Seeing no other comments, can we call the vote please? \nSPEAKER_02:  Come here, Chef Eater. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  Take a look at it. troops softly're headed to get their hands on their face. It's like the bottom off interesting gets in their hands. Particularly with yes teachers you see an I've been \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  You have your monthly update. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Chair. So, several updates for you this month. First and foremost, we did have our third meet and confer with IAM that went \nSPEAKER_03:  rather well based on, we're not there yet, but we've gotten a lot closer. So I did supply them with a pretty thorough outline of the 30-minute launch. \nSPEAKER_03:  that they could look at before the meeting and so we took that time during our meeting to go over that have them ask questions. They're, they're seem very supportive. They did have a few requests that we asked them to do a formal information request on just to memorialize what they're asking for so we can continue moving forward. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, and they did provide me the different terms that they'd like a little, or they've suggested a little bit more explanation being included in that training, which I agree with. During that meeting, as I mentioned, \nSPEAKER_03:  Last month, we were building a survey to send out citywide to start getting input. \nSPEAKER_03:  on the model for the program but more just starting to engage staff early. HR recommended that I hold off on that survey until I am was comfortable with that. And they are. They just sent me their approval on that today. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, I'll start building \nSPEAKER_03:  I've started building a presentation. We're going to do what I'm calling a soft launch. And taking, we're going to present the survey and just kind of a high level overview of the ethics program to directors, city management, and our administrative officers. And then send that survey out, citywide. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then once we, I figure I'll let it go about two weeks. And then we're hoping to get, as we've talked about before, you know, a solid list of maybe five mottos and catch phrases that the ethics team \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll bring them to you to maybe decide on two or three and then we'll send it back out to the city for a final vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  I feel like we've made a couple good steps forward since we last met. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then Sydney, our M.A.C. helped finalize that survey. So she was very helpful in that. So thank you, Sydney. \nSPEAKER_03:  help line update. We did have our meeting with NavX and the City Auditor's Office. I think we all agreed that we'd like to do one help line that kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know if Bifurcates the right word where, you know, the fraud, the auditor kind of manages their lane and ethics manages our lane. So we got the cost, the pricing summary for that, which we've shared with the auditor's office. High level auditor staff seems to be supportive. There were a few concerns that I think we've addressed with NavX. So based on the pricing summary that we received, it's now \nSPEAKER_03:  Bing. \nSPEAKER_03:  digested in the auditor's office. So we'll need to kind of have another conversation with the auditor to see how she feels about moving forward in partnership with the help line. So feeling hopeful on that. But more. \nSPEAKER_03:  more to come on that where we've proposed to share costs 50-50. So that's really the decision that we're waiting on. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know exactly what they spend a month, but we've... \nSPEAKER_03:  based on \nSPEAKER_03:  the elements of the different ethics point. \nSPEAKER_03:  help lines we're going I think the auditor was using the basic model we've opted to go one up just for the different reporting techniques that it allows for us to do etc. So it does increase the cost. So I imagine the auditor may be a little concerned about cost increase on on her part. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  figure all of that out. So that should once the auditor \nSPEAKER_03:  Hopefully decided the way we want her to decide that should move pretty quickly. So we're hoping for a September, if not earlier, launch of the helpline. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then the education program, so the NeoGov, the LMS contract is in place. We are actually in the first week. \nSPEAKER_03:  of what is projected to be a 16 week process of \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, getting the system in place and then getting all of the administrators, myself being one of those administrators trained on this LMS. \nSPEAKER_03:  HR coincidentally is meeting with the NEO. \nSPEAKER_03:  the assigned implementation manager that Neo go of assigned to the city that meeting is tomorrow. So we'll have a better idea of what those next 16 weeks look like, but high level it's a lot of training for staff on the system. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So 16 weeks that puts us, I project probably December January launch, like a full citywide launch of the program. \nSPEAKER_03:  December could be kind of a weird month only because people are checked out. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  in December so we may opt to go with January. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  So just wanted to... \nSPEAKER_03:  Let you guys know that the timeline has definitely changed, but that \nSPEAKER_03:  I actually welcome that change. I think it helps develop really a more... \nSPEAKER_03:  holistic program instead of doing it in pieces. So looking forward to that. And then why we're waiting for that, you know, those trainings and stuff to take place. I breached out to the \nSPEAKER_03:  the citywide public information team. \nSPEAKER_03:  You know, there's member, there's \nSPEAKER_03:  PIOs from each department that meet monthly at the end of the month. So I've asked to start being included in those meetings so we can start strategizing what our communications plan is going to look like. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then this week I am \nSPEAKER_03:  in the middle of SCCE's, four day compliance and ethics essential workshop. So that's just wanted to lift up that that's 28 hours and 13 sessions. \nSPEAKER_03:  of schoolwork this week. But it's been really awesome to start putting the pieces together. So I'll share more about that with you next month. And then I wanted to give Sydney just a minute to address the commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, commission. Currently I'm working on drafting an outline for the supplier code of conduct, which involves researching other city supplier codes of conduct and how they fold into their procurement practices and policies, as well as liability with their city attorney offices. So working on drafting a list of questions to collaborate with the city attorney and financial management office to make sure everything is in alignment. Currently we're targeting and presenting this to the ethics commission in our October meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thanks Sidney and with that I'll turn it back over to you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Does anyone have any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_04:  Mishna'de ge\u00e7ir Titan. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks. Great to hear from you Heather. Kind of curious about the help line and the lanes that you referred to. I think it's early days and I know you're working that and it's great to have a good partner with the auditor's office. I think it's really important going forward, work towards that, the give and take and the sharing. Because really, it's really those two lines. I don't know how vibrant they'll be in the early days but that's where you're going to find all the root cause, the hot spots and where you need to go for training. You know, it really will help you and hopefully there's going to be a lot of sharing back and forth. Because I think you're going to be an important ally and vice versa. \nSPEAKER_03:  I agree, yeah, I think there will be a lot of sharing. I know that there is some concern about keeping the... \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of the autonomy of the fraud hotline complaints. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I think there's definitely room for partnership too. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, and both sides need to respect the need to know. But at the end of the day, there needs to be really sharing. If you're really to learn and to understand, let's see. I think I had another one here. \nSPEAKER_00:  no better idea than to do recommitment in the beginning of the year that generally works. It does get lost at the end of the year. And then looking forward to Sydney's supplier code of conduct. Thanks. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, thank you Heather. A couple clarifying questions for the help line, the NavX help line. So the city auditor already had NavX on contract, okay. And are you also looking at how to use the help line not just to track or take in allegations of misconduct but you're also using it for advice. Are you contemplating using it for advice? \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. The NeoGov system for LMS that you're putting in. Well, that is contemplated by the city and your other departments within the City of Management Office that that would be kind of the tracking tool for all learning management throughout the entire city for employees. \nSPEAKER_03:  I believe that is the goal, yes. \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know that every department will use it initially. I don't know what levels of training go on in different departments. But I know the mandatory city-wide trainings that all of us have to take. That will live there. HR, all of the city-wide HR trainings. But yeah, that is the assumption is that, \nSPEAKER_03:  All of us will use this platform. \nSPEAKER_05:  is that to the extent you do that, it just makes it easier for employees to kind of understand or to go to see what training they have to complete. And I look for a lot of things where we can kind of make it more intuitive and that they know this is where they have to go as opposed to having to hunt and pack. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, I agree. \nSPEAKER_05:  The supplier code of conduct, I'm sure you're contemplating this, but in terms of what you would just mention and when you do bring that forward Also efforts that or the plan that can be put in place with the city attorney's office to incorporate that into To specifically incorporate it at least into future terms and conditions of our contracts and Thank you for taking the SCCE course and I believe you have do you have a requirement of working in a ethics related rule for six months or a year before you can take the Certification or housing can you take the certification? \nSPEAKER_03:  It just recommends that you know enough basic information before you take it. We're all actually registered. Once you start, you have 90 days. So I don't know that any of us have hit the start button yet. Just because that clock starts ticking once, once you do. But when I signed us all up, they did not. \nSPEAKER_03:  Specify any requirements. \nSPEAKER_05:  for the certification itself. \nSPEAKER_03:  certification and we're doing that through ECI. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh, that's through ECI, then SCCE also has a certification that's offered, but I think you're the only one taking the SCCE course, correct? \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm doing the essentials workshop, so it's not. It's not. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's not for certification, it's just for knowledge. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Check. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks. Just two things. One, I just want to congratulate you. This was a wonderful report, and it's so nice to hear all these things getting accomplished. So anyway, congratulations to you and everybody that's working with you, because it's really really wonderful. And along those lines, when you talked about it, you're going to be talking about communications. I'm not sure exactly who you're talking about communicating with, but I hope that when this is rolled out in January or whatever, that there's a presentation of the City Council, just letting them know publicly. And then I hope we can get the public affairs for the city to also put the dues a splash about this to the public, because I think that's, you're talking about restoring trust, and I think that's one of the big goals of the commissional role is to restore public trust in what we do, and rolling out these things is going to be a huge step in that. So this is really, really great progress. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Anyone else have any comments or questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_04:  JT, is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_02:  There's no members in the Zoom. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. May I have a motion to receive and file the report of the ethics officer? \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a motion by Commissioner Schottwell and a second by Vice Chair Pollock. Please call the vote."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_00:  So the last item on our agenda are to receive and refile reports from our ad hoc committees for Commissioner Anuray's benefit. We, from time to time, set up ad hoc work groups that have a very specific time-limited focus on actions that they're going to work on. And it's no more than three members of the commission ever. So right now we have two work groups because that's really all we can ever have at any given time without tapping into other issues that come up. So we have the two reports. I'm going to speak on behalf of the lobbying work group and we did not meet this last month because of our travel concerns. We were all out of town at least one week of the month. So we will be meeting this Friday and hopefully we can get that together. Heather. Let me make sure that Commissioner Anuray has the report that we sent out earlier to everyone or did we send it to everyone yet? I don't think we have. No. So we did have one group meeting where we all looked over issues of lobbying and we'll be coming up with a report of some recommendations and we'll get that to you. Then the other work group that we have right now is the work group on my mind is blanking disclosure. Disclosures. Thank you. And is Commissioner Shotwell or Commissioner Feedler going to report on that? \nSPEAKER_00:  Flipcoin. \nSPEAKER_01:  I can briefly update, I think this ad hoc committee with staff met a few times over the last month. We finalized what we are comfortable calling a working draft of the disclosure policy that was ready for submission to the whole commission. I believe that was circulated to you last week, last week. We did that with the kind of goal in mind for everyone to sort of read it and digest it at their own schedule in anticipation of that being discussed in more detail at the September meeting. So we are very excited to have a more prolonged discussion with everyone about that. And I guess formally based on this agenda item, I think unless Commissioner Shotwell has anything else to add, I think that in light of that upcoming discussion, I think we want to just sort of propose. I would like to prolong this ad hoc committee's formation to accommodate any feedback we receive at the next meeting and to make appropriate adjustments. So I think not looking to dissolve the committee at this point. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so both of the work groups are going to continue into our September meeting. And I know we had talked earlier about possibly setting up a work group on conflict of interest, but let's hold that over until September and see if one or both of these work groups are dissolved at that point in time, if that's agreeable to everyone. And by then we will also have had the presentation on nepotism and maybe that can all be folded into one work group. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you for your attention chocolate. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's a clarifying question. So we said we could only have two, I'm not advocating any change to our plans, but we can only have two work groups that are ad hoc committees. But if we have two members on each, could we not have three? \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, we could do a third, however, that would leave Commissioner Anne Norvey and Commissioner Dave Anadictus is the only people that are available to serve on a work group on conflict of interest. And I think there might be other commissioners that are serving on one of the two work groups that would want to be part of that process. So I would recommend that we wait and do that in September. \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree with that. I just wanted to make sure I understood that we didn't have any restriction from having three because we have had that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Nu kan vi ha f\u00e4lt. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. We could do three, but... \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so is there any public comment on this? Does anyone have anything to add? \nSPEAKER_00:  JT, is there anyone in the room? \nSPEAKER_01:  Nope, we don't have anyone still. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so can I get a motion to receive and file the reports? \nSPEAKER_00:  I have a motion by Commissioner Dvenidictus and a second by Commissioner Weiss. Please call the vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I did say at the beginning of the meeting that I let Commissioner and over."
