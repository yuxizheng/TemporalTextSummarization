        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So the second item is \nSPEAKER_07:  to receive and file a report on the current powers and duties of the ethics commission and then have discussion. \nSPEAKER_07:  about the priorities and work plan for this commission going forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  And let me just say at the outset, we did receive some public comment on this on this item. \nSPEAKER_07:  Has there been anything else that's come in JT since you sent us the comments? \nSPEAKER_07:  that had been received as of about 30 minutes ago. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, we didn't receive any other. \nSPEAKER_01:  comments from the public. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. And will those comments do they just get attached to the minutes or what happens with them? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, they'll be attached at the end in minutes as a item four as they have been for all the other minutes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, all right. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, then someone from staff going to give us the overview to sort of kick us off on this this item. \nSPEAKER_07: \u05e2 \nSPEAKER_10:  starts to go forward. Are you ready? Yep. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  from the city attorney's office. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  and good afternoon chair and commissioners. \nSPEAKER_10:  a while back. \nSPEAKER_10:  It seems like a long time ago now, but when we first start this process. \nSPEAKER_10:  We reviewed the commission's powers at State and State Charter Section 2402. \nSPEAKER_10:  Now that we've heard from the other and from some members of the public too. \nSPEAKER_10:  about actions that are of ethical concern. \nSPEAKER_10:  It seemed like it was a good idea to re-review those duties and powers so that because they have actually some context for us now. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  So to recap the powers that are listed in section 24-04-02. \nSPEAKER_10:  The ethics commission is responsible. \nSPEAKER_10:  for providing support agencies and public officials. \nSPEAKER_10:  in administering the provisions of the charter and other laws related to campaign finance. \nSPEAKER_10:  conflict to the interest and government ethic. \nSPEAKER_10:  You're responsible for making recommendations to the mayor and city council concerning campaign finance reform. \nSPEAKER_10:  lobbying, governmental ethics and conflicts of interest and to report to the council concerning the effectiveness of these laws. \nSPEAKER_10:  to assist departments in developing conflict and interest codes as required by state law. \nSPEAKER_10:  to advocate understanding of the city charter, city ordinances, the rules of elected and other public officials, city institutions, and the city electoral process. \nSPEAKER_10:  and to develop an educational program to familiarize newly elected and appointed officers and employees candidates for elective office and their campaign treasurers. \nSPEAKER_10:  and lobbyists with city, state, and federal ethics laws and the importance of ethics to the public's confidence in municipal government. \nSPEAKER_10:  The final catch-all is such other duties as may be established by this charter on the municipal post. \nSPEAKER_10:  So in looking back at some of the items that were discussed in the city auditors report, one example that you could see is that \nSPEAKER_10:  there were \nSPEAKER_10:  several agencies. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um. \nSPEAKER_10:  There was a discussion of the Form 700 that's required by the Fair Political Practices Commission. \nSPEAKER_10:  So for example, \nSPEAKER_10:  there that is required to be filed by all city officials elected officials and most city employees. \nSPEAKER_10:  But in terms and it's filed with the City Clerk's office, questions can be sent either to the FPPC or to the City Attorney's Office. \nSPEAKER_10:  But it doesn't really seem to have a home. It doesn't really seem to have a group. \nSPEAKER_10:  that educate \nSPEAKER_10:  you know, educate city employees and officials about the importance of it. \nSPEAKER_10:  other than \nSPEAKER_10:  you know, basically announcing the deadline and saying you need to do this. \nSPEAKER_10:  So. \nSPEAKER_10:  That's kind of an example of how one of the current duties that you \nSPEAKER_10:  you have that would be useful in the audit setting, for example. \nSPEAKER_10:  would be to develop some kind of policy. \nSPEAKER_10:  regarding \nSPEAKER_10:  and the education of why this is an important measure, not just because there are penalties associated with noncompliance. \nSPEAKER_10:  but because, you know, that... \nSPEAKER_10:  It has been devised as a way of \nSPEAKER_10:  revealing to the public. \nSPEAKER_10:  what potential conflicts of interest might be. \nSPEAKER_10:  in business and other kinds of interests that fit the employees and elected officials have. \nSPEAKER_10:  So. \nSPEAKER_10:  And that was just kind of to kick off where... \nSPEAKER_10:  where we currently stand. \nSPEAKER_10:  And I think that we also have had discussions and I think the city auditor also had discussions. \nSPEAKER_10:  about the importance of enforcement. \nSPEAKER_10:  Enforcement is currently taken into account by other agencies. It's not something that this body currently has. \nSPEAKER_10:  And I think that to some extent, \nSPEAKER_10:  it. \nSPEAKER_10:  You know, that that's a little bit of a misconception that public may have at the moment is that the \nSPEAKER_10:  that this group is able to immediately start enforcement actions. \nSPEAKER_10:  there would have to be some additional steps taken in order for that to happen, such as an amendment to the municipal code or even to the charter. \nSPEAKER_10:  in certain cases. \nSPEAKER_10:  So. \nSPEAKER_10:  That kind of... \nSPEAKER_10:  the update of where we are right now. You have very broad policy making and educational. \nSPEAKER_10:  kinds of powers and duties. \nSPEAKER_10:  You have the ability to request the port from council and to report to council where you see deficiencies. \nSPEAKER_10:  and you have the ability to request. \nSPEAKER_10:  kind of. \nSPEAKER_10:  additional powers. \nSPEAKER_10:  if you believe that they're necessary. \nSPEAKER_10:  So with that, if there are any additional questions, and if I don't know the answers, I may have to try to find out and report back to you, but \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm happy to assist with anything along those lines. \nSPEAKER_08:  I have a question. \nSPEAKER_08:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  The current process, thank you for the explanation that it's very helpful. When there is a disclosure made, who currently vets the disclosure and makes a determination whether or not a conflict of interest exists with respect to the current code. \nSPEAKER_10:  So. \nSPEAKER_10:  the municipal code. \nSPEAKER_10:  has a very broad prohibition against conflicts of interest and avoiding even the appearance of conflicts of interest. \nSPEAKER_10:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_10:  but state law actually covers \nSPEAKER_10:  in two different places, conflict of interest. One is in the Political Reform Act, which is in the government code. \nSPEAKER_10:  And that's the one that requires the filing of Form 700. \nSPEAKER_10:  Form 700 are filed with the City Clerk's office, and for elected officials, they are sent to the FPPC. The FPPC has the ability to review them and take enforcement action on them. \nSPEAKER_10:  whenever they receive a complaint generally. They are not a proactive agency. They... \nSPEAKER_10:  govern the entire state of California and all of the elected officials in it and most of the appointed officials and city employees. So they obviously have a very full plate. \nSPEAKER_10:  but they... \nSPEAKER_10:  So on a complaint basis, they are the ones who would. \nSPEAKER_10:  review information in a form 700 and take some kind of enforcement action. And they do that. \nSPEAKER_10:  They take action for failure to file and for \nSPEAKER_10:  actions that are, you know, that are in conflictive interest. \nSPEAKER_10:  The other kind of conflict of interest that you can have, which is different. And this is the kind of \nSPEAKER_10:  I think this is something that may actually be covered a little bit in our discussion in the next action item item three. \nSPEAKER_10:  But \nSPEAKER_10:  Government Code Section 1090. \nSPEAKER_10:  is sort of, um, \nSPEAKER_10:  the codified version of what most people think of the conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's where someone who has \nSPEAKER_10:  someone who is a decision maker, such as a city council person, makes a contract which benefits them personally. \nSPEAKER_10:  And those are very serious and those have both criminal and civil penalties. \nSPEAKER_10:  Those are sometimes enforced by the district attorney's office and sometimes by the city prosecutors, sometimes by the attorney general's office, depending on the level of the \nSPEAKER_10:  of the conflict. \nSPEAKER_08:  and going back to it. \nSPEAKER_10:  going back. \nSPEAKER_10:  from the back. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I guess so. So who makes that referral when another one is either alleged, reported or disclosed formally? \nSPEAKER_10:  So when something is alleged. \nSPEAKER_10:  And frequently it will be made directly to those agencies. Sometimes people will go directly to the District Attorney's Office or they'll go directly to the \nSPEAKER_10:  to the FPPC. \nSPEAKER_10:  Sometimes those complaints will come to my office to the City Attorney's Office. \nSPEAKER_10:  and depending on what kind of a complaint they are, they will get referred to one of the other agencies for enforcement. \nSPEAKER_10:  I was going to say separately from that, and this is something that the city auditor covered in. \nSPEAKER_10:  in a little bit of not too much detail in the audit. \nSPEAKER_10:  There are also conflicts of interest that are sometimes alleged to occur in the contracting process. \nSPEAKER_10:  Those are different from the Form 700 ones and the, you know, the kind of common law conflicts of interest. \nSPEAKER_10:  Those also are usually reviewed by my office before any contract is entered into by the city. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I have a question for you. \nSPEAKER_07:  for Commissioner DiBena Dent. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is that the question? \nSPEAKER_07:  was that the answer to the \nSPEAKER_07:  question that you are asking. \nSPEAKER_07:  because I guess I'm thinking about it in terms of. \nSPEAKER_07:  If you are an employee of the city or you're working with the city and something and you think that somebody has a conflict of interest. \nSPEAKER_07:  What? \nSPEAKER_07:  what happens and where do you go? \nSPEAKER_08:  You're correct. There's a gap there between what is internally reported and what are the current processes that say as an employee goes to human resources versus what is, I'll say more procedural or the institutional type of stuff that gets reported through a, you know, an affirmative disclosure or through, you know, collecting the information. I'm not really hearing how we deal internally when things, you know, when there's a speak up culture. How, who handles those? How do they get referred and who centralize? Is there a clearinghouse if it's the city attorney's office, human resources to kind of vet to make a determination whether or not it should be investigated or vetted. \nSPEAKER_08:  different than the city attorney's vetting process when a contract is put before her. \nSPEAKER_10:  different than it. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think this is something that is staff may want to weigh in on too, but \nSPEAKER_10:  I don't think there is a central process for it. I think that \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  I mean, I think there is a completely different process. It's the staff, it's a city employee. \nSPEAKER_10:  believes there's a conflict of interest or some kind of irregularity and some city contracting process. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think that is a different group that determines what happens next. \nSPEAKER_10:  then if it's a member of the public alleging that there's some kind of campaign finance issue or conflict, conflict is interest. \nSPEAKER_10:  in a person. \nSPEAKER_10:  you know, finances that would prohibit them from acting on a map. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, it's a very big question and I didn't mean to whaylay everybody, but I, I, um, thinking about the \nSPEAKER_08:  survey feedback and the information that we received there was a disconnect between \nSPEAKER_08:  what employees perceived should be happening, corrective action, whether it be. \nSPEAKER_08:  you know, from more of a \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  It will almost employment or personnel standards, standards of conduct versus the types of things that you just described. And that's the gap I was trying to identify. \nSPEAKER_10:  Right, I think that I think the key thing there is that there isn't really a central place to make it complete. There is there are many different places. You can go to the city attorney's office. You can go to the city auditor hotline and leave an anonymous complaint. \nSPEAKER_10:  You can go to human resources, you can go to the city manager's office. \nSPEAKER_10:  You can go to your own supervisor if you feel like it's a contractor as opposed to an employee that is doing something, you know, I'm toward. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Right. \nSPEAKER_10:  So there are a lot of different pieces to it, but there isn't really a central focal point. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think got it. Correct. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. And now we can add ourselves to the list. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Ashley. Thank you, Leonard, that one, that lottery. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  I have a couple questions. Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  So, Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  when you \nSPEAKER_04:  Talk about enforcement. \nSPEAKER_04:  on \nSPEAKER_04:  Is it the investigation process? \nSPEAKER_04:  and enforcement. \nSPEAKER_04:  Is it just the investigation process that you're really kind of considering enforcement or is it actual? \nSPEAKER_04:  the enforcement process. Don't let me. \nSPEAKER_04:  explain. \nSPEAKER_04:  A lot of times you can have a group that's responsible for providing the investing, doing the conducting and investigation. \nSPEAKER_04:  making a recommendation. \nSPEAKER_04:  but then it may be management, maybe city officials, it could be city attorneys office that then would do the actual enforcement, make the decision of what they're gonna do with that. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  in that regard I like to, you're using the term enforcement. \nSPEAKER_04:  which we don't, as an ethics commission currently, have that level of authority. \nSPEAKER_04:  Does that preclude us as a commission from having? \nSPEAKER_04:  or \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  getting involved in a investigation process. \nSPEAKER_04:  or overseeing investigation processes a better way of putting it. \nSPEAKER_10:  So the answer to that question is complicated by the fact that there are certain charter requirements. \nSPEAKER_10:  that relate to \nSPEAKER_10:  different departments, for example, the Civil Service Department. \nSPEAKER_10:  has its own rules on how investigations are conducted and on the discipline that's imposed. \nSPEAKER_10:  I believe the same is true for the police department. \nSPEAKER_10:  So there are, I guess what I'm saying is it depends on what kind of conflict \nSPEAKER_10:  and who. \nSPEAKER_10:  against whom the allegation is made. \nSPEAKER_10:  So if we're talking about miscontext by the employee, \nSPEAKER_10:  The city rules and the city charter and in the municipal code currently apply and both \nSPEAKER_10:  Especially the meat guru. \nSPEAKER_10:  are in the charter, it would require a charter change. \nSPEAKER_10:  That would be sort of a more complicated thing to get to. \nSPEAKER_10:  But for example, \nSPEAKER_10:  usually if there's a \nSPEAKER_10:  in this conduct alleged by against the city employee that will go through the human resources department. \nSPEAKER_10:  They would conduct the investigation sometimes internally and sometimes they refer it out to \nSPEAKER_10:  another to an outside investigation. \nSPEAKER_10:  Volume \nSPEAKER_10:  And it's the appointing authority, whoever the, whether it's \nSPEAKER_10:  you know, one of the legislative departments likes that. \nSPEAKER_10:  To be continued.... \nSPEAKER_10:  like an elected official. \nSPEAKER_10:  or if it's a city department. \nSPEAKER_10:  They're the ones that are responsible for determining the discipline, usually according to negotiated either according to civil service rules or according to negotiated labor unions. \nSPEAKER_10:  So that one's kind of complicated on that one, on that issue. \nSPEAKER_10:  they're arguing. \nSPEAKER_05:  That will be enough from bardzo Fran\u00e7ais sir you \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm sorry, I thought you were finished. We'll go ahead and then I'll ask my question. \nSPEAKER_10:  Oh, I was just going to say that. \nSPEAKER_10:  that is contracted with \nSPEAKER_10:  allegations of this conduct against, for example, an elected official. \nSPEAKER_10:  a lot of the time those would be investigated by the police department. \nSPEAKER_10:  currently or by an outside investigation firm hired by the city's depending. \nSPEAKER_04:  more by the fpc fpc itself i think in some cases they've been there \nSPEAKER_10:  for anybody. \nSPEAKER_10:  or the district attorney office? The district attorney office, that's right. We have many possibilities here. \nSPEAKER_04:  the district attorney's office. \nSPEAKER_10:  and they will sometimes \nSPEAKER_10:  especially if it's something where a police report has been made, they will take that report and do their investigation from there. \nSPEAKER_05:  One concern that I had from the audit, and I'm sure that \nSPEAKER_05:  that uh \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it applies to this conversation as well as that there's also no feedback loop. \nSPEAKER_05:  for the right people to know if a complaint has been made through one of those channels. So people could get a complaint if somebody named an administrative officer. \nSPEAKER_05:  or to HR and it wasn't clear to me that if HR... \nSPEAKER_05:  didn't, you know, failed to investigate because they didn't think it was worthy of investigation or whatever decision they made. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's no... \nSPEAKER_05:  oversight of that determination unless somebody takes that same complaint. \nSPEAKER_05:  to another party and says, well, I raised it with the HR and they didn't do any. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is that accurate? \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm pleased you're held up with how that I guess if it were an employee \nSPEAKER_10:  and the employee is... \nSPEAKER_10:  alleged you have committed some of this conduct, it would ordinarily be the supervisor that would. \nSPEAKER_10:  report it, you know, request an investigation and \nSPEAKER_10:  would take some kind of action. And so that, that \nSPEAKER_10:  The supervisor would be aware. \nSPEAKER_10:  of the action that would take it. \nSPEAKER_10:  So if you're talking about like a whistleblower maybe. \nSPEAKER_10:  was that? Yeah, I'm talking about it. I think it's very spectacular and it's what I'm saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm talking about it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I mentioned employee goes to the supervisor and says, you know, \nSPEAKER_05:  Joe Smith is sitting next to me. He just awarded a contract to his wife's firm. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well. \nSPEAKER_05:  Joe Smith, the supervisor really likes Joe Smith, Joe Smith's a favorite employee. The contract is a... \nSPEAKER_05:  is to affirm that the supervisor is aware of and says \nSPEAKER_05:  No harm, no foul. \nSPEAKER_05:  and fails to investigate fails to put together a report fails to determine if it's a violation of city code. \nSPEAKER_05:  in that scenario. \nSPEAKER_04:  and that's an area where it's fun. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And I'm going to get it. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  I think they're going to take an even greater risk. I think there are probably workplace privacy laws that prohibit some of that. I mean, I think within the context. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  of city employment, there are many different roles that are going to impact that. \nSPEAKER_10:  that are different than rules that have to do, for example, with whistleblower making a complaint to the city of New York. \nSPEAKER_06:  be a good business guy. \nSPEAKER_06:  So if I could jump in and also to clarify for Bobby, the employees don't award contracts in government agencies. \nSPEAKER_06:  the employees make recommendations to the decision makers who in this case will be the city council. \nSPEAKER_06:  So it, it has to go through a hole, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is based on my experience with the county. \nSPEAKER_06:  It was always very clear in our contracts that the employees were not awarding. \nSPEAKER_06:  that even if we had recommended a contractor to the Board of Supervisors, \nSPEAKER_06:  They did not have a contract until the board acted upon it and the board could totally overturn. \nSPEAKER_06:  our recommendation. Is that the same in the City Council? \nSPEAKER_06:  That's correct. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  It's okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  So, and I think the, we'll go ahead. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  No, I was, I was gonna go back and kiss, kiss. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm getting a little confused here based on my experience with the county. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I hear what you're saying, Council, is that things could go various different places. \nSPEAKER_06:  but based on my experience in the county. \nSPEAKER_06:  It was very clear who you reported what to. \nSPEAKER_06:  if it involved fraud, which fraud would involve something meaning a misappropriation of funds. \nSPEAKER_06:  inappropriate use of funds or inappropriate award of contract. \nSPEAKER_06:  anything that had to do with a fiscal area. \nSPEAKER_06:  Those were reported to our auditor controllers fraud hotline. \nSPEAKER_06:  They would then make the decision whether it rose to the level where they would do the investigation or they would refer it back to an investigative unit in in the department to review. \nSPEAKER_06:  if it comes to. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, harassment in the workplace sexual harassment. Then that went to another area. And I think that's where you're talking about HR. H does HR in the city really only address. \nSPEAKER_06:  kind of those pervasive issues that apply to one of the protected areas of race, gender, age. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think A-Star has a very broad authority to deal with. Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  You good? You're good. Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  I've been pulling discipline, yes. But is it more behavior that impacts other people that they investigate as opposed to something that's really fraudulent? \nSPEAKER_10:  I think something that if they were fraud alleged that would probably go through our financial management department and it would likely go directly to the police department. \nSPEAKER_06:  and it's \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. We're in Bethany Gaysian. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  come back because we're taller than the county we can. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  because it's important. \nSPEAKER_05:  Right. \nSPEAKER_10:  deal with more of it directly. Okay. Similar structure. \nSPEAKER_05:  Taking my example and moving it away from contracting though, let's say an employee went and said, hey, Joe Smith is not working. \nSPEAKER_05:  A full eight hours. \nSPEAKER_05:  He's clocking in and then going out to a three hour lunch and I bring that to my supervisor and again the supervisor believes that Joe Smith is getting a lot of work done and doesn't care and doesn't investigate. \nSPEAKER_05:  It just seems to me there's a lot of... \nSPEAKER_05:  open space where ethical violations are not captured because there are so many different places where you can raise issues. \nSPEAKER_05:  And they don't all come together. I personally think they should come together at the ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  that there should be some oversight of the receipt of complaints of whatever nature. \nSPEAKER_05:  But I don't, I mean, obviously, I don't know that we have the authority to do that right now. I don't know that there's a desire on the part of the rest of the commissioners. \nSPEAKER_05:  but I did something. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we ought to talk about, but I guess that's moving more to what we saw in the audit. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would say that I will hardly agree with Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_04:  know i think that you know these things can be raised in a variety of forms but they all need to be centralized in terms of \nSPEAKER_04:  how they're tracked number one number two i believe that there needs to be a centralized uh... place where somebody can go confident to confidentially raise anything \nSPEAKER_04:  they want to raise. And in our context, I think that also needs to be. \nSPEAKER_04:  not just employees, but any contractor with the city and then any citizen. \nSPEAKER_04:  of the city should be able to raise a concern. \nSPEAKER_04:  but I'm really concerned that the supervisor would be investigating anything along that line. I really think, or I'm also concerned that the \nSPEAKER_04:  employee, we're going to need to raise an issue with the supervisor. Those really need to be handled by an independent organization. I agree that maybe an expansion of our \nSPEAKER_04:  charter so we may not be able to go there. Yeah, but there are I think there are a lot of things that we can do. But one of the things also that was in the \nSPEAKER_04:  audit or in the culture survey, I forget which one, but it was the, you know, this constant and I think this is pretty common in industry, in companies around the country and also in city government, this \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, complaints being raised and no one knowing what's been done about that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I do respect \nSPEAKER_04:  the privacy rights. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I've dealt with a lot of situations where \nSPEAKER_04:  Council. \nSPEAKER_04:  have been very concerned risk of worse. \nSPEAKER_04:  and have previously prevailed and kind of \nSPEAKER_04:  of not publicizing these types of events. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're starting in terms of my day job. We're really starting to lean to where we are going to. \nSPEAKER_04:  That film ... \nSPEAKER_04:  that we will let individual work groups know and to the extent of the level of the individual. \nSPEAKER_04:  larger groups, including potentially the entire company. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the presumption is we're going to publicize these events and the reasons why people are leaving. \nSPEAKER_04:  as opposed to not. There has to be a very sound reason for not. \nSPEAKER_04:  and it can't just be in what we're avoiding is just at concern about litigation is not a sound basis for not publicizing. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, I concur with all the above. I think that when I'm hearing from everybody, we want some procedural justice. We need some transparency. We need some central point. We do not want to get bogged down in minutia and let people do their jobs. But I do think oversight is critical. And we have to rely. \nSPEAKER_08:  on audit doing their auditing, uh, city attorney, we have to have these partnerships so that we can get things, you know, the information flowing where needed and \nSPEAKER_08:  get the word out because the survey results were a disappointment. And it could be as simple as procedural justice, you know, people knowing what the heck happened. \nSPEAKER_08:  you know, when I made a complaint, nobody ever got back to me or just as we've talked about when people raised things to what extent do we? \nSPEAKER_08:  Do we want and will? Clothes loops. I like what Bobby said about clothing the loop. \nSPEAKER_07:  How do we... \nSPEAKER_07:  accomplish that. I mean, I'm looking, I was looking at the survey this afternoon and \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, one of the problems we're having when we talk about this, I think, is that there's so many different types of what I want to call them. \nSPEAKER_07:  Miss Kanda. \nSPEAKER_07:  To me, it seems like the contracting thing is, and I guess I just naturally want to put things into sort of \nSPEAKER_07:  categories. So we have what I'm going to call the \nSPEAKER_07:  you know. \nSPEAKER_07:  the contracting stuff, then we have. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, abusive of resources maybe, which is \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, actually could be pillow-ferring things or could be not. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  using \nSPEAKER_07:  and that using time, and we have the \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  the regulatory. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, regulatory, but also we have the, what I'm going to call the interpersonal. \nSPEAKER_07:  interpersonal stuff in terms of how people are treated or \nSPEAKER_07:  or \nSPEAKER_06:  I mean, \nSPEAKER_06:  and we have the electeds. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the employees because I think the elected get handed differently than the employees. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, and I think that it goes back to that clearinghouse that that common ground and having a trusted employee who can vet and receive or if you go even third party, there's all kinds of options that you can do. I've always found in my experience that \nSPEAKER_06:  I like it. \nSPEAKER_08:  start small with the code of conduct, basic civility, you'd be surprised what comes up. It's pretty simple then, which, where you go, if it's regulatory belongs to the attorney or et cetera, et cetera, but we don't understand all that, and we need to have faith in what is going on, and that getting responsive and thorough review, and vetting some independence. I can do that for us and let people do what they can do. Organization is making mistakes, but I think that we need to start building. What does, there are probably a lot of great things that we do well. I'm not sure yet. We have to figure that out. \nSPEAKER_04:  I mean, I agree. \nSPEAKER_04:  I agree I think there needs to t 8 \nSPEAKER_04:  We need to get to a point. We may not be able to do it under the current. \nSPEAKER_04:  where our current authority is to where they centralize clearinghouse for how these uh... for \nSPEAKER_04:  kind of bringing them in and then signing them out and then when they are assigned out uh... they have to be it we need to have insure that there are consistent \nSPEAKER_04:  processes being followed for how things are investigated. If they're not going to be investigated by one group, so that each area \nSPEAKER_04:  is investigating them the same way and where there are deviations, there is a reason for that deviation. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, and commissioner wise, I think a good place to start in the categorization. \nSPEAKER_05:  Each year the city auditor issues a \nSPEAKER_05:  report of all of the allegations received and matters investigated. And they categorized them. I'm not totally wed to their categories. \nSPEAKER_05:  but it's a good place to start and \nSPEAKER_05:  As I understand, in their spreadsheet at the end of 2019, they showed that some were reported elsewhere for investigation. I was not within the... \nSPEAKER_05:  within the city auditors purview and that is generally the personnel issues, the sexual harassment, discrimination. So we have sort of a template where you can start and say, well these are some categories and then also see some of the categories that got reported out. I imagine if we look at multiple years we'll have a pretty good list of \nSPEAKER_05:  types of matters. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we can start with and then look at \nSPEAKER_05:  aside from from the city auditor who \nSPEAKER_05:  has the authority to investigate these who have the authority to do enforcement. \nSPEAKER_05:  to Commissioner Shotwell's point that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Some of them are investigated by one authority, but that authority doesn't have enforcement. \nSPEAKER_05:  oversight. So at least it's a starting point. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Do we want to? \nSPEAKER_06:  Do we want to start with where people report or do we want to start with what the existing policies are? \nSPEAKER_06:  because you think you kind of put the cart before the horse. If you set up your procedures for reporting without making sure that the policies that are in place are one comprehensive and two, the employees know what they are. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Because if we set up a report in my opinion, if we set up a reporting process, \nSPEAKER_06:  before we make sure that the policies are in place and everyone knows where they are, where they can access them. \nSPEAKER_06:  then the employees are going to view this as punitive and penalizing. \nSPEAKER_05:  and uh \nSPEAKER_05:  Looking back at the audit report, one of the main recommendations was to have a single comprehensive document that that incorporates all of the ethics rules and I believe that \nSPEAKER_05:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_05:  preparing that document is within our listing authority. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I think that I'm putting together that document. \nSPEAKER_05:  We will then identify. \nSPEAKER_05:  As part of that, who are the investigative authorities? Who are the enforcement authorities? Is it somewhere? And where are the... \nSPEAKER_05:  Gags. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I believe within our authority we can make recommendations on how to fill in the gaps. I would love to go. \nSPEAKER_05:  to that document. \nSPEAKER_05:  tomorrow. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we just got started on this. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm going to die. Divide it up for you. It's a burden. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we just got started on the investigation side, but I absolutely agree. We need to clear up. \nSPEAKER_10:  Absolutely agree. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  what the policies are and not only what they are. \nSPEAKER_04:  kind of pulling them together and then the centralized place where somebody can find them. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  and that is clearly within our existing jurisdiction. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  zobaczy a \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Even the code of conduct I thought could use some tightening. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  In that case everybody, thank you. And to all of that, this Hold\u5f71\u7247 is today's short story from Sam Joseph's \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f. You ask me to wrap this series up on a\u5411 from an Atelier Foundation as your title for a letter to An suspects surrounding Fox one. Obviously you are probably not fitting with the principle. T \nSPEAKER_08:  Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  And maybe because I mean part of this discussion is supposed to be \nSPEAKER_06:  identifying where we're going to go kind of setting a roadmap. \nSPEAKER_06:  And maybe we kind of \nSPEAKER_06:  Do two work groups, one that focuses on policies, one that focuses on the reporting lines. \nSPEAKER_06:  I was thinking along the same line. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think that the foundation for all of that, though, has to be \nSPEAKER_07:  What? \nSPEAKER_07:  what some of the problems are. So the types of misconduct that are identified in the auditor's report, the types of misconduct that \nSPEAKER_07:  have been identified in the survey that was \nSPEAKER_07:  taken because I think that will be \nSPEAKER_06:  Are you talking about the policy discussion or the word is a reporting go discussion? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Because I think about both, because depending on what the problem is. \nSPEAKER_07:  that \nSPEAKER_07:  good to see you. \nSPEAKER_07:  which helps show where there are gaps in the... \nSPEAKER_07:  policies and it could also show \nSPEAKER_07:  you what type of investigation you might have to do depending on what the \nSPEAKER_07:  what the problem is. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, I agree chair wise. I agree chair wise. I think as Bobby said, you take a look at the last two years. What are you hearing about? What are you not hearing about? And I think we all know those from small to large as the attorney has pointed out, those that which are workplace, those are much more, you know, the fiscal, the procurement issues, and then going into. \nSPEAKER_07:  I agree. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  the bigger fraud waste and abuse issues. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I think there's lots of lobbying. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think there's lots of lobbying. \nSPEAKER_07:  One thing that's mentioned in the... \nSPEAKER_07:  in our charge and certainly is we've heard a little bit about it in some of the public comments is election stuff. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's another whole topic that... \nSPEAKER_07:  that isn't encountered. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, isn't mentioned in those things, you just... \nSPEAKER_07:  You just said. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  And that actually might be a third working group. \nSPEAKER_07:  anyway \nSPEAKER_04:  that we might need. \nSPEAKER_04:  because I like the idea of I was thinking we would as \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Morales said we need. \nSPEAKER_04:  break up into working groups to tackle these. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'd also say that even though our existing charter does not, we do not have a role in saying investigations, I think that we have a very rolling partner. \nSPEAKER_04:  in the city attorney, I'm in the city auditor. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh... and conducted and kind of partnering with us and working with us very closely \nSPEAKER_04:  even to the extent that she might even expand what her role is within her existing authority. \nSPEAKER_08:  And we have to be mindful of even the auditor has conflicts of interest doing their job versus investigating. There is an importance for independence there. But I think all this is mappable. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  We'll let's talk for a minute about. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm gonna. \nSPEAKER_07:  Maybe. \nSPEAKER_07:  as we may have to start, is there any problem with us? \nSPEAKER_07:  We also have item number three. \nSPEAKER_07:  Coming up. \nSPEAKER_07:  which is where we can ask, you know, what the idea is we ask staff for certain kinds of reports. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  but in life. \nSPEAKER_07:  in connection with this. \nSPEAKER_07:  discussion. \nSPEAKER_07:  It seems to me that one of the things we all want to be sure we look at are \nSPEAKER_07:  the auditors. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thanks for watching, if you liked this channel please don't forget to subscribe, put a like and \nSPEAKER_07:  piloter's recent reports. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  And at least I'm interested in comparing that with \nSPEAKER_07:  more specifically with what the survey. \nSPEAKER_07:  with the survey. \nSPEAKER_07:  Survey. \nSPEAKER_06:  found. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  And is there a way we can get more drill down on what is in that report? I mean, \nSPEAKER_06:  I appreciate \nSPEAKER_06:  the need for maintaining some privacy. \nSPEAKER_06:  But it doesn't even tell us which departments are having issues. \nSPEAKER_06:  because it really doesn't even delve into where what departments are. \nSPEAKER_06:  They had it. \nSPEAKER_06:  requests coming out of them for investigation. \nSPEAKER_04:  I had the very same concern and because there could be some department that needs to be an immediate intervention. \nSPEAKER_04:  given the \nSPEAKER_04:  what may be going on in that particular department. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we're not asking for any names, any information on the employees, just the departments. \nSPEAKER_04:  I will say along that line that having worked with ECI for a number of years, they do have and do provide the data down to a working group level. \nSPEAKER_04:  believes a down-to-a-group that is at least, if I remember correctly. \nSPEAKER_04:  can people or more. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, I thought, although it's different, but even the survey responses on faith and management to do the right thing. If reported, will they get back to me and do the right thing, take action? Even the pulse on. \nSPEAKER_08:  knowing about the code of conduct or taking the training. I thought that was interesting. \nSPEAKER_08:  Some organizations are very high. \nSPEAKER_08:  and a lot of them work. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Just. \nSPEAKER_08:  very, very low. You know, you'd be lucky if you had over 20% to me. Those are all telling. \nSPEAKER_08:  all very telling. \nSPEAKER_08:  with how they feel about management or getting involved. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  There are also several departments where the response rate was so low. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  And I don't know what to read in. I don't know what to read into that because they don't have. \nSPEAKER_07:  that they don't have time for it, that they don't care about it, that they weren't encouraged to take it. I don't know how to... \nSPEAKER_07:  How do I... \nSPEAKER_07:  to read that at all, but there were \nSPEAKER_07:  quite a few departments that have less than 25%. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, responding. So. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'd be very interested in what human resources has to say. \nSPEAKER_08:  They may have their own perspective about that too. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_08:  either a willing partner on willing and depending on what we're working on, but that's a critical partnership for us too. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would agree and I was curious about the amount of \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh \nSPEAKER_04:  How much the survey was publicized and how it was a voluntary survey? \nSPEAKER_04:  but how encouraged people were to take it, you know, and what that level of encouragement. So I saw the city auditor had 100%. \nSPEAKER_04:  on \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_04:  sure that you know there is probably a little extra push just because she's \nSPEAKER_04:  given the nature of her organization, because even all of them being very attuned to these types of issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's still hard to get to 100%. \nSPEAKER_04:  And there's going to be in some cases it's just survey fatigue. People are just overloaded and it's hard to get to. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just gonna... \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  even the 70s or 80s without a tremendous amount of pushing. \nSPEAKER_06:  And did they have the concurrence of the unions that it was something that the unions were encouraging the employees participate in also. \nSPEAKER_06:  because if you don't have the union supporting the \nSPEAKER_06:  the participation, it's going to be lower. \nSPEAKER_04:  You're right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  Be. \nSPEAKER_07:  I want to bring up one other thing that has been \nSPEAKER_07:  This has been in my mind. \nSPEAKER_07:  which is this is overall. \nSPEAKER_07:  idea of creating a culture of ethics. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  one of the things that \nSPEAKER_07:  concerns me is that \nSPEAKER_07:  that this commission has \nSPEAKER_07:  I shouldn't say concerned, but... \nSPEAKER_07:  We're really... \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, under the radar. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  and it seems to me. \nSPEAKER_07:  There was talk about being an annual report. \nSPEAKER_07:  about ethics in the city every year because that would elevate. \nSPEAKER_00:  and be your beauty. \nSPEAKER_07:  V \nSPEAKER_07:  subject of ethics. \nSPEAKER_07:  in the city. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think. \nSPEAKER_07:  So one question I have is \nSPEAKER_07:  Should we try to do? \nSPEAKER_07:  an annual report. \nSPEAKER_07:  for ourselves. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  2020. \nSPEAKER_07:  even though we know what we've done. \nSPEAKER_07:  and hopefully by the time. \nSPEAKER_07:  We finished the year. \nSPEAKER_07:  we'll have a \nSPEAKER_07:  and we have another \nSPEAKER_07:  Meeting or two. \nSPEAKER_07:  We will. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, we will have a chart of work. \nSPEAKER_07:  laid out for ourselves. \nSPEAKER_07:  But I wondered if that might be a way to start to bring some attention to the topic of ethics in the city. \nSPEAKER_07:  Maybe that's \nSPEAKER_07:  Maybe that's premature. \nSPEAKER_07:  because we know that mostly what we have to say is that we picked our members. There was COVID. \nSPEAKER_07:  We picked the redistricted commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  And now here it is the middle of November. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  the point is we're \nSPEAKER_07:  We're underway. \nSPEAKER_07:  Or should we just \nSPEAKER_07:  Should we just put that, you know, put that, put that off? \nSPEAKER_07:  And I'm thinking about whether we should do this in terms of \nSPEAKER_07:  beginning to establish a \nSPEAKER_07:  a \nSPEAKER_07:  a culture of ethics in the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  Who would submit the report to or how would we publicize it? \nSPEAKER_05:  What are our options there? \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Well, one thing is to take most advisory commissions to submit annual reports to the city council. \nSPEAKER_05:  to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's no. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  And then I guess there's press coverage of the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it would get out public. \nSPEAKER_05:  they either would \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know. It seems to me an annual of course probably a good idea this year, as you say, we can at least identify a couple things. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  if we put together a document. \nSPEAKER_05:  Dad. \nSPEAKER_05:  \uc544... \nSPEAKER_05:  you know. \nSPEAKER_05:  is a conglomeration of all of the ethics rules and where they are, and you know, a relatively concise but comprehensive document, that's not going to happen in 2020. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  But when we have that, we would want to do a pretty big \nSPEAKER_02:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  can't pain around communicating that. \nSPEAKER_05:  So it seems that \nSPEAKER_05:  wouldformation. \nSPEAKER_05:  create an opportunity for us to really make an impact. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think it would be a good idea to have as a base at annual report this year. And then, you know, obviously we'll have more to say in an annual report next year, but next year. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll have interim \nSPEAKER_05:  things that will be \nSPEAKER_05:  publicized somewhat broadly like to all of the employees and then putting it on our website and \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  other and then obviously we'll have to have discussions with the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  over some of the recommendations because I think that once we sit down and try to do the comprehensive document we are. \nSPEAKER_05:  Talk about authorities. \nSPEAKER_05:  whether it's authority or the authority of the city auditor. \nSPEAKER_05:  or some other organization, I think there's going to have to be some new authorities. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  But I do believe we can use the annual report to this year because it wanted to educate them what we have done. Because I think a lot of people may be a forgot what some whatever responsibilities were within the redistricting commission. So they're like, you've got an ethics commission that's been around for a year and a half and nothing happened with regard to ethics. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  on \nSPEAKER_04:  but uh... \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Pollock's point, I think, just setting out even if the end of report laid out our roadmap. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that way we're bringing the city council and the mayor and even \nSPEAKER_04:  even to the certain extent, even communicating to city employees or to the city kind of what we're doing. That brings everybody along on the journey with us. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh... and so we're not hitting them \nSPEAKER_04:  cold when we have this big, huge campaign with, say, a new code of conduct with associated policies. And we say, and now, annually, you're going to certify to each of these policies. You're going to do an annual certification, things like that. I don't know. That way, we're bringing them along on the journey. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right. \nSPEAKER_07:  next. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do. \nSPEAKER_07:  This may be a minor point, but \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  I do think there are some things from that. \nSPEAKER_07:  on it too, then our \nSPEAKER_07:  but what I'm gonna call low hanging fruit. \nSPEAKER_07:  So things like nobody collects the results and does anything with the results of whether or not all the 700 forms have been collected or not. \nSPEAKER_07:  Now that wouldn't be very hard to do. I don't know. I mean, it would it is a hard thing to do because it's hard to get everybody to do it. But but saying, okay, an April first because they're all due on March 15th. I think is the date anyway. An April first. \nSPEAKER_07:  This list is going to be publicized or posted or something like that. Maybe that would, you know, serve as an encouragement. So I'm just saying there are a few things. \nSPEAKER_07:  we can. \nSPEAKER_07:  we could. \nSPEAKER_07:  We could do probably. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  or suggest be done. \nSPEAKER_07:  to \nSPEAKER_07:  to bring \nSPEAKER_07:  to start to elevate the awareness. \nSPEAKER_07:  of ethics in the \nSPEAKER_07:  in the city while we're trying to figure out. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know more of what I'm going to say profound, profound things to be done. \nSPEAKER_07:  and maybe some of those things are things we could. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  We could talk about. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Now at the next. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know. \nSPEAKER_07:  and adapt them or \nSPEAKER_07:  Think about them a little bit and talk about them at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Do you? \nSPEAKER_07:  In terms of moving us forward, do you think that it's premature? \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  to \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  break into \nSPEAKER_07:  subcommittees at least for purposes of the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  in order that we could. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, talking smaller groups and in more depth. \nSPEAKER_07:  about \nSPEAKER_07:  some of these \nSPEAKER_07:  some of these topics. \nSPEAKER_07:  It seems \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't think I'm pretty sure at all. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I would really like to have that do that at the end by the end of this meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I'm. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I'm looking at my notes. Tell me if I've got this right. We have. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have this idea of \nSPEAKER_07:  identifying the types of complaints and conduct that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  We. \nSPEAKER_07:  need to be. \nSPEAKER_07:  figuring out a way to address. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have the issue of \nSPEAKER_07:  week. \nSPEAKER_07:  sort of the identification of the problems. \nSPEAKER_07:  And we have the issue of policies and \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_07:  codes of conduct. \nSPEAKER_07:  And we have the issue of \nSPEAKER_07:  of \nSPEAKER_07:  of reporting processes and investigation. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have this. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know. \nSPEAKER_07:  idea that we've been \nSPEAKER_07:  We \nSPEAKER_07:  be able to put \nSPEAKER_07:  all of what there is into one document. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, how many subcommittees? \nSPEAKER_07:  how many small groups do we want to have? Can we? \nSPEAKER_07:  Can we get it down to? \nSPEAKER_07:  Can we do it in terms of three? What's the best way to organize this? That's what I like to hear people talk about. \nSPEAKER_07:  And Commissioner Speedler and Manicke, I haven't heard you speak. So. \nSPEAKER_07:  Don't be shy. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm on the road, I'm sorry. But um. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye, sel.. \nSPEAKER_09:  in general I \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm in agreement. I think if we do. \nSPEAKER_09:  The idea of subcommittees is great. I feel like there's some additional work as a group to just put forth some values and agreement. \nSPEAKER_09:  around how we're moving forward so that also can be communicated in our annual report. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think it's important for folks to understand what value is worth entering. \nSPEAKER_09:  as a commission and then also. \nSPEAKER_09:  you know, in terms of the process, like how, like our commitment to communicating. \nSPEAKER_09:  you know, the frequency of communication to the public or to council be \nSPEAKER_09:  the spirit of transparency that we're hoping to operate with. So. \nSPEAKER_09:  took me as a great and then also I hope that we can still do a little bit more foundational work. \nSPEAKER_09:  as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Chair White. \nSPEAKER_04:  i mean i like what you'd listed \nSPEAKER_04:  My sense is if we broke into three. \nSPEAKER_04:  And there may be a third that was mentioned, I think, by Commissioner Morales, or vice-chair Morales, that we might want to consider a bit. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh \nSPEAKER_04:  one, I think we could kind of collapse. \nSPEAKER_04:  the identifying what needs to be addressed. \nSPEAKER_04:  along in terms of like where \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, what type of policies are not clear for the city? There was some of that in the audit report. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh... i think we could collect collapse that with \nSPEAKER_04:  the work on the code policies and \nSPEAKER_04:  any engagement or training that needs to be done so that could be one bucket all together. \nSPEAKER_04:  Second bucket might be then reporting, the reporting process, the help line process. \nSPEAKER_04:  also knowing a hotline process. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then coupled with the investigation, even though that's not our authority, but it could be some recommendations for the city auditor. And then eventually recommendations that I've \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'd like to see in a few years. \nSPEAKER_04:  where our responsibilities are, those responsibilities of this commissioner are enhanced so that we actually do have housed all those. \nSPEAKER_04:  investigations in an ethics department within the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  That would be a second bucket and then a third bucket. \nSPEAKER_04:  could be dealing with the elected. \nSPEAKER_04:  and also the lobbying rules because that's a major aspect of the charter and called out in our responsibilities. I think we need to focus a lot on what's happening within the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  but I think there's an expectation that we're also looking. \nSPEAKER_04:  on the outside especially. \nSPEAKER_04:  with some of the public comments we get. So I think we could have a whole third bucket dealing with the elected and the lobbying roles. \nSPEAKER_04:  And those would be the three committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  Topical minute. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I heard you say. \nSPEAKER_07:  The \nSPEAKER_07:  what I'm going to call the areas of misconduct policies and code of conduct as \nSPEAKER_07:  and education as one. \nSPEAKER_07:  another one being more than what I'm going to call the process parts of it. \nSPEAKER_00:  now. \nSPEAKER_07:  the reporting and investigation. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then the third being \nSPEAKER_07:  I guess issues unique to electives. \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean besides Labby and the other one would be \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  I suppose it would be. \nSPEAKER_07:  campaign issues, election issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  The only thing I would add to that, and I wonder if it fits into any of those three or as a separate category, is audit and oversight. \nSPEAKER_05:  And maybe that's something we just deal with later. Once you have your processes in place, everybody knows what the rules are. \nSPEAKER_05:  And training is kind of part of autumn and oversight. So you've got the rules. You know what the enforcement mechanism is. Then how do you verify? \nSPEAKER_05:  a the AS... \nSPEAKER_05:  \ubd10! \nSPEAKER_05:  policies are taking hold. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that they're being enforced equitably. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that there's an appropriate oversight. \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know. I didn't remind that's a separate group, but it kind of goes with training, but \nSPEAKER_05:  It may be premature to be looking at oversight of a process that is ill-defined. \nSPEAKER_08:  I agree with you, Bobby. I think... \nSPEAKER_08:  It's kind of at the end of the story, because there and is where it'll be codified. You know, what is it that we will be doing from these three subgroups? I think we'll identify. \nSPEAKER_00:  what is \nSPEAKER_08:  our roles a little bit in these areas and then there's kind of the fourth action and that is putting it into print and putting it making it a living document acceptable. \nSPEAKER_05:  and then see what. \nSPEAKER_08:  and see what happens. \nSPEAKER_05:  and their measuring the culture of compliance. \nSPEAKER_05:  at a point in time and then measuring it again in a year or whatever time period appears to be appropriate. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think we have the first measure just within the \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, the I report. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  which is a big topic. \nSPEAKER_07:  But it's really important. I like Commissioner Manike's reference to values. \nSPEAKER_07:  and just \nSPEAKER_07:  sort of setting down and in a way I think that's that's that is what's in the \nSPEAKER_07:  in the code of conduct, but \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  and there may be \nSPEAKER_07:  maybe even. \nSPEAKER_07:  maybe much, much bigger than that. So \nSPEAKER_04:  I like the Commissioner Dave Benedict. This is, you know, \nSPEAKER_04:  statement about you know. \nSPEAKER_04:  Current code. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think there's a lot of opportunity there and it's buried in ordinate. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think we have the opportunity to expand it. It can't be. \nSPEAKER_04:  too long so that no one reads it, but it has to be somewhat concise. \nSPEAKER_04:  but the Commissioner Maniki's point, I think it really is. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yo. \nSPEAKER_04:  The values can be, should be broadcast everywhere and a lot. \nSPEAKER_04:  signs and things like that and we need to come up with and I think we can work with the city to come up with a set of values. I think there may be other organizations with the city that will also. \nSPEAKER_04:  HR and then others within the city will have a lot of input on what they think the values should be owned. And it may not even be the ethics \nSPEAKER_04:  Department or Commissioned. \nSPEAKER_04:  authority to own the values and maybe somebody else. \nSPEAKER_04:  but i think that they can be a bad rock within \nSPEAKER_04:  a new code of conduct. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feeder, I see you unneeded yourself. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  here. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just had one very quick question. I concur with everything that's been discussed. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think it all sounds good. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  just your \nSPEAKER_03:  because Mr. Mannick he brought up the idea of value. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think this is a relatively... \nSPEAKER_03:  simple question that perhaps council can address. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I know that we will probably discuss this at length in our working groups and as a whole by \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  You know. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's right. \nSPEAKER_03:  To the extent that I hear a call for. \nSPEAKER_03:  increased transparency and that being one of the values that the Commission can \nSPEAKER_03:  In there. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  I also am hearing in the discussion of \nSPEAKER_03:  investigation and oversight and being a recording clearinghouse. \nSPEAKER_03:  on behalf of the various department within the city and for citizens. \nSPEAKER_03:  value that \nSPEAKER_03:  theme to be \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  implied in that duty is one of absolute confidentiality where both citizens of just regular citizens and employees can feel like \nSPEAKER_03:  they can come to us. \nSPEAKER_03:  and it can be and some that can be investigated. \nSPEAKER_03:  Obviously. \nSPEAKER_03:  very confidentially. \nSPEAKER_03:  and you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  before anything would be disclosed like a finding as a commissioner shot will. \nSPEAKER_03:  suggested with his day job, you know, publishing. \nSPEAKER_03:  findings of an investigation or closing the loop, I think someone mentioned. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, \nSPEAKER_03:  How would we do that? \nSPEAKER_03:  given our current structure where everything is a public meeting under the brown ad. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, you know, I don't know if that's a simple thing we can just amend in the charter, but \nSPEAKER_03:  I don't know how I'm just curious how we could \nSPEAKER_03:  eventually down the road have some sort of investigated or oversight authority and still \nSPEAKER_03:  Do those duties. \nSPEAKER_03:  in a manner that doesn't disclose that Joe Smith is being investigated before any. \nSPEAKER_03:  findings are made. So that was just a thought I had. \nSPEAKER_03:  Again, I'm sure that's a relatively simple fix. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  but you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  I- \nSPEAKER_03:  I did note that there's some sort of contrast to the extent that might be a strong word. \nSPEAKER_03:  where on the one hand our commission is \nSPEAKER_03:  going to advance the culture of ethics and in so doing. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  try to increase \nSPEAKER_03:  transparency. \nSPEAKER_03:  of investigations and annual reports and things like that and also at the same time. \nSPEAKER_03:  be a source of confidential and investigated. \nSPEAKER_03:  over site. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm wondering if the city attorney might speak to that. \nSPEAKER_07:  up Shiv Brown. \nSPEAKER_10:  That's sure what the question was because it was kind of long. \nSPEAKER_10:  But I would say that first of all, they're absolutely... \nSPEAKER_10:  that there are that's a very theoretical question because I think until you get to the place where you've defined what it is that you're going to be doing. \nSPEAKER_10:  and for which department. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's hard to say, and I know that other ethics commissions that do annual reports do things like aggregate the data. \nSPEAKER_10:  and report findings without mentioning names. They describe conduct or they describe situations but they don't include. \nSPEAKER_10:  details that would allow identification of individual. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. Is it possible? \nSPEAKER_03:  Is it possible that we can, uh, or give me for background noise, um, that our, our commission can conduct an investigation of some, uh, form down the line and, and, um, still comply with our Brown Act requirement? I guess that was the, \nSPEAKER_03:  my question in a nutshell. \nSPEAKER_10:  If that I think the moment the answer is you cannot. You don't have investigatory authority at the moment. So that kind of is, he's my bad and proud. Don't ask this. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, no, I'm aware that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, no, I'm aware that I guess just, you know, I know that it's theoretical in the sense that we don't know quite yet. How or what we would be investigating, but to the extent it is a question that can just be generally addressed and that I don't know. I'm just curious. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are we able to create any? \nSPEAKER_10:  Are we able to create any? \nSPEAKER_10:  There are other bodies in the city that conduct confidential investigation such as the citizens complaints, police complaint commission and the civil service commission. \nSPEAKER_10:  Those are both charter commissions and it might require charter amendments for you to be able to do that. \nSPEAKER_10:  But generally speaking, you've identified a good issue. You are a public body and most things that happen have to happen in public sessions. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I feel. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. I mean, I guess that is fine. \nSPEAKER_10:  I mean, I guess that's fine to find a way around it. And it might not be a simple way to fix it, but there probably is a way to fix it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, no, I'm sure there is it was just something again that. \nSPEAKER_03:  came to mind if I was hearing everyone else discuss the very issues that were. \nSPEAKER_03:  trying to, of course, for our permission. \nSPEAKER_07:  I guess if we... \nSPEAKER_07:  If we end up \nSPEAKER_07:  designing some sort of investigative role for. \nSPEAKER_07:  this \nSPEAKER_07:  Commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  and that was going to be adopted that whole discussion about. \nSPEAKER_07:  how it would be done and how open it would be or had to be or \nSPEAKER_07:  how how quote confidentially could be would be something that would have to be. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, looked at it really carefully. \nSPEAKER_07:  person that you know we don't \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, if we were investigating personnel, I maybe then there's some personnel exception that it would fall under. \nSPEAKER_07:  I don't know. \nSPEAKER_07:  with that view. \nSPEAKER_07:  But I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_07:  week trying some. \nSPEAKER_07:  authorities and some experts to help us. You're that out. \nSPEAKER_07:  But that's attention. I do. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  One other thing I wanted to bring up that um \nSPEAKER_07:  came up in her. \nSPEAKER_07:  in a preliminary. \nSPEAKER_07:  discussion that \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm Marallise and I had with the city clerk. \nSPEAKER_07:  and staff when we were getting ready for this meeting was the issue of \nSPEAKER_07:  a code of conduct for. \nSPEAKER_07:  for the members of this commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  and that would have to do with \nSPEAKER_07:  whether we are going to. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have rules. \nSPEAKER_07:  apply to ourselves. \nSPEAKER_07:  about involvement in, for example, \nSPEAKER_07:  local political. \nSPEAKER_07:  local political. \nSPEAKER_07:  issues. \nSPEAKER_07:  or campaigns. \nSPEAKER_07:  Sal. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's another, maybe that falls under the \nSPEAKER_07:  there um \nSPEAKER_07:  under values. \nSPEAKER_07:  but that's something to keep in mind as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  I do think that. \nSPEAKER_07:  to the extent that one of the \nSPEAKER_07:  The things suggested by the report is that we need to. \nSPEAKER_07:  be open and transparent. I think that's it. \nSPEAKER_07:  So that's generally an important. \nSPEAKER_07:  Ah! \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  quality for us or value for us to have as we as we go about our work. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. Sure. Why? On that Commissioner Morales's point, I think it's an excellent idea. \nSPEAKER_04:  and it turns to trying to keep the workload balanced of those three different working groups. \nSPEAKER_04:  My sense is that might fall nicely in that third one, which is dealing with elected and lobbying. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  The other thing I'm just going to say is that, you know, we can. \nSPEAKER_07:  We can see. \nSPEAKER_07:  divide this work up a certain way today. \nSPEAKER_07:  and divide into groups to work on it. And if we decide it doesn't work very well, there's nothing to stop us from. \nSPEAKER_07:  re-organizing ourselves and the work in another way or breaking it down in a... \nSPEAKER_07:  in another way. So I don't think we're \nSPEAKER_07:  We're not wedded to this for. \nSPEAKER_07:  for any period of time, the end. \nSPEAKER_07:  now in our next meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  in the \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  from my perspective. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  out. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I will be right back. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would agree. I just had another spot to Commissioner Pollock's point. \nSPEAKER_04:  about that oversight and auditing. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, that also might be one, you know, we could put it off. \nSPEAKER_04:  or it could just be something that poor and ordinary ideas could be handled by that second working group dealing with bruh. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh, help line reporting, the investigation process, and then \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  auditing and \nSPEAKER_04:  and oversight. \nSPEAKER_04:  which potentially even could get into the... \nSPEAKER_04:  potential. \nSPEAKER_04:  oversight that we might have of the city auditor's process to the extent that the city auditor has a \nSPEAKER_04:  takes on more or \nSPEAKER_04:  that it centralizes the investigations in her group. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think that makes sense for now. And then if it makes sense to... \nSPEAKER_05:  break it off later. We could. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do you think we're ready to have the to have a subcommittee on elected? \nSPEAKER_07:  and those. \nSPEAKER_07:  and those. \nSPEAKER_07:  those issues. I know that it's something was very specifically supposed to. \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, we're expected to. \nSPEAKER_07:  to handle. I just I think. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think it's much more specific if we will. \nSPEAKER_06:  I see you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  If it's unique, but I think it's something that we have to do now, given how contentious some of the council races were. \nSPEAKER_06:  If we don't start addressing it now we're not going to be in a position to have things in place. \nSPEAKER_06:  for the next time there are council races. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think there was just \nSPEAKER_06:  too many things going on and we got too many different types of feedback that I think if we don't address \nSPEAKER_06:  The electats at the same time were addressing the employees. \nSPEAKER_06:  that the residents will kind of look at scant at us. \nSPEAKER_04:  I completely agree. I think they're the general \nSPEAKER_04:  the citizens of the community think that we just missed the mark. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I'm only suggesting \nSPEAKER_07:  that for this first round of \nSPEAKER_07:  discussion. Not \nSPEAKER_07:  not for very, very long, but we can just make it a whole separate group right now. \nSPEAKER_09:  I would, I mean, I agree that it is important. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think maybe chairwise I was thinking the same. \nSPEAKER_09:  in terms of like it's less of a clear. \nSPEAKER_09:  scope of work and the other two committees are for me. \nSPEAKER_09:  I feel like, um, I'm just recognizing how potentials and elections are. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm not so clear on what. \nSPEAKER_09:  exactly with the tackling in that subcommittee. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, it's good. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, it's good. \nSPEAKER_07:  Like we're not gonna tackle. \nSPEAKER_07:  contracting right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  but we obviously will be kind. \nSPEAKER_07:  They kept tackling it. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Well, part of what I was thinking would be that \nSPEAKER_04:  the subcommittees would not to commissioners' Pollock's play. We're not going to be able to get. \nSPEAKER_04:  anything done and any of these committees to roll anything out by the end of the year. But I do think that what can be reflected in the report. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we submit. \nSPEAKER_04:  would be kind of what our work plans or what our road map is. \nSPEAKER_04:  to address these issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  over the course of 2021. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I think in \nSPEAKER_04:  And I think, and even on this third item, I think it's going to be important to at least to begin to giving some thought to it. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm wondering whether... \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have two groups. One is looking at problems and policies. The other is looking at. \nSPEAKER_07:  what I'm gonna call the process. \nSPEAKER_07:  part of it. \nSPEAKER_07:  which would be reporting, investigating, and resolution. But we do that with an eye to the problems we know that they're going to be. \nSPEAKER_07:  which are election problems just like we've seen. \nSPEAKER_07:  contracting problems. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um, \nSPEAKER_07:  you know. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have. \nSPEAKER_07:  person now. \nSPEAKER_07:  uh \nSPEAKER_07:  personnel issues. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  and see \nSPEAKER_07:  that we just keep those in the back of our mind as we work on what I'm going to call sort of the broader things. \nSPEAKER_07:  at least just for this period of time. \nSPEAKER_07:  this period of time, which I'm really going to define as between now and our next meeting as a whole. \nSPEAKER_06:  You could start out that way and then if it looks like it's too broad, then break it out with the elected as a separate. \nSPEAKER_04:  But when it be problems that we have to identify that are either in the \nSPEAKER_04:  survey or in the audit. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, they're going to impact the problems present themselves in all three areas and shouldn't each of the subcommittees take both of those reports and start by looking at what the problems to address in their respective areas are. \nSPEAKER_04:  as opposed to having a committee that's focused on all the problems to be addressed. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think they overlap. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think you still have to get down to having the two groups dive into it. And then I almost want to say you. \nSPEAKER_08:  the two groups exchange work product. \nSPEAKER_08:  And then you work, that's how I've kind of addressed it, because we do have to have uniformity and understanding of all of it. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then you will. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I think we'll all bring something to it. And we'll quickly figure out which ones have very big parking lots and which don't. \nSPEAKER_00:  Love uh \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So where are we? So we're not talking about. \nSPEAKER_07:  two groups. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then... \nSPEAKER_07:  As we just suggested, then we sort of switch over. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes, we're back to two groups. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  What would the two groups be? \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we'll call one of them policies and one of them process. How's that? \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I guess both can be informed by what the \nSPEAKER_07:  should be informed by what the problems are that have been identified, either whether it's in the \nSPEAKER_07:  the \nSPEAKER_07:  the \nSPEAKER_07:  The CDO editors report, the reports from the consultants. \nSPEAKER_07:  or whether it's the stuff that we've heard about in connection with. \nSPEAKER_07:  Where? \nSPEAKER_07:  with recent recent elections. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  There's seven of us. Do people want to? \nSPEAKER_07:  Uh \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, we're going to end up thing I need to run if we switch, if we switch over. \nSPEAKER_07:  So for starters, how do you care how we... \nSPEAKER_07:  Anybody want to do one first starts. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would personally have an interest in doing the policies and the engagement. \nSPEAKER_04:  awareness one that first one. \nSPEAKER_04:  but I have an interest in all of them, obviously. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we all have an interest in all of it, obviously. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm obviously interested in policies in getting the written code of conduct, but \nSPEAKER_05:  Also preliminary question if there's. \nSPEAKER_05:  or on a subgroup then it's subject to the Brown Act. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is that right? That's correct. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I mean, I think we want to just have a roll up your sleeves. Somebody sit down at a computer and, uh, \nSPEAKER_05:  be working through. So I think we need to keep that in mind as to \nSPEAKER_05:  how we want to hold those discussions and whether or not which of the discussions. I mean, once we get something substantive, obviously, we'll want to share it in a commission meeting. \nSPEAKER_05:  which is public, but I think the working groups we really want to. \nSPEAKER_05:  Just talk about your things at the wall. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't agree. I think that we go ahead with public meetings for even the working groups of \nSPEAKER_06:  That's something we had talked about. \nSPEAKER_06:  is invite, I think not that this is going to be one that we're going to invite in as we do a deeper guide. \nSPEAKER_06:  but I think for transparency, say to have a public meeting that anyone can come into. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then there's no questions about how, what our process was. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think it's ethics commission and more transparent. We are the better. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if we do not, do we have to notify what we have to do three days notification before the meeting? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  And so we're probably. \nSPEAKER_04:  Looking at it. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's also consistent with how we did. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm thinking back how we did the redistricting subcommittees. Those were all public. \nSPEAKER_02:  \uace0\uace0 \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  They were. \nSPEAKER_10:  So to some extent that will also require sort of some scheduling. \nSPEAKER_10:  considerations. I think that city clerk would have to determine whether or not the council chambers looks free during the time that you're considering. \nSPEAKER_10:  and they would have to consider your agenda. \nSPEAKER_10:  A minimum of 72 hours in a day. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there too? \nSPEAKER_07:  as a practical matter is there a lot of competition for \nSPEAKER_07:  the use of this \nSPEAKER_07:  It's really the use of technology that \nSPEAKER_07:  in the city council. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  chambers that's the issue right? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, this is JT. Typically, the council chambers is pretty booked throughout the week. Most evenings, there are some mornings that are available. That's why a lot of our meetings we had like in the mornings or sometimes early and afternoons depending on what events and what other meetings are scheduled. Because we also do share the chamber with the harbor. \nSPEAKER_07:  mm hmm \nSPEAKER_07:  And there's another way. \nSPEAKER_02:  for this meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, if we weren't dependent on this technology, we obviously could just be. \nSPEAKER_07:  picking a room at the library or \nSPEAKER_07:  or something but \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  There's no other technology that we can use. \nSPEAKER_01:  So what other options like, I guess we could do it where we don't stream it online, but we can make it a meeting information available to the public. So they would be able to just call in or sign into the meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  That would be the other option and we could put the meeting information on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_01:  So then it won't be run through the council chamber and streamed on granicus. But there will be the \nSPEAKER_01:  We could do it through like WebEx resume and kind of just have people call in during the meeting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, well. \nSPEAKER_07:  If-if-if-if \nSPEAKER_07:  If there's another technology we can use it, it gives us more ability to \nSPEAKER_07:  to have meetings, you know, at \nSPEAKER_07:  and more convenient times for the members of the commission. I think that would be \nSPEAKER_07:  That would be a good idea. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  accomplishes the same. \nSPEAKER_07:  thing in terms of \nSPEAKER_07:  public. I mean, if we are meeting in person, \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  But we obviously we have more options, but also we wouldn't have everything recorded and streamed and \nSPEAKER_06:  Over the days we could just go to a room and meet. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's me. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's me. \nSPEAKER_04:  especially if we i mean i don't know what the city's protocol is bit the mean say the light new main library has some large rooms that we could actually be \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, very socially distant. \nSPEAKER_04:  if you're talking about a subcommittee. \nSPEAKER_06:  But I think then it becomes an issue also of the public. \nSPEAKER_06:  and the public access. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah, but \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, we couldn't we couldn't be sure. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I'm sure I am sure we wouldn't have been mobbed, but... \nSPEAKER_07:  at the same time. \nSPEAKER_07:  I don't think we could welcome the public. \nSPEAKER_07:  the way that we that we that we should. Can we just go to Zoom and do something like that? \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that creates the same issue as the \nSPEAKER_04:  a back in terms of live streaming. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that's the... \nSPEAKER_04:  uh \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, that's the reason why we did Zoom is I think it facilitated the breakout session. \nSPEAKER_04:  of the breakout group. \nSPEAKER_04:  that WebEx doesn't provide that option. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, same. Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, so you want to, we'll just try to work up. \nSPEAKER_07:  are we agreed we want to do them publicly and if so then we're going to \nSPEAKER_07:  try to fit this into the work of the \nSPEAKER_07:  to the schedule that \nSPEAKER_07:  is available to us. \nSPEAKER_04:  If we do, I think we should probably plan on... \nSPEAKER_04:  Let's get to a more meeting from last. \nSPEAKER_04:  and always cancel them that way. \nSPEAKER_04:  Uh \nSPEAKER_04:  We have a regular cadence and we don't. \nSPEAKER_04:  after waiting. \nSPEAKER_07:  Why don't we do this? Let's divide into committees. \nSPEAKER_07:  then JT can. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Let each committee let us know what days are available and then the groups can pick their the meeting times that work for the people on that in that group. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  all right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so I've got Commissioner Shatwell and Pollock on policy. \nSPEAKER_07:  Anybody else have preferences? \nSPEAKER_08:  I want to work on both. \nSPEAKER_08:  But do you put place me where you like? \nSPEAKER_07:  But do you put place where it plays? \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, it sounds to me like we're going to \nSPEAKER_07:  We're going to. \nSPEAKER_07:  be switching places. \nSPEAKER_07:  too. So at least I think that's a good idea. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  What what I'm going to suggest is I'm just looking at the at the roster here. So the last three in the alphabet are Maniki Paula can shot well. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I'll put you on the policy committee for now. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I'll put the remaining four of us on the \nSPEAKER_07:  on the second committee that \nSPEAKER_07:  process. \nSPEAKER_07:  the process group. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then we can switch places after that if... \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, if that makes sense. \nSPEAKER_07:  Before we go any further on this, is there any other additional public comment? JT on this matter? \nSPEAKER_01:  No, we just received the one public comment for e-comment for this item and the e-comment for general public comment. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. Do we, um, \nSPEAKER_07:  Do we need to? \nSPEAKER_07:  Take. \nSPEAKER_07:  any action on this any motion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Chair White, can I ask a... \nSPEAKER_04:  uh \nSPEAKER_04:  foundational question to the work. \nSPEAKER_02:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_04:  a logistical question. \nSPEAKER_04:  is one, this is unrelated, but JT to the extent that there is meeting time, conflicts. \nSPEAKER_04:  associated with any council chambers at least for the work of our commission. Do we have those all slated out for next year so that we can get in before other. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's just one question. \nSPEAKER_04:  But the more foundational question to our work right now, is there anybody on the city? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  who can provide some guidance and assistance in helping us develop a roadmap or work plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  and a matter that's really on. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh... works for the city that they're used to seeing \nSPEAKER_04:  if it's \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, I'm looking for tools. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we can use to kind of really chart out our work. \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't know if there's anybody and if the city has anybody or any group that really does that very well. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I can answer the Council Chamber reservation calendar. It's a running calendar. So I can just kind of look up the availability and see what's going on with the, to see what meeting times are available for everyone to meet. And then maybe kind of get idea of what the preference of mornings or afternoons of each. \nSPEAKER_01:  Each kind of subcommittee wants to do. \nSPEAKER_04:  yeah and then i would also encourage us to try that \nSPEAKER_04:  also kind of. \nSPEAKER_04:  Get ahead on 2021 for just for the all seven other as a committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  And for the second question, I can actually \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll separately reach out to Rebecca. \nSPEAKER_04:  to see what \nSPEAKER_04:  She has any suggestions on that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, and then just for some clarification for the ad hoc committees, how often and kind of what kind of a schedule do you guys want to meet on? \nSPEAKER_06:  I think to start we want to meet once a month. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um, \nSPEAKER_06:  Probably. \nSPEAKER_06:  And this is the second week of the month. \nSPEAKER_06:  probably after we meet so that we can be prepared for the next month's meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I can look into see what's available for other meetings because just to get like a set schedule, instead of trying to kind of mix and match every month. So I'll kind of see what's available. \nSPEAKER_00:  and commission in a shot where I can look into existing initiatives and pass initiatives that the city has done to see kind of all their road mapping phase and then \nSPEAKER_00:  that we can get a head on that as well for you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thanks Eric. \nSPEAKER_08:  So, Margo, I like your idea of once for the working group. I'm actually thinking maybe we could propose too. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So, we're going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  We may need more time. \nSPEAKER_08:  I don't know how long these meetings are though. \nSPEAKER_08:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_06:  Let's start the first one and then see how it. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  goes from there. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Very sounds good. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  Going back. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm \nSPEAKER_07:  Amy, do we need to pass anything, any motion? \nSPEAKER_07:  Regarding \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes, I think on this one we do need a motion and I think it would be something like a motion to create to working groups of problems and policies groups. \nSPEAKER_10:  with Commissioner Chattwell, Pollock, and Manakit. \nSPEAKER_10:  and a process investigation reporting group. I think that was what it was. \nSPEAKER_10:  with commissioners wife, Morales, dealer, and Jim Ben Adipte. \nSPEAKER_10:  with the city clerk the report on a possible scheduled date. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'll move that. \nSPEAKER_10:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do I hear a second? \nSPEAKER_05:  I'll second. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, anything further on? \nSPEAKER_07:  discussion. \nSPEAKER_07:  I will roll call vote on that please then. \nSPEAKER_01:  Mr. Day Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Chattweau. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  out. \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Mr. Morales.
