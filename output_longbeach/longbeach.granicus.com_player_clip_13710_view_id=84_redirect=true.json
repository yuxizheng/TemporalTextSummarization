        "transcript": "SPEAKER_13:  to his recommendation of hold an election for the position of Chair and Vice Chair of the Equity and Human Relations Commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you, Tony. So I will start us off. I have a fancy script here. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we're going to start with the nominations for chair and then in the elections for chair and then we'll move. \nSPEAKER_02:  after that to the elections for Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  and our city attorney here is going to help us through this process if we, you know, get off the rails. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we're going to start with open nominations. Oh, and let me share a little bit about the process. That might help folks. I see there may be some questions. So we're going to do open nominations. \nSPEAKER_02:  After every one's nominations are in, then we're going to allow those who've been nominated to share. \nSPEAKER_02:  and some remarks. \nSPEAKER_02:  After that, we'll go to public comment and then we'll go to the vote in the way that we vote as the order, the last name that was nominated, we vote on that name first. \nSPEAKER_15:  What will you have Commissioner comments as well in that process? \nSPEAKER_02:  Um... \nSPEAKER_02:  It's just the vote, right? The tailor, can you clarify? \nSPEAKER_04:  So you can have each person that's nominated, say a little something before everybody votes if you'd like. \nSPEAKER_15:  But other commissioners can't say. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Is it a discussion? I guess that's the question. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there room for discussion? \nSPEAKER_14:  Because as a voting item, we always have... \nSPEAKER_14:  Sure, sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure, sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I guess there can be space for a discussion before you call for the vote. OK, so I have to comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think I'll comment. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, everyone understand the process? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so I declare the nominations open for the Equity and Human Relations Commission Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Each member may nominate one person for chair, including yourself. \nSPEAKER_02:  These nominations do not require a second. \nSPEAKER_02:  The floor is open for nominations. \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Schultz would like to nominate, Dr. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Dr. Laura. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  President. \nSPEAKER_02:  for \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have a nomination for Dr. Lara on the floor and Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_00:  I too would like to nominate Dr. Eduardo Laya. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great. And if your commissioner is already on the floor to nominate, we don't have to share a second, but thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Are there any other nominations on the floor for chair? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing none, there being no further nominations, I declare the nominations closed for chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Dr. Lara, would you like to see a few words? \nSPEAKER_08:  So number one, I accept. Here we go. All right. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  For the while, thank you to my fellow commissioners for the nomination. I gladly accept this last month. Certainly has been one of many reflections due to many personal issues going on in life, many of which you probably can relate to without going into too much detail. But as I reflect on both equity and human relations, as it pertains to our charge, I am reminded of fellow sociologist Anthony O'Campbell's work, who focuses on the intersection of queer identities. \nSPEAKER_08:  Latinx and Philippinex immigrant identities and communities here in LA. And early in his latest book, Brown and Gay in LA, \nSPEAKER_08:  He quotes a professor of African American studies at Princeton University, Dr. Imanine Perry, from her book, Breathe, a letter to my son. And she writes, how do you become in a world bent on you not being and not becoming? And I think that question very much relates to our work here at the commission for equity. It is our job collectively to use this question as a guiding light to identify barriers toward becoming in our city. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that that quote in her work, a letter to my son, pertains to black boys and men specifically. \nSPEAKER_08:  And I use that to say that it is our job as an example. \nSPEAKER_08:  Right? \nSPEAKER_08:  to provide opportunities to \nSPEAKER_08:  Black boys to become teachers. \nSPEAKER_08:  only 2% of our teaching force. \nSPEAKER_08:  are black men. \nSPEAKER_08:  And along that same land, it is our job for girls to become scientists and engineers. \nSPEAKER_08:  It is our job for LGBTQ plus youth to have housing and support. \nSPEAKER_08:  It is our job to welcome immigrants into the city and beyond and to provide resources for their families to thrive. \nSPEAKER_08:  Earlier today, I met with a former student of wine, a mentee, although I'm not at the university anymore, but doing national work in teacher education. I met with her and \nSPEAKER_08:  She \nSPEAKER_08:  Unfortunately, recently had a situation with immigration, and her \nSPEAKER_08:  her as a result of that situation, when her parents had passed away. And I often get discourse and get challenged when it comes to migrant issues, because most people see it as a national issue. \nSPEAKER_08:  It is indeed a local issue. How are we as a city providing mental health support for this youth? \nSPEAKER_08:  Haru, we as a city providing resources needed for this whole family that will never recover from this tragic death, but hopefully can be better in some ways as they heal. \nSPEAKER_08:  And so when I think about this work, I also think of becoming in the context of human relations. And for that, I turn to \nSPEAKER_08:  Our former first lady, the Green Michelle Obama. \nSPEAKER_08:  In her own book Becoming, she says. \nSPEAKER_08:  For every door that's been open to me, I've tried to open my door to others. \nSPEAKER_08:  And here it is what I have to say, finally. \nSPEAKER_08:  Let's invite one another in. \nSPEAKER_08:  Maybe then we can begin to fear less, to make fewer wrong assumptions. \nSPEAKER_08:  to let go of the biases and stereotypes that unnecessarily divide us. \nSPEAKER_08:  Maybe we can better embrace the ways we are the same. \nSPEAKER_08:  is not about being perfect, it's not about where you get yourself in the end. There's power in allowing yourself to be heard and known and owning your unique story and I'll add because we all have your own. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm using your authentic voice, and there's grace and being willing to know and hear others. This for me is how we become. \nSPEAKER_08:  And that's the human relations component. So as we braid both equity and human relations, both from the work we've done in the past and moving forward, we have to remember that here in Long Beach, this city, our city, our community, we all have a stake in ensuring everyone has the tools necessary to become our truest and most authentic selves while breaking down barriers so that we all may fully become. \nSPEAKER_08:  That is the charge of this commission and so fellow commissioners, I thank you for this nomination and support and I welcome our work together as we tie these two central tenants of equity and human relations together So we can become a better city. Thank you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you for those beautiful words. I'm going to now call for a public comment. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioners, my name is Joana. I'm here with the Anti-Surveillance Coalition. \nSPEAKER_01:  and many other community groups that I'm involved in and have been over the years. And so I'm really excited to see that Dr. Lada has been nominated to be the chair moving forward and folks seem supportive and excited and I'm honored to hear your words. And I'm excited to hold you all accountable in the coming years. And so as you've done so much work over the last several months here and come out and spoken in support and really been an advocate alongside with us for a lot of the things that we're fighting for and really sharing a strong voice for that. I really appreciate that and I'm excited to see your leadership moving forward in the space and also in the community, right? I've seen you in the academic world. I've seen you in the community organizing world, right? And so I'm just really excited to see how you all work together and how far you all continue to take this commission and the work that we're doing as a community together. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Joanna. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  speaker please. \nSPEAKER_00:  Hello everybody, my name is Jamilette, and I'm with the Anti-Servant School of Illusion and Orale, previously known as LVRC, and now it is Orale, organizing rooted in abolition, liberation and empowerment. \nSPEAKER_00:  Happy Pride Month. \nSPEAKER_00:  I must invite all of us celebrating this month to also remember the history of current. \nSPEAKER_00:  and history surveillance of the LGBTQ community by police and the long legacy and resist against police violence. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm also here to speak in support of Dr. Ladas leadership as chair. And I would also love to see Chris Covington as co-chair. The Equity Human Relations Commission has played an important role in making sure that there was a process to listen to community members, voices, and ways that unfortunately council members have yet to do in their council chambers in regards to surveillance technology. \nSPEAKER_00:  I look forward to continuing to see the work that the equity human relation has ahead. \nSPEAKER_00:  I also hope to continue to have courageous conversations about how to keep community safe, including advocacy and seeing a surveillance free long beach, a city budget that reflects community programs priorities such as housing and the Justice Fund and not policing. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Jameela, next speaker. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hey y'all, my name, excuse me. \nSPEAKER_07:  My name is Eric Garcia, I'm pronouncing him. \nSPEAKER_07:  with Oralea formerly Long Beach and Macriureth Coalition. And I'm also here to speak favorably in favor of Dr. La Raladas, a leadership of the Equity and Human Relations Commission. I think this body, as particularly as it relates to the work on surveillance, has, as Jermel Edd mentioned, has heard us in such a way that council just refuses to, not even won't, they just outright refuse to. And I think, and that has been shown through the process of the city managers involvement through the process that the wring of the recommendations that came out of this body. And so more than anything, I think the comments sort of, in those moments, and leading up to, by Dr. La Ralada, I think to me, speak to the seriousness with which you take this work and intend to move on it. And so I just wanted to say that, and we're excited to continue to work with this commission under your leadership on critical issues, not just particular surveillance, but, and I love that you mentioned the sort of all the different ways that this body and the charge of this body really impact and can impact the way that the city of Long Beach moves. \nSPEAKER_06:  We'll see you next time. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Eric. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so you know the members of the public will close public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we will now move to Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_02:  comments. \nSPEAKER_02:  face share. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you, Chair, Croutieres. And thank you to the community for coming tonight and sharing. \nSPEAKER_15:  This is the fourth of these elections I've seen in this time frame. And I just want to say congratulations Eduardo for stepping up to this rule. And I really appreciate that. And you and I have talked about this. And I really believe that something that we can lose very easily in this commission and in any commission is continuity and history, right? So as you and I spoke, I really feel that \nSPEAKER_15:  I was trying to think about how could I? \nSPEAKER_15:  best to share what I hope for this. And so I saved it for now to say exactly what Jamilet shared. Thank you for \nSPEAKER_15:  coming up with my idea that was already in my head, which is \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  I would also hope that this could be co-chaired this year by Dr. Laura and Chris Covington. I think we're going to get to a place where one of us is going to nominate Chris for vice chair. And I think that's amazing, but I think the experience he has and he has shown over the last couple years, having that history, having that understanding of where we've been, \nSPEAKER_15:  is something that is very important to me. And so rather than because there's not one part of me that doesn't want Dr. Lara in this role, I wanted to share that if there was some way that we could \nSPEAKER_15:  asked to go that direction and have co-chairs. I think you would have that not only amazing understanding and activism from both of you, but also this history and this newness that I think could really lead this into the next world. So I just want to \nSPEAKER_15:  I want to share that. I'm probably throwing a huge wrench in the whole thing, but it's my last night, so I guess I can do that. And congratulations to you, and I hope to the next step of this. \nSPEAKER_02:  See you, Tony. Do you want to? \nSPEAKER_04:  filth \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  You knew that was it. \nSPEAKER_02:  coming. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I wish she had said this earlier. Sorry. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  What I recommend that you do is that we take a pause and that \nSPEAKER_04:  the commission votes whether it's open to having co-chairs versus a chair vice chair setup. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_00:  Plenty? A lot of people have been influenced by second. But this is different for me. Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, yeah, no. Don't worry about that part. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  She knows the difference. \nSPEAKER_04:  So... \nSPEAKER_04:  If the commission agrees that the co-chair format is how you want to move forward, then what I recommend is that \nSPEAKER_04:  You reopen nominations. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then you read, that we redo it. \nSPEAKER_04:  right that you select the people who you want to be co-chairs and you vote for the pair of people that you want to move forward. Commissioner Lara has already been selected so I think it will be it's evident nobody else proposed anyone else so it will be whether or not you want this structure or not and then I guess we can just add commissioner comington if that's what you want to do. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, we have a couple of cute up. Okay, so someone will have to make a motion to vote for it for this to move forward if it doesn't get a second, it dies. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, first time I go with Commissioner Bats. I know you cute up, but I saw her first. So Commissioner Bats. \nSPEAKER_16:  I just have to go. \nSPEAKER_16:  quick question. What's the difference between co-chair and then co-vice chair? \nSPEAKER_16:  And then if you agree on the two co-chairs, will there also be a vice chair? Just trying to get clarification on that. \nSPEAKER_15:  I mean, I can let Ms. Anderson take this, but I think that my idea was that instead of having a vice chair and a chair, you just have co-chairs that work together. I will say very clearly, Alyssa and I have worked very closely together. You've given me options to help lead and do those kinds of things. That is not always true with a commission. Sometimes a chair does their own thing. I'm not saying that will happen here, but it gives the opportunity for people to work very closely together. That's the only difference. And if that's not a title we want to use, again, I'm happy to call the vote. And if everybody says no, there are no hard feelings here. I'm just bringing up an idea that I thought might help us in the future. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Flores, did you still want to... \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, there are two come chairs. Is there will there be a vice chair? Okay, come to your Allen. \nSPEAKER_15:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Oh, there we go. Still getting used to this. \nSPEAKER_11:  I have a quick question for the city attorney. Are we under any like by law obligations as terms of the structure of the commission? \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  No, not yet. That's coming next month. \nSPEAKER_11:  No, not yet. \nSPEAKER_06:  next month. \nSPEAKER_04:  I've been trying for a little while. So you guys, you can do whatever you want. I do think that you... \nSPEAKER_04:  should set parameters about what that means to you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Typically, co-chairs share and the responsibilities equally and running the meeting and in the behind the scenes work, which there is a fair amount of. I think that you should articulate what you're all agreeing on. \nSPEAKER_04:  When we come back with bylaws, I will codify the intent of this commission and what you've adopted in those bylaws so that \nSPEAKER_04:  We have a document to reference for all of you of what you meant. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, and then my comment is that I actually think that's probably the most appropriate place that if we're gonna go down a road of changing structure, \nSPEAKER_11:  I think that this campaign process, people are campaigning thinking one thing. And I think the idea of a coach who is actually really good, and I think we could benefit from that. But I struggle with the last minute change in how we were processing that. And that didn't give us a lot of time to process it either. And so I think maybe sustaining what we have, but utilizing our by-law process to really flush that out, I think. \nSPEAKER_11:  is probably where I see it being the most fruitful in terms of the conversation. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that is an option what you could do today is adopt a chair and a vice chair and then \nSPEAKER_04:  We can bring back an item, give you guys another month to think about the structure and vote whether or not you want to make those people co-chairs. That's another option too. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  I \nSPEAKER_09:  I think somewhere in my future. \nSPEAKER_09:  I may well be a chair of a commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  Not this one. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  But examining my conscience. \nSPEAKER_09:  knowing that I would stand in the well. \nSPEAKER_09:  representing whoever I represent. \nSPEAKER_09:  to have an equal partner. \nSPEAKER_09:  means you don't have to take the black eye by yourself. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  It means that you have a real partner. \nSPEAKER_09:  in \nSPEAKER_09:  responsibility to community. \nSPEAKER_09:  and \nSPEAKER_09:  It feels better. \nSPEAKER_09:  to stand with somebody. \nSPEAKER_09:  if you're representing something controversial. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I think they have one person. \nSPEAKER_09:  There's asking a lot. \nSPEAKER_09:  Particularly. \nSPEAKER_09:  with how strongly I feel, for example, about. \nSPEAKER_09:  facial recognition. \nSPEAKER_09:  I wish all of us could stand in the well. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think one of the remedies. \nSPEAKER_09:  of standing alone. \nSPEAKER_09:  is to actually have two equal people representing a huge issue, a big problem. \nSPEAKER_09:  A great many people. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I am really... \nSPEAKER_09:  I am. \nSPEAKER_09:  very much in favor for myself. \nSPEAKER_09:  and for this commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  to have two people in the well. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, nice chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  So I get a lot of jokes over the last eight years and I bring this to every meeting but this is the Commission handbook and I'm just going to bring it up in Section C it says officer elections in term of office And each commission shall have at least two officers doesn't say that they have to be a chair of vice chair Does not say that it has can be co-chairs just says two officers So I just wanted to bring that to the chair \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  just yeah at least two. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So I don't recall which commissions I don't believe you would be the only commission with a co-chair set up. \nSPEAKER_04:  if that is any consolation to you. I don't think a lot of the commissions have that responsibility. \nSPEAKER_04:  or that structure, but it is a structure that is available to you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So, by sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Did you make a motion to \nSPEAKER_02:  changes to a \nSPEAKER_02:  Co-chair situation. \nSPEAKER_15:  or is there not a motion on the floor? There wasn't yet, but I will put a motion that we make a vote to see if the commission would like to have two co-chairs as a structure for this year. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  on that motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  That was a second. So, I'm going to share about seconds. Is there any further discussion on this before we call a vote? Oh, thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  That was a second. \nSPEAKER_15:  every day for you feel \nSPEAKER_02:  I know. Okay. Well, first let me call for public comment. Are there any members of the public who would like to make public comment on this item? \nSPEAKER_06:  I know. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. Okay. Any further discussion from the Commission on this item? \nSPEAKER_06:  I take it. \nSPEAKER_02:  commissioners. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'd like to ask Dr. Laura what his thoughts are on this. \nSPEAKER_10:  You've been kind of quiet. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  That's a good question, this is all new to him. Just like wrong. \nSPEAKER_08:  This is all new to me. I will share. \nSPEAKER_08:  that \nSPEAKER_08:  Chris and I, and I don't think it's a surprise to anyone, we have historically worked really well together, regardless of this discourse, right? And Chris and I, \nSPEAKER_08:  are \nSPEAKER_08:  grounded in community. And so I look forward to regardless of the outcome of the vote. \nSPEAKER_08:  in working. \nSPEAKER_08:  with not only the entire commission, but in particular, whether it's a chair. \nSPEAKER_08:  Vice Chair or Co-Chair situation, right? We will be working collaboratively period, right? I think that's kind of where I stand on that. But I will say this is all processing all this in real time, just like the rest of us. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Any other? \nSPEAKER_02:  discussion comments from commissioners. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I also want to acknowledge we haven't actually called for a vice chair nomination, so we're not sure who you know who's on the floor for that as well. So just want to \nSPEAKER_02:  Make that known. Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  of Commissioner Cummington. How do you feel about it? \nSPEAKER_04:  co-chairing or vice-chairing. \nSPEAKER_12:  Yes, thank you. So as we've been discussing the elections for this commission, having a leadership role has been something that I have committed to in discussing or thinking about either chair or vice chair opportunities. I had to really reflect on some specific transitions that will be happening over the summer in terms of my work capacity and also my ability to... \nSPEAKER_12:  hold the sole weight of the commission. And so my intention today was to accept, if someone is to nominate me, the vice chair role. And as Dr. Lara has mentioned, Commissioner Lara has mentioned, we do work well together. And I think in our opportunities that we've had in our ad hoc subcommittee spaces, we've been able to be thought partners, be able to exchange opportunities. Support the process along the way under the leadership of our chair. \nSPEAKER_12:  And I am open and I think if the commission decides on a co-chair structure, that is something that I would be willing to support equally with Dr. Riccardo Lyra. So thank you all. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, and come to stront. \nSPEAKER_11:  Just a procedural question again for the city attorney. So for this moves forward. \nSPEAKER_11:  I heard you say in pairs. So do we have to do two people at once have to be nominated and we're voting up and down on a pair of people or \nSPEAKER_11:  If there are, let's say, six people nominated, is it just the top two vote getters that are would be deemed co-chairs? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I take back what I said. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm trying to work through how to pull this out for you guys. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're all on the fly here. \nSPEAKER_04:  We're all on the fly here, so. Yeah, we're all aiming just like. Woo. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, so it wouldn't be... \nSPEAKER_04:  It would be the top two people that had the most votes. I think we would handle it in the same way. \nSPEAKER_04:  that the chair mentioned. So \nSPEAKER_04:  nominations would we reopen nominations for co-chair? Actually, we just open nominations for co-chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then \nSPEAKER_04:  Everybody would be nominated. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then we would go moving backwards up. \nSPEAKER_04:  through each person and then the two with the most votes would be the one, two. \nSPEAKER_04:  to be co-chairs. \nSPEAKER_10:  Got it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, so the top two vote getters. \nSPEAKER_10:  to \nSPEAKER_15:  But we haven't started a nomination for Cochariot. We're just going to see if we want to have a vote. Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, so right I was just trying to figure out like yeah, if you guys agree. Yeah, I apologize. I misspoke earlier so \nSPEAKER_11:  Right, I was just trying to figure out, like, yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  That is what I meant. That is not what I said. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, any final questions, comments from commissioners? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, seeing none. \nSPEAKER_02:  my shirtshirts. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. Seeing them, can we get a roll call vote? And we're just to clarify. We're voting on \nSPEAKER_02:  having co-chair, doing a co-chair election right now. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_16:  now. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Bats. \nSPEAKER_16:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Camacho. \nSPEAKER_13:  abstain. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Cubington. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Gillette. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Wada. \nSPEAKER_08:  Can I speak before I go? \nSPEAKER_08:  No. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I think struggling with real things. Thank you very much. But that's it. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Montgomery. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  No. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Schultz. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  uh, Vice-Chair Erickson. \nSPEAKER_15:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Cherlau-tiertres. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm staying. \nSPEAKER_13:  3F7, yes. And 2Nose and 3Fstein. \nSPEAKER_02:  submission passes \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  with some emotion caminho. \nSPEAKER_04:  How many? \nSPEAKER_04:  on this commission. I can't bother with this. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  which will speak to the team. \nSPEAKER_04:  which will speak the 10th. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Motion\u00fd nothing wet. \nSPEAKER_13:  eight is eight yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  And yes. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Mr. Beyeak. \nSPEAKER_15:  Will we go? \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  15 seats. \nSPEAKER_04:  So it's a vote. \nSPEAKER_13:  It's a vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's fair. \nSPEAKER_13:  It's fails. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you for the time being in the process. \nSPEAKER_02:  Am I able to make a comment about this or is that part closed? \nSPEAKER_05:  part closed. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, and at the next meeting, we're going to be creating bylaws. Is that right? \nSPEAKER_02:  and there is an opportunity at that time. \nSPEAKER_02:  two \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry about that. \nSPEAKER_02:  to merge, that are going through this process to vote. \nSPEAKER_02:  to merge the chair and by steering to co-chairs. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, so at the next meeting what we're going to have is a request for me to draft bylaws for you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  I have standard terms that we generally give for commissions. You'll have an opportunity to review what those are. \nSPEAKER_04:  For example, \nSPEAKER_04:  Most commissions don't allow extensions. \nSPEAKER_04:  from the vote if you're here you got to participate. So, but at that time you will also have a opportunity to \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  merge, co-chair, vice chair and chair into co-chair if you'd like. You don't have to do it today. \nSPEAKER_04:  Like I said, you can think about it, you can make that choice when you write your bylaws. If down the line you decide that that's a structure that you want, we can just amend your bylaws. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's an easy fix. It's like a two-meeting thing. When you adopt the resolution, it's done. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I just, I, I think I heard enough of like this was hasty perhaps because I don't disagree with the idea. I actually would love to vote yes, when this comes back, but I, \nSPEAKER_02:  I think it's just one of those things that we deserve to sit with. \nSPEAKER_02:  a little, you know, to... \nSPEAKER_02:  Let it marinate. \nSPEAKER_02:  instead of making a decision that. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, we just were presented with. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know 10 minutes ago. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Bats. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we're back on this process though, right? Is that so I just want to pretty now? \nSPEAKER_04:  So now we need to vote on chair. Okay, but I believe Commissioner Baile. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's Commissioner Ratzas, cut up. So we're still in this process of Commissioner Commons for the Chair vote now. OK. \nSPEAKER_16:  Oh, okay, I just had one question on the co-chair. \nSPEAKER_16:  Um, if \nSPEAKER_16:  We do them in the bylaws. \nSPEAKER_16:  Is it a option meaning we could still just vote one person as chair. We don't have to have a co-chair. I just want to I just want to make it be clear like we're just putting in there that we want the option to have a co-chair. But it could be that we end up with just a chair and a vice chair one year. \nSPEAKER_16:  I just want to make sure that that's... \nSPEAKER_16:  what we're saying. \nSPEAKER_04:  So right now what you're voting on. \nSPEAKER_04:  is to put a chair and a vice chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  If down the line at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  six months from now, you guys decide that you want \nSPEAKER_04:  a co-chair structure. \nSPEAKER_04:  We can amend your bylaws at that point to allow for that structure instead. And whatever \nSPEAKER_04:  That means to you and how you want it to operate. So right now the decision is chair and vice chair. Because the motion failed, the co-chair, am I answering your question? \nSPEAKER_16:  Well, what I'm saying is, are we going to have an either or option, meaning in the bylaws? In the bylaws. Or in the bylaws. Um, is that an option to have in the bylaws? \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  in the bylaws. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_16:  you \nSPEAKER_16:  meaning we may have two strong people like we do now that want that we want as co-chairs, but maybe three years from now we just have one strong leader but we want the option to just have chair vice chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I can write it in a way that if that's what you guys want, that by vote you can agree to the chair, co-chair structure. \nSPEAKER_04:  but you can return it by vote to vice chair and chair structure rather than amending the bylaws. I just, I recommend amending the bylaws because \nSPEAKER_00:  hollowly and continue to \nSPEAKER_04:  When I'm not here and you're not here, all the things that you intended for this commission to be in how it operates like \nSPEAKER_04:  that document will memorialize that intent. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's always better to have it in one place than like emotion down the line. \nSPEAKER_04:  But it is an option if that's something that you would prefer. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. And then Taylor, I think there's confusion because I thought that seven would have meant that it passed. I think there's some confusion over it. So because it's matured. 15. You're matured. \nSPEAKER_03:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  15 people on the commission. It's half a 15 plus one. Half a 15 is seven and a half. That means you need eight votes for something to pass. \nSPEAKER_14:  It's over 50%. \nSPEAKER_04:  God it. It's 50% of whose present? No, it's 15% of the seeds. So what the rule is is 50% plus one. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_14:  It's fine. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  not who's \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Come and check. \nSPEAKER_15:  I will just jump in for a second because I think the reason this is confusing. And this is learning that we've done over the last two years is it's not, these are not rules that we lived by say five, four, three years ago because we didn't have staff that were teaching us, we didn't have city attorney with us to teach us these places. So we used to go based on how many people were at a meeting versus how many people were supposed to be on and that's laid out very clearly in the commission to handbook. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, and we'll put it in your violence too so that it's not. I know it's been an issue for this commission. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  I know it's. \nSPEAKER_04:  This is also why I feel very strongly that we should get you bylaws. \nSPEAKER_04:  So \nSPEAKER_04:  that you have a document that you guys can look to on your own and know beyond the Commissioner Handbook of like how this Commission operates. \nSPEAKER_02:  So then, and I also heard you say that we're not, if we're present at the meeting, then we're not supposed to abstain. So should we redo this vote? \nSPEAKER_04:  so you don't have a rule in place. \nSPEAKER_04:  that requires you to vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  which means that you're allowed to abstain. Other commissions that I work with have a rule. If you're present, you can abstain unless the commission agrees that you can abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Or there's an obvious reason of the minutes, right? You didn't have a chance to review the minutes. You weren't at the meeting. That's a logical extension. So it's something that we can talk about. I don't want to, we're getting very... \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ralph Brown's gonna haunt me tonight. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm... \nSPEAKER_11:  after every meeting. Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, he does. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I don't want to get too far off topic, but we're going to talk about this. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next meeting, so like think about the kind of rules that you want for this commission. \nSPEAKER_04:  You can give me that feedback before I go write your bylaws and assume \nSPEAKER_04:  that you want the things that other commissions do. And so when we go to \nSPEAKER_04:  I will bring them back and you'll have an opportunity to amend them if you don't like it, right? So we can talk about it at that time. \nSPEAKER_02:  can talk about. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  I see two queued up and then hopefully move to the vote. So Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah, just to clarify, because there's only 13 seated members. \nSPEAKER_11:  of the like better listed on our agenda, right? \nSPEAKER_11:  Not 15. \nSPEAKER_11:  It's... \nSPEAKER_06:  It's seeds. \nSPEAKER_11:  So it's, so we're governed completely different than the council is. Like our appointing body, the city council doesn't operate that way. If there's nine members of the council, there's not the majority vote is not based on nine seats. It's based on present and voting. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this is something that my office has talked through. \nSPEAKER_11:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_04:  And for commissions, it is different, I guess, than council. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  But it's... \nSPEAKER_04:  It seats, not because the council intentionally put however many seats so \nSPEAKER_04:  It's measured by seats and that's the rule. \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  and it's supposed to be applied consistently across all of the commissions. So I think \nSPEAKER_11:  So how does it nuance, I guess, across, I mean, against the council on us, like... \nSPEAKER_11:  We're all governed by the same rules and brown acts. \nSPEAKER_03:  I can talk to my office about it. I'm the messier. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm the messier. So confused now. \nSPEAKER_03:  But that's the rule. So. \nSPEAKER_11:  got it. So it has nothing, it's strictly on the 15. \nSPEAKER_11:  potential seats that we have. So even if there were four people here. \nSPEAKER_11:  theoretically nothing would ever pass. \nSPEAKER_04:  You wouldn't have a quorum. \nSPEAKER_11:  That's true too. So, okay, that's, thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  lol \nSPEAKER_09:  You're right, I'll just have to go. \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm not going to see I told you so, but y'all want a 21 commissioners. \nSPEAKER_06:  That one. \nSPEAKER_10:  At one point, every member of that. \nSPEAKER_10:  Since I was the last cute up, I would like to ask our chairperson to call. \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  the nominations for Vice Chair. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. So let's go ahead and move to our vote. For a chair, we have one nomination on the floor. Dr. Lara, city clerk, please. \nSPEAKER_13:  Okay Commissioner Allen \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_16:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Bats. \nSPEAKER_16:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Kamatra. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Coveington. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Flores. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Gillette? \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Rulada. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Can we share my gum ring? \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_09:  abstain. \nSPEAKER_13:  Commissioner Schultz. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. Vice Chair Erickson. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yes. Chalcuteras. Yes. Motion passes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Congratulations to the newly elected chair. And we do have to allow any comments from the elected chair. We are running very light on time. \nSPEAKER_06:  Cheers! \nSPEAKER_08:  For all, thank you for selecting me as your next chair. As you heard earlier, I take the two central charges for this commission, not only seriously, but making sure that we braid them together. And as we march forward with denominations of the vice chair, making sure that we work collaboratively is a great deal. \nSPEAKER_08:  key in moving the work forward. So I appreciate the lively discussion, the democratic process, comments from the public, and we will move together in the spirit of both equity and human relations. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, so we are moving on to vice chair nominations. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I now declare the nominations open for the Equity and Human Relations Commission Vice Chair. Each member may nominate one person for Vice Chair including yourself. And these nominations do not require a second. And I see Vice Chair Erickson Q. \nSPEAKER_15:  Yeah, I would love to nominate Chris Cuffington as our next vice chair of this commission excited to, well, it won't be on the commission if you ever need anything or the next vice chair needs anything. I'm excited to be here for you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  any other nominations for Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  Dr. Larry, you're cute up, but I eat. \nSPEAKER_08:  I was going to nominate Adam as well, but I will coast. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, so I invite Commissioner Covington to briefly share why you'd like to be elected vice chair. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. I really appreciate the nomination for Vice Chair, thank you Vice Chair, and the co-sign, Dr. Lara. I am really interested in being in leadership of this commission when I was thinking about, \nSPEAKER_12:  supporting my community. \nSPEAKER_12:  I was like, how can I do best? And the best way that I could do that is as a community organizer and really uplifting the voice of those most impacted by the issues. And it wasn't until my current council member became a council member where they tapped me and said, we need a voice on the commission and we want that voice to be you. And so once I was tapped, I decided to serve in that capacity. \nSPEAKER_12:  As a community organizer fighting for a lot of the issues that communities want to see, it's often not in line with what council members want or what their special interests want to see in the city. And so there are times where I disagree with my current council member and I do that because I know who I'm doing that for. I'm doing that for the folks who are not able to show up to the meetings for those who are deemed voiceless or not to the standard of supporting and also by building community. And so by stepping up and saying that I want to be in a leadership role for this commission, I really want to help our commission really lean on the voices of our community to move their agenda forward through our facilitation. And so I'm looking forward to stepping into this role and I really appreciate everybody's support. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. We're now going to move to public comment. Are there any members of the public who wish to make public comment on this nomination? \nSPEAKER_01:  Good evening again commissioners. I'm really excited to hear Chris, Commissioner Chris Covington, that you've been nominated for Vice Chair. As you mentioned, right, your grassroots organizing background, I can speak to, I've seen you in the community in some of my contemporary organizations that I've done work with over the years. And so I'm really excited to see you stepping up into this role. I've seen you support and speak up and speak out in this space continuously and consistently. I've seen you attend council meetings on behalf of the anti-surveillance pieces that you all wanna uplift here as a commission. And so I'm really thankful for that and I'm excited and again, just that accountability and follow through and consistency. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Please stay happy, Gurpati. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Same. Okay. But I do really just want to echo that we have seen you at Council and we've like during the debriefs because you know we try to mobilize folks and so we touch base after the fact. And so during the debriefs we do appreciate commissioners who come to Council to speak on behalf of like in their capacity as commissioners for the city on issues that are related to stuff that y'all are talking about in here. And so we've seen you and I'm. \nSPEAKER_07:  So actually being unfamiliar with the process, I had already prepared a public comment and like to speak favorably of your vice chair or like one of the two officer positions. So I'm grateful and look forward to working with you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  next speaker. \nSPEAKER_00:  I would like to echo everything that has been mentioned. Oh, by the way, my name is Demi Lett and I would also want to highlight that that is key that you're recognizing that what happens at City Council is most of the time not in favor of what community needs. So I hope with like you taking the citizenship role within the commission, that remains and that. \nSPEAKER_00:  We continue to work together in community and continue to push for folks that are most marginalized because they are many voices. They're just not heard in here because they've never been welcomed here. And you know that, so it's great to hear that. So yeah, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Great, thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Any other members of the public? Was it to make public comment? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, seeing none, I'm going to close out public comment and move to Commissioner comments. Are there any comments from the commission on this nomination, Dr. Bats? \nSPEAKER_16:  I just wanted to say that I'm really excited. The two of you will make an awesome \nSPEAKER_16:  co-chair or chair, vice chair, whichever way it goes. You both have definitely unique. \nSPEAKER_16:  human and social capital contributions that will be beneficial to leading us in this committee. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Commissioner and Dr. Lara. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner Coveington's nomination is \nSPEAKER_08:  exciting. I have known and I can't even keep track of how long I've known Chris but I've known him for a while. In particular through the community work and I can go on and on and list a bunch of different organizing events that I've seen Commissioner coming to that. But what I really want to highlight is his dedication. This is just one though. Dedication of youth. And that is something that he and I share in uplifting diverse youth in our communities through either education work through development through championing their causes whether it's this body or the district body or any other type of space. Chapning youth is something that is just not only close to my heart but I see it as central part of his organizing efforts. And not to mention his work with LGBTQ plus community and other communities but I thank you for that and I look forward to working collaboratively with you as I mentioned before. I can't stress that enough in gathering all the diverse viewpoint not only of his body but through our community and making our issues not only known to move forward whether it's policy recommendations advocacy work with City Council and looking other ways that we can extend our right potentially with that hot committee. So thank you for that and I appreciate the campaign. You didn't call campaign work but it was the similar to campaign work that you did with our last meeting. I mean you led that very well and I appreciate the organizing efforts that went to that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Come and share our air. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you so much. I just want to say the reason I'm excited about this duo. \nSPEAKER_15:  is \nSPEAKER_15:  is this commission used to be the only commission that had disruptors. I don't think that's true anymore. I think there are other commissioners in other commissions that are doing that work. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think there are. \nSPEAKER_15:  In this room, one of my favorite disruptors does things very differently than I do. But this is why I did this today. \nSPEAKER_15:  I just want us to think about. \nSPEAKER_15:  how we do the work because the chance to write bylaws is very exciting. Four years ago, I left chair. \nSPEAKER_15:  And when to vice chair, I said the mission work that we just did needs to be codified in some bylaws for this commission and it's very exciting to me that. \nSPEAKER_15:  in the next few months you'll get to vote on how you want to do these kinds of things. But this kind of disruption is not meant to harm. I just want to make sure everybody understands that. It is not meant to. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  Um, \nSPEAKER_15:  stop anything from happening, it's just meant to remind us that there are lots of ways out there to do it, and these are great people to be able to take on these new mantles, and I am honored to be able to pass it. The work that I've done here as leadership to the two of you in these ways, so thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. Thank you, Vice Chair. \nSPEAKER_02:  And Amy has been a leader in this commission for a very long time in many different capacities.

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  item number three is recommendation to discuss future meeting locations for the equity and human relations commission. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. And I believe you have a few options for us. Is that right? OK. So are you going to send it over to you? OK. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a quick presentation for you all just based on some research we've done. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is good? OK, perfect, yeah. I'm a solo act. OK, so we did a little bit of research. So again, item three. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh no. \nSPEAKER_02:  There we go. Item three again, it's recommendation to discuss the future meeting locations for the Equity and Human Relations Commission. So we've entered a total of 18 locations, which included parks, libraries, health centers, and then additional locations. I'm rushing through this for a sake of time. So anyway, some locations were unavailable to host us. For example, these parks are not available to host us because it conflicts with summer programming. All of the libraries are unavailable to host us because they close during our meeting times. And then one location, we're still waiting to hear confirmation unavailability. \nSPEAKER_02:  Let's talk about the places that are able to possibly host future meetings. So the Miller Health Family Center is able to possibly host a meeting for us. Some notes, we used to, the Equity Human Relations Commission used to meet there before in the past. I also want to point out some, just some details, meaning that the building is in need of major reparations, major repairs. We will be needing AVS technical support to meet at that facility. And also, there is a fee associated with using that space. \nSPEAKER_02:  We also are able to use recreation park social hall, which is located in East Long Beach. However, they're not available for our meeting, for our August meeting. And again, we would need technical support at that location. \nSPEAKER_02:  The Ronald Areas Health Center is available. It accommodates 30 to 35 people. However, there is a rental fee associated with that space as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  The civic chambers are available, but we've had those conversations before and we know how you will feel about it, but again, those are available. A positive of that is that people are able to participate virtually, but I know that it makes it difficult to hear when we're in that space. \nSPEAKER_02:  Energy resources auditorium is also available. However, there is also an after hours coverage fee associated with using that space. And the place comfortably accommodates about 40 people. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then LBCC currently is working, we're so currently working with the manager, Jay Lopez, to identify a space at either of the campuses, either liberal arts in Lakewood Village or Pacific Coast Campus in Central Long Beach. Again, there is a rent of fee associated with using this space. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then lastly, we reached out to the Long Beach Unified School District, and they don't have any meeting rooms at their office, but they mentioned that if we're able to identify one of the schools, then we can identify a space to meet there. So currently the office of equity needs to coordinate directly with the school sites to confirm availability. There's a total of 80 schools available for us to look into. Again, something to take note of is that there is a reservation fee associated with using that space, any of those spaces. And A, B, or technical support will probably be needed at most of those spaces as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I wanted to kind of map out except for the unified, except for the 80 locations of the unified school district. The stars are really, they just represent in the map where the other locations can possibly be. So you have an idea of where they are. And then, \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, that was really fast. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  So I think first, do we know motion is like a two-begin discussion? That's not right. And we will go to public comment, but I don't know. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Someone who doesn't understand Copyright please thumbs up. \nSPEAKER_10:  I move to receive and file the report on potential meeting site locations. Exactly. \nSPEAKER_11:  Second. All right. Thank you. Commissioner. \nSPEAKER_11:  Camacho made a motion. Commissioner Allen seconds. Okay. So I have a few clarifying questions and then we can move to public comment. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I'm wondering. \nSPEAKER_11:  for all of those different locations that you just shared. \nSPEAKER_11:  hybrid. \nSPEAKER_11:  option, the option for community members to \nSPEAKER_11:  participate remote. \nSPEAKER_11:  is only available. \nSPEAKER_11:  in one of them. Is that correct? \nSPEAKER_02:  The Chamber is the only option of all the 18 locations I've vetted that offers a possibility to have hybrid interaction with community. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  I think that was my main clarifying question, and with that, I'm going to move to public comment and then we'll all. \nSPEAKER_11:  Well, moving to discussion. Are there any members of the public who'd like to make public comment? \nSPEAKER_05:  Hey, Eric, excuse me, I'm an ignorance, but I guess the question is specific to the school districts. Wouldn't the city be able to waive the cost because it's theirs? \nSPEAKER_05:  No. \nSPEAKER_11:  Great question. Great question. \nSPEAKER_12:  No questions. \nSPEAKER_11:  Any other public comment? \nSPEAKER_08:  Good evening everyone, my name is Joanna. I really appreciate the breakdown. It's really helpful. I am a little concerned about the lack of options for hybrid opportunities, just because I know that's something we've talked about. I feel that it is a priority for community folks. We've done several public comments around this in terms of accessibility and all of that good stuff. So just wanted to ensure that we keep that at the forefront of our minds as we're vetting potential locations. Thank you. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Any other public comment? \nSPEAKER_01:  I mean, here. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, I just also wanted to. \nSPEAKER_07:  support the comments about. \nSPEAKER_07:  In addition to that, we know one of the barriers for people to show up at just council meetings is that there is in child care, right? \nSPEAKER_07:  And so with hybrid like \nSPEAKER_07:  There's mothers that are cooking dinner home can still chime in. Be part of the conversation. \nSPEAKER_07:  And as you know, when we were hybrid, participation had actually increased from community at the City Council chambers and at the equity and community relations commissions. So it's not that community doesn't doesn't want to be heard. It's just like \nSPEAKER_07:  folks have are limited, they're after work hours and they have children. And so \nSPEAKER_07:  I think it's like even if that's the only option, like I would just challenge the commission to make a mission to really consider hybrid meetings as a long-term goal to make it more accessible to community, even if that is not the short-term solution. \nSPEAKER_11:  Absolutely. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, seeing no other public comment, I'm closing public comment, and moving to Commissioner Discussions, vice chair. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, okay, thanks. I apologize for not getting to you sooner, Tony. I had two more places that I was gonna tell you about, so I'm just gonna bring them here. My life kinda got away from me this month. So the, I forget what the name of it is, that's why I pulled it up here. It's called The Housels and Venn Dyke Theater at Miller Hospital. It's a pretty, it's very nice, like public auditorium space, it has a, a dius and has lots of technology available to it. And I would love you to vet them as well. And if you get to a place where there's a fee, I would like to talk to the board about it at Miller, because I think this is important enough. I also agree with the, \nSPEAKER_01:  the public that I just think as we can think of centrally. \nSPEAKER_01:  to me, Miller is kind of central to our community. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was excited to see. \nSPEAKER_01:  Rec Park up here which is not really central but that's a very big room. We spent a lot of time as a commission in the little room and grand. \nSPEAKER_01:  So where there was no room for anyone else to be in there, so we don't want to do that again. But I think that other place, and I think that we did talk about is, \nSPEAKER_01:  PCC campus and I'm hoping that something will come through there and again I would like to go to the board of trustees and ask for a waiver on fees which I know we can do And there is a room in the eye building at PCC just south of the big parking lot That could hold easily 40 members of the public and our commission and I've seen work zoom so I know that it has that capability So let me know if I can help with any of those \nSPEAKER_11:  Can I show Laura? \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Ricks and I actually really appreciate those recommendations because it's connected to the issue that I want to uplift which is the community's request Wherever we land there should right with the support of the commissioners be some sort of hybrid option I know that even from a research standpoint \nSPEAKER_04:  various communities, historically marginalized communities, do have a hard time attending and the more access that we can provide through online mediums, I think that bodes will especially give in our responsibilities as a commission. And I will share, just kind of in sharp conscious, I know that this space is an necessarily an option because of summer programming, but from a personal standpoint. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right? This is an example of a community space that really resonates with folks, but yet even then there are barriers to attending. So as much as I may personally like this space, if this were an option, because if over me, I'm like, let's meet here, I love this space. But it's central Long Beach, it just conveys the sense of belonging, I love it. \nSPEAKER_04:  but it doesn't have that hybrid option. So... \nSPEAKER_04:  I think the more we explore and have options. \nSPEAKER_04:  in hybrid and have only those be the options that we choose from, I think that's going to be better as we move to a final location. The other thing I want to get ahead of, I know sometimes there are suggestions for rotating across the city and those suggestions are rationalized through \nSPEAKER_04:  through a perspective of wanting to be equitable, which I got, right? However, sometimes when we rotate across the city, we unintentionally create barriers without having consistency. Right? People assume, oh, I even have to double check, right? As a commissioner, wait, where are we meeting? Where are we going? Oh, that's right, and I'll check three times, okay, that's where I'm going, right? Out of concern, then I might be driving the city hall when I'm supposed to be over here. So, I want to get ahead of that in the event that that's a recommendation, which of course, we're willing to entertain, but. \nSPEAKER_04:  spreading out and rotating does create other challenges. I think the community, if I were to take a best guess, would probably prefer consistency over rotating spaces. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  you \nSPEAKER_14:  And I had to double check tonight to make sure I was going to the right spot. So I second that idea. \nSPEAKER_14:  right? I mean for a question for Tony, so I know on the list of unavailable was the park, but is this particular theater space part of that unavailability or is a separate from that? \nSPEAKER_02:  Correct. So this space is also part of summer programming so it's also another thing. \nSPEAKER_14:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_14:  And then I guess one of the things I'm thinking through is like how we engage the community, right? And there are community like partners and helping us identify spaces as well that, you know, to the point that we're talking about of making sure our accessibility is key to the communities and the constituencies that we're trying to serve of bringing them into that conversation as well as we continue to look because there are a ton of community nonprofits that have spaces and, you know, maybe we kind of have looked a lot on the city side and the more legislative government side, but maybe there are some \nSPEAKER_14:  community spaces that we may not either be aware of or not be considering yet. That might be an option for us as well. And I just want to echo the parts of ensuring that wherever we go to the best of our ability we are trying to bring this hybrid model in because I mean I know there are some hurdles but it feels like it can't be that hard. \nSPEAKER_14:  to try to bring that into wherever we're going. I mean, if we can do presentations and we've got great devices, maybe there are hurdle or two, but I would really want to push us to identify what that looks like so that we can bring that sooner rather than later. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, Commissioner Coveington. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you, Chair. I have a question for staff and Tony. Is the objective of the presentation to come back next month to help us identify a location? Or \nSPEAKER_03:  like \nSPEAKER_03:  What are the next steps? Are we on a timeline to choose a location? \nSPEAKER_02:  The purpose of the presentation was just to engage, to have the office of equity, to engage in some research and come to the table with some potential options of where to meet. The conversation of finding and meeting space has been ongoing for a few months, so we just wanted to support that by providing research and some options for you to decide on, you get to decide on the next steps and where you want to go from here. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, thank you for the clarification. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  In our last meeting, I know towards the end of the evening, we actually had folks from tech answer some of our questions about what are the requirements in order to provide the hybrid function and support. And so from my memory in our last conversation, the issue is specifically the Wi-Fi connection. So as we're looking at the options for us to call home in the future, I would like to understand exactly what the Wi-Fi requirement is for staff or for tech and then assess if the building is able to provide that. That would be helpful because, \nSPEAKER_03:  If we know exactly what we need in order to have the hybrid, let's just work to make that happen. So, I know here we talk about, you know, Wi-Fi and Park equity, I think we could work with our City Council member in the Sixth District to say, what can we do to \nSPEAKER_03:  beef up the infrastructure here to have the hybrid. So my recommendation or ask? \nSPEAKER_03:  because I don't feel like I need to make a motion on this, is to include the requirement from tech of what exactly is needed to meet the hybrid function. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, the office, if I could, it can conduct a stop report on the technical needs to make hybrid happen. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we can report back on our findings. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. Commissioner Schultz. \nSPEAKER_06:  First of all, thank you, Tony. That was quite a show of tell. \nSPEAKER_06:  You've been all around town. \nSPEAKER_06:  And you did your research and I really appreciate. \nSPEAKER_06:  you're taking our suggestions and going out and finding other. \nSPEAKER_06:  possible locations. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  I hope that we can vote on a new location tonight. \nSPEAKER_06:  This is the second we've had. \nSPEAKER_06:  where every single member of the public, we pulled them last, Commissioner Laura asked. \nSPEAKER_06:  Chairman-elect Laura asked. \nSPEAKER_06:  of much larger selection. \nSPEAKER_06:  not better, but much larger selection of every single one of them, and every single person of the public on prompter today said that they want a hybrid model. \nSPEAKER_06:  city hall. \nSPEAKER_06:  has no rental fee. \nSPEAKER_06:  City for Hall has an in place ready to go hybrid option. They have a whole it's called LBTV. Is anybody familiar with LBTV? \nSPEAKER_06:  because the two guys that run it are sitting behind me right now. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, should I raise your hand and give him some love? \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  So they have a hybrid in place. They have parking. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  Something in the hybrid it's not just broadcasting. \nSPEAKER_06:  The meeting. We could broadcast the meeting from anywhere. It's the two-way communication. \nSPEAKER_06:  and within that two-way communication. \nSPEAKER_06:  If you really are serious about equity. \nSPEAKER_06:  Translators are a big part of that. \nSPEAKER_06:  and to try to take that show on the road. \nSPEAKER_06:  and build that structure in a small room in a big room in a room anywhere other than a chambers. \nSPEAKER_06:  is a struggle and I would ask. I would ask. \nSPEAKER_06:  our TV studio people here. First of all, I want to thank you guys for coming out. \nSPEAKER_06:  and making us look \nSPEAKER_06:  look very professional. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  But there was a time when the City Council \nSPEAKER_06:  Get a road show. \nSPEAKER_06:  four or five years ago and they went to McBride and Paulie. They took it on the road each district. \nSPEAKER_06:  and LBTV people, if you can hear me. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um. \nSPEAKER_06:  Wasn't there a considerable cost? \nSPEAKER_06:  for that. \nSPEAKER_06:  You gotta have a microphone back there. \nSPEAKER_06:  Come on out and introduce yourself. Will you? \nSPEAKER_06:  You come out, you come out too. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  I don't know what the exact cost was because what you're referring to was the redistricting meetings. So the clerk's staff handled the cost of that. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  These are from LBTV. \nSPEAKER_06:  No, it was actually the City Council had council meetings. We did one meeting in front of the council. \nSPEAKER_13:  We did one reading in a bride. We never went to pop. Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, okay. \nSPEAKER_13:  I mean, we went out. \nSPEAKER_13:  before I started here 10 years ago so you might be referring to the so back \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I think what you're I know what you're trying to my understanding is that part of the reason the city stopped doing it is because it was very expensive to take the show on the road and transmit the meetings. \nSPEAKER_13:  We're playing tonight. \nSPEAKER_13:  in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_13:  I can speak to them, it was expensive because we had to virtually stream that and that was a considerable cost. \nSPEAKER_06:  And the Wi-Fi is terrible there. My son goes to McBride. It was also difficult. \nSPEAKER_13:  It was also difficult, yes. That's why we brought in our own vendor that did all that. But you know, the exact number I couldn't tell you, but I know it was considerable. \nSPEAKER_06:  I spoke of some of the things that are required, some of the logistics that are required in a two-way broadcast. \nSPEAKER_13:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there anything that I missed or that you can speak to or? \nSPEAKER_06:  and a manage to having it at City Hall. \nSPEAKER_13:  and advantage. \nSPEAKER_13:  That's pretty much it. It's the built-in situation. We would love to take it on the road, but there's a lot of logistical parts for us to figure that part out. There's no dependable Wi-Fi here. And so Commissioner Covington asked about the actual level. That can vary, but typically you want to have upwards of 10 megs going both ways. And typically what a lot of people have found during COVID. \nSPEAKER_13:  is it bad, great? \nSPEAKER_13:  Download speed so you can \nSPEAKER_13:  Pull stuff down, but when you're upload, your upload would be the two eggs. And so when you saw people talking, \nSPEAKER_13:  You didn't see them very quickly because our blow is being slow. And so that is our concern. And other locations is the upload could be very slow for the community. So there's a lot of technical aspects of it. That's our concern. And there's an issue I shared with Taylor that during COVID, and we're not sure on the long now, but during COVID, if the tech failed during a meeting, \nSPEAKER_13:  Yeah, just stop the meeting. \nSPEAKER_13:  You could not move, you could not go on. \nSPEAKER_13:  So I don't know if that's a crit log. \nSPEAKER_13:  No. \nSPEAKER_09:  No. \nSPEAKER_13:  No, I don't get changed. \nSPEAKER_09:  No, I don't get checked. Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  And all of the meetings that are \nSPEAKER_13:  That was our other concern. All of \nSPEAKER_09:  Hybrid now have a disclosure on the top that the meeting will continue. Public comment will be in person if there's a disruption. So whoever is on \nSPEAKER_09:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  Zoom, they're just out of the meeting. \nSPEAKER_06:  We spoke after the meeting last time and we spoke about was the very poor \nSPEAKER_06:  speaker system in the chamber. \nSPEAKER_12:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_06:  Apparently, he's spent all money on a TV screen somewhere else in the building. I don't know. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  But \nSPEAKER_06:  Was that being addressed? Was that being fixed? \nSPEAKER_13:  That is currently being worked on, yes, I don't have a time for any. \nSPEAKER_06:  The problems that, where you have problems hearing, is that from the dius, is that from the well, or is that in the audience, or is it a mixture of all? \nSPEAKER_13:  Yeah, it's, I mean, that's a long conversation. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_13:  Could headphones be... \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_13:  provided I believe \nSPEAKER_06:  provided I believe that headphones plug into these. \nSPEAKER_13:  There's also a hearing loop so they're in the ground so that could also pick up some of the mics themselves. Yeah, the speakers are not what I would prefer. I'll leave it at that. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  and just all age. \nSPEAKER_13:  No, no it is not. I can assure you, unfortunately. So. \nSPEAKER_12:  I can assure you unfortunately \nSPEAKER_06:  fantastic. I appreciate you. \nSPEAKER_13:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Are you clap pork? Yeah, that's great. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  And I also point out that there's some really great security. \nSPEAKER_06:  at City Hall. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  considerations of things that happen. I just... \nSPEAKER_06:  It has security. It's got parking and my vote tonight. \nSPEAKER_06:  would be if we take about to go to move to City Hall. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, thank you. Luckily our meetings don't get too wild, but we'll go ahead and move over to Commissioner Gillette. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, thank you. Some of my questions were answered in that session just now. So thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I do, as with many people, favor the hybrid approach. I attended the Cultural Heritage Commission hearing. \nSPEAKER_00:  a week or two ago. \nSPEAKER_00:  and it was, I attended from home and \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  was I didn't have any issues here, but I'm understanding that the difficulty is being in chambers. So I'm glad to hear that that is something that is being rectified and hopefully soon. \nSPEAKER_00:  The other reason why I like doing it at City Hall is I know when we held the Philippine American History Month celebration and other cultural celebrations \nSPEAKER_00:  that usually happen at City Hall right before City Council meeting. And I think it exposes the community to an area that could be intimidating. \nSPEAKER_00:  So while I like that we go into the community, deep into the community, \nSPEAKER_00:  I think more importantly, it's important for us to offer that hybrid approach. So if we can't do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, going into the community. \nSPEAKER_00:  Having the community come to City Hall, take away that stigma or that intimidation of being. \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, among public officials. \nSPEAKER_00:  and exposing them to this, you know, the courtyard where many of the events take place, I think we will have more participation from the community. \nSPEAKER_00:  because they'll become familiar with City Hall if they're able to go there. But as we have been said here, there are times that people can't travel. And so, \nSPEAKER_00:  We already know that we do Zoom or virtual. \nSPEAKER_00:  from Seahaw and it's available at no fee so \nSPEAKER_00:  I like it. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Commissioner we're going to go to Commissioner Camacho then vice chair and then hopefully move to some type of resolution \nSPEAKER_10:  my comments have. \nSPEAKER_10:  David, you're second. Everyone said so. \nSPEAKER_11:  I didn't quite hear that. Can you? \nSPEAKER_10:  the last two commissioners have said everything I was going to say. \nSPEAKER_01:  I love that we're having such a good conversation about this. I think it's very important. I think equity looks different from different lenses. And so it's just very important to me. \nSPEAKER_01:  that one there's a bus line to get there, that there is options for people to get there. \nSPEAKER_01:  at a time that they can make it and and the zoom to me. \nSPEAKER_01:  Zoom is the easiest way when we talk about do we have the sound system to do a hybrid or the equipment to do a hybrid? We all have it now. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was on a Zoom until like 20 minutes before this meeting. So we can do that almost anywhere. So just making sure that everyone in our community feels confident and aware. I love the idea from Commissioner Gillette that bringing people to a place that is sometimes scary, I think to them or, but I think sometimes that fear or that intimidation drives them not to make that next step. So I think there's lots of options I think still on the table and I look forward to you guys deciding where you're going to go. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you, Vice Chair. So I do want to \nSPEAKER_11:  make a proposal. I want to make a motion that we \nSPEAKER_11:  So we have, well, first before I do that. \nSPEAKER_11:  Let me clarify, this is not available next month. We have to go somewhere else next month. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  That's correct. \nSPEAKER_11:  That's crazy. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay. So with that I would like to make a motion for us to default to the chambers to City Hall. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um, \nSPEAKER_11:  and continue looking at those two other options. It sounded like there was more research that was needed for Miller and PCC. \nSPEAKER_11:  and \nSPEAKER_11:  I think there was some conversation about potentially asking trustees for waivers and figuring out maybe some tech at Miller. \nSPEAKER_11:  and \nSPEAKER_11:  So \nSPEAKER_11:  the motion is to \nSPEAKER_11:  default to the chambers because it has that hybrid technology. Now it has all the things we need right now. Yes, there's some limitations. \nSPEAKER_11:  but that can be the default while we \nSPEAKER_11:  continue to figure out. \nSPEAKER_11:  this issue because it's clearly not resolved and it's not going to be entirely resolved tonight. So my motion is to default to City Hall until we can resolve it. \nSPEAKER_10:  point of order. Do we have to vote on the receiving file first before we? \nSPEAKER_01:  and the location doesn't have to get voted on because as it still has the chair you can put it there. Oh okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Oh, okay. I thought we were voting on the location. \nSPEAKER_01:  I thought we were going to be \nSPEAKER_01:  I want you to be patient, be patient, be patient. You're putting on received involved. Yeah. Okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah, okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  Oh, all right then. Well, then we already have. \nSPEAKER_10:  No, it's already been. \nSPEAKER_11:  So we already have a motion and a second on the floor then for the receiving file. Okay, so can we go ahead and get a vote? \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. Commissioner Awen? Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Bats. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Cometure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. Commissioner Capington. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner for Lotties? Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Gillette. Yes. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Lara? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, Commissioner Montgomery. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Schultz. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. Vice Chair Erickson. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Cher Guti\u00e9rrez. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, motion passes. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. Moving on to item number four. \nSPEAKER_11:  That's you, right, Alana? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_02:  Item number four is a recommendation to discuss the city manager's process to send equity and human relation commission recommendations to city council and if appropriate, take any necessary related actions regarding the same. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm not like Tony, y'all. I'm sitting down. \nSPEAKER_12:  I'm sitting there. \nSPEAKER_07:  I couldn't have done that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_12:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha \nSPEAKER_11:  It was better. I would. \nSPEAKER_12:  It was very, I was like... \nSPEAKER_04:  It was very, I was like... \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, well, good evening, Chair and members of the Commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  The item before you all. \nSPEAKER_07:  the information we will be providing tonight does come from both the handbook. \nSPEAKER_07:  the authorities, boards, commissions, and committees handbook, as well as the equity and human relations commission ordinance. I wanted to offer that as context as we walk through the \nSPEAKER_07:  commissions avenues for advocacy to the council. So a few components that this will cover will include commission functions, the advisory relationship and nature of \nSPEAKER_07:  a commission and the City Council, equity and human relations commission duties, and the means of coordinating with the City Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, so first up. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Commission functions. So each of the commissions perform at least one of the functions listed on the screen. What I'll just point out is that all commissions are seen as advisory to the City Council and on that note That that also includes a equity and human relations commission \nSPEAKER_07:  And that means that \nSPEAKER_07:  by advising the City Council. We do so concerning policies and programs upon request the City Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  and also provide some context on some of the other functions. Just brief descriptions of these other commission functions. One example of quasi judicial would be the planning commission and they're right to approve or deny permits. \nSPEAKER_07:  The Harbor Commission, their administrative function, they have the power to hire their own staff. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then as far as advisory to the City Council, the Citizens Police Complaint Commission, they make recommendations to the City Manager regarding the discipline of police officers. \nSPEAKER_07:  some more on the advisory function. \nSPEAKER_07:  The City Council relies on the various commissions to offer viewpoints that help solve city problems. So this means that Council may refer items to the Equity and Human Relations Commission for consideration. \nSPEAKER_07:  and a recommendation to the council. \nSPEAKER_07:  The commission may also make policy recommendations to council related to any policy matter With in its subject matter jurisdiction. So this might be \nSPEAKER_07:  informed by your duties and that can occur without request from council. So a couple of examples from our commission would be our involvement with surveillance technology as well as the commission's involvement with Lincoln Park \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, so. \nSPEAKER_07:  specific to the equity and human relations commission these next two slides come from our ordinance. What I want to point out is that this is not all of the equity and human relations commission duties. These are specifically the commission's duties that relate to your work with the City Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right? \nSPEAKER_07:  So building upon that advisory nature of the Equity and Human Relations Commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  We, you all, can submit advisory policy recommendations to City Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  regarding policies, systems, and programs. So that could be under the guise of promoting goodwill and better relationships, full acceptance among all people, fostering a more equitable and socially just long beach. It could be policies, programs, et cetera, related to and affecting human relations, social justice issues and equity. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then in the areas of research and education for the purpose of lessening racial religious or other prejudice and fostering attitudes among various groups which lead to civil peace. And then finally, \nSPEAKER_07:  policies which will promote understanding and cooperation between the various departments of city council, I mean of city and community members. \nSPEAKER_07:  and that could be programs related to human relations, trainings for city staff. \nSPEAKER_07:  additional duties. So equity and human relations commission is also expected to submit a report to the city council annually that details the status and progress on equity measures in the city. This is including but not limited to the objectives called out within the city's racial equity and reconciliation initiative. Additionally, the commission, uh, uh, \nSPEAKER_07:  when advising and making recommendations to council and other areas. \nSPEAKER_07:  The commission can do so as directed by council. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then again, as previously mentioned, the commission can also just take on topics of interest and relay those recommendations to the council. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then finally to submit an annual report of equity and human relations commissions activities for the past year. And this could also include some of those recommendations that you all have made as a governing body. \nSPEAKER_07:  So these next few slides consist of examples of what coordination with the city council may look like. On that note, I want to begin with uplifting memorandums. So due to the limited capacity of city council and their time, it is recommended that commissions send memorandums with their policy recommendations to the city council. Recommendations may look like letters or reports written and approved by the commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  and they are transmitted to the Mayor and City Council as memos sent by the City of Managers. So we put together the flow chart that you see on the screen. \nSPEAKER_07:  And so let's say a recommendation begins with the commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  It'll then be handed off to Tony, your commission liaison. \nSPEAKER_07:  and our department or office to \nSPEAKER_07:  put together a full memo. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then we passed that along to the City Manager for review. \nSPEAKER_07:  upon which they have discretion and how it is then submitted to the mayor and city council. One note about memorandums that's really important is that these are in addition to being circulated among the city council in mayor. They're also posted on the city manager's website which makes it \nSPEAKER_07:  publicly available to community and to the media. \nSPEAKER_07:  So there's a level of transparency with memorandums. \nSPEAKER_07:  Next up presentations. So the commission can also present to the City Council by requesting an item be placed on the City Council agenda. \nSPEAKER_07:  through their commission liaison. Again, recognizing that there is a limited time available in city council meetings, the placement of presentations on the council agenda cannot be guaranteed. And it's up to the discretion of the city manager. If approved, the city manager places the item on the council's agenda, add an appropriate time on behalf of the commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  Finally, advocacy. The commission's advocacy can occur after an equity and human relations commission recommendation is sent to council. \nSPEAKER_07:  The Chair and Vice Chair may discuss that recommendation with individual members and the mayor. \nSPEAKER_07:  The chair and vice chair also may lobby on behalf of the commission. If the commission wishes or prefers a different member of the commission advocate to the council and mayor, they are expected to vote and designate a person. \nSPEAKER_07:  Otherwise, only the chair of a commission or a member who has that prior approval should speak on behalf of the commission to the mayor or a council member. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioners can speak with council members and mayor in their private capacity as a resident of the city about an issue or adding an item to the council agenda. So again, you just need to make sure you \nSPEAKER_07:  distinguish whether or not you're doing so as a member of the body or doing so in your individual capacity. \nSPEAKER_07:  Finally, the equity and human relations commission must vote on. \nSPEAKER_07:  vote. \nSPEAKER_07:  and agree on a policy position for the chair or vice chair to advocate for a recommendation on behalf of the commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  So while this was previously mentioned, the commissions, and the commission's duties are just wanted to expound on the annual report. So commissions are required by the Long Beach Municipal Code to submit an annual report of its activities for the past year to the Marin City Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  And just a few of those components include the name of the body, your objectives and functions, a reference to all of the reports and recommendations that you've presented to the City Council, including some of the subject matters referred to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_07:  the number of meetings held within that year. \nSPEAKER_07:  as well as attendance records of all of the members. So this is definitely something that our staff or your commission liaison would support you with. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  some other components include the amount of money if any expensive in support of that body list of city personnel who regularly assist and recommendation as to whether the body should be abolished modified or continued. \nSPEAKER_07:  Finally. \nSPEAKER_07:  with attending City Council meetings or getting items on the agenda just a reminder that regular City Council meetings occur every Tuesday with the exception of the last Tuesday in the month. \nSPEAKER_07:  commissions are welcome to attend and participate in public comments periods. When commissioners address the council they should clarify whether they are speaking on their own behalf or on behalf of the commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  And that should be done at the beginning of your commentary. \nSPEAKER_07:  and then only the... \nSPEAKER_07:  the chair of the commission or a member who has the prior approval of the commission should speak on the behalf of the commission. \nSPEAKER_07:  Just a reminder that all of the information presented in this presentation comes from the handbook on commissions and other governing bodies, as well as the Equity and Human Relations Commission, ordinance. \nSPEAKER_07:  This concludes my presentation. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Ilana. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so if we have a motion in second to receive a file, I'll then go to public comment. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. I'll move to receive a file. This is great report. Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_05:  Christian or Allen seconds. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. Okay, before we get into discussion, let's go to public comment. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think the presentation was helpful, but we have brought up concerns before, since we participated within the process of the recommendations. \nSPEAKER_00:  on banning facial recognition and \nSPEAKER_00:  automated license plate readers, right? There was a \nSPEAKER_00:  intervention of the city manager's opinion within the memo. So I'm curious how \nSPEAKER_00:  This can be looked into since I don't see it as being part of the process for the recommendations. And I would also like to see some action steps for like \nSPEAKER_00:  like the action that was taking, or recommendations that are already, unfortunately, like, \nSPEAKER_00:  conversations that are controversial to bring up, but really \nSPEAKER_00:  There's been a lot of community members that spoke of Gensie's technologies, right? And so... \nSPEAKER_00:  Basically, what are the action steps that commissioners can make to make sure that when there is an inter, like there is a \nSPEAKER_00:  The city manager intervenes with the recommendations. What is the process that the equity human relations commissions can create if that were to happen again or to address it? In meetings with council members. \nSPEAKER_00:  I did share that this memo was shared out with the city manager's own recommendations and they were confused right and so I think \nSPEAKER_00:  There is a lot of awareness that need to be brought up around this. So I'm curious to know as commissioners how you can bring awareness and then also \nSPEAKER_00:  how we can not normalize the intervening of a memo that was issued at with a lot of community work that was hyperlinked and not necessarily sent as an actual memo. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Next speaker please. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I mean, I will say I think in the sort of flow that was presented, the part where the city manager has discretion is I think what we're talking about. And so if there's a sort of like acknowledgement that from this point forward, the city manager has discretion. I think there's something that the board can do to sort of address the discretion that is used and particularly allowed to how the recommendations were shared. I think there was inconsistencies with \nSPEAKER_02:  the recommendation specific to ALPR's automatic license plate readers and facial rec and how like research was attached how the recommendations themselves are hyperlinked versus attachments like I think all those little things speak to the discretion that the city manager has but then what does the commission get to do or can do within your purview and power. \nSPEAKER_02:  to sort of either one. \nSPEAKER_02:  Name that that happened because of the city manager's discretion. \nSPEAKER_02:  or two \nSPEAKER_02:  come back and revisit so that the city manager, because it sounds like it's not even council right at that point, the city manager is holding the power. And then council can then decide if you all go to them and be like, hey, actually, there's consistency here, then council can take it over. But unless anybody does that, city manager, the buck stops there, and the recommendations kind of go out to the public the way the city manager decides. And so what can sort of be done to address or circumvent or outright prevent intervention. And I think intervention here could look like various many things, taking the recommendations. \nSPEAKER_02:  adding your own, how you share those recommendations when you share them. I think all of that kind of is captured here. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. Next speaker please. \nSPEAKER_06:  Good evening, everyone. Thank you so much, Ilana, for that presentation. It was really helpful to visualize and to see where the current parameters lie, which also just elevate our concerns for the violations that have occurred in the previous process regarding the anti-surveillance recommendations that you all made and your recommendation letter. And so I think for me, one of the things that's been on my mind is where are we in this process, right? In terms of holding the city manager accountable for the various violations regarding this, your recommendations and then his recommendations moving forward. And so for me, that interference is in regards to, not only speaking against the recommendations, which we all heard, right, is pretty uncommon. \nSPEAKER_06:  or unheard of in the last at least 10 years. But also the delay and violation of the timeline that he was given to make those recommendations to City Council. And then on top of that, the overall strategic timing of the release of the memo, which contained a link, which was another violation, right? So adding language is that a possibility, right? Of adding language that the city manager would be required. \nSPEAKER_06:  to include the full body of language on tampered. \nSPEAKER_06:  in his recommendations, not just a hyperlink to make sure that that's a given. What are the accountability pieces to ensure that those recommendations are given in a timely manner, not only within the timeframe, but also not on the very last day or the very last week before council goes on recess, before the holiday break. And so those are some of my key concerns in terms of accountability in regards to process. I also wanna take this opportunity to encourage and push since those recommendations have now been made for you all as commissioners to really embrace your power and make sure that you all do select that person if you haven't done so yet to really advocate, right? And also to do it on your own personal capacity worked so hard to come to. So I know there's several more that are coming to mind, but I wanna be respectful of our time. But if there's any way that we can update, whether that, I don't know if that would come down to city charter updates to make sure that those things happen, but I think just being really mindful of how do we qualify and how do we systematize these changes to make sure that not only your recommendations, but recommendations of other commissions are respected. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, seeing no other members of the public, closing out public comment. I do want to make a few comments first. I see there's quite a few queued up, but I'm going to take my privileges chair. \nSPEAKER_10:  So I have a question in particular about the advocacy slide. I just want to highlight that. Well, first let me ask. \nSPEAKER_10:  Is this a policy? \nSPEAKER_10:  Where does this policy lie? Is this the policy that governs all? \nSPEAKER_10:  commissions or trying to get a better understanding of this because this is not the way that we've operated. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, the advocacy slide actually comes directly from the handbook. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  and this is applicable to our commissions. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, and so are we able to, as we're creating bylaws, are we able to, \nSPEAKER_10:  tweak what this looks like for our commission or if changes need to be made to this does that go with that have to go to like the city council \nSPEAKER_11:  So if you want a different person than the chair to advocate, you can designate a person. \nSPEAKER_11:  I think we would need to talk through it during the by-laws conversation about what that looks like for you. \nSPEAKER_11:  whether or not all of the commissioners can go and advocate. Sometimes it's better to have one voice. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_11:  So it would depend on what you're thinking. Usually the way that commissions manage this is you'll have a particular item. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  And certain commissioners are very passionate about whatever that item is. And those are the commissioners that get sent forth if it's not the chair to discuss it with council, because they have usually the information. They're passionate about it, right? And those things transcend when you're talking to other people. \nSPEAKER_00:  is \nSPEAKER_11:  So you could do it on a case by case basis if you want to do something similar. \nSPEAKER_11:  I can look at some other models of like what is possible. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, so we don't we need to necessarily change the sun. It's just what our commission votes on each time. So the way that we \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  Historically operated is once our commission passes the recommendations then that gives us all the authority to go and Speak on these recommendations on behalf of the commission because the commission has voted \nSPEAKER_10:  for those recommendations. \nSPEAKER_11:  So that if that's what you like to do, you could do that. Yeah. And then, and we could codify it in the bylaws that you all have the ability. \nSPEAKER_10:  and then... \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  two \nSPEAKER_11:  advocate for whatever policies you pass. It just, you can't advocate for things that you haven't all agreed of course. Of course. By vote. Right. \nSPEAKER_10:  Right. \nSPEAKER_11:  I mean, the only things that we've passed as a mission. So that's definitely an option. If that's something that you guys want to do, and that's a great thing to put in the by-laws. OK, right? \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, that's a good question. \nSPEAKER_10:  perfect. And then the other, yeah, the other thing that we've historically done is \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  because there are nine of us that are appointed by the council, like by seat, right? The council district seat. \nSPEAKER_10:  It's the way we've operated is that the that person becomes responsible for communicating with their council member \nSPEAKER_10:  about the recommendations that we've passed. And in the past, it'll often be the vice chair or chair will usually attend meetings with them more so because they want that support. But not exclusively, I think at one point we're doing some round of recommendations, even I think for our ordinance amendment. \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner coming to met with his council member on his own and things like that so \nSPEAKER_10:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_10:  Just, there's been, we've already been operating a certain way, so I want to just make sure that we're able to, and I think that's been working, and we've all feel empowered to do that, so I want to make sure we're able to continue that in some way. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I do want to make sure \nSPEAKER_11:  what I want you guys to do so that we don't \nSPEAKER_11:  We're running out of time, but also like focusing what this item is on. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_11:  on. \nSPEAKER_11:  I want you all in the next month to think about the things that you've been doing in practice that I maybe wouldn't have known. \nSPEAKER_11:  because I have only been here for a short period of time that are normal to you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Like your meetings are two and a half hours long. That's not usually what commissions do little things like that and Collect them and share them with me so that I can make sure to codify what it is that you're doing in the case. Okay. Thank you \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, moving on to ice chair. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, sure. Thank you so much, Alana, those are wonderful reports. I too have questions. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I have noticed that other commissions use annual reports as an opportunity to get a presentation in front of the council. Is that something that this team can advocate for on a yearly basis? \nSPEAKER_09:  Oh, you don't get to, you don't get to. \nSPEAKER_07:  hidden the wrong button there. \nSPEAKER_07:  Absolutely, we can put forth that request. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay, because I think that just means there's one time a month a year that we really get to be in front of them. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm going to take just a second because you shared that the city manager could \nSPEAKER_09:  And I'm sorry, I didn't write down the word you used. It was a good one. Can change or how that our recommendation goes to the council based on his purview? That is not in this document. Is that somewhere else? \nSPEAKER_07:  That is... \nSPEAKER_07:  We're all looking. I'm looking at my city attorney here. \nSPEAKER_12:  You brought America here. \nSPEAKER_11:  So I'll be the bad guy. \nSPEAKER_12:  and \nSPEAKER_11:  professional web blanket. So city manager as city manager always has \nSPEAKER_12:  always have. \nSPEAKER_09:  everyone. \nSPEAKER_11:  Not whatever he wants, but he always has the discretion to make a recommendation to council. Sure. So, one of the things that you could ask of him, and it would be a request of him that he could. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. \nSPEAKER_11:  except we're not. \nSPEAKER_11:  is that your recommendations are sent separate from his recommendations, right? That would be the request. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I'm not trying to put anybody on spot here, what I'm saying is we've been having some questions for six years. Kelly will tell you all day that this is the work we did for the first two years of my chairmanship, was how do we bring a request timely? \nSPEAKER_09:  to the council, right? And Kelly also felt that same way. And back then, I remember a day when \nSPEAKER_09:  We \nSPEAKER_09:  and pass something at commission one night and the next Tuesday. \nSPEAKER_09:  brought it to the council as a \nSPEAKER_09:  like public comment, right? And we didn't tell Kelly, we didn't tell anybody we should have done all of those things, but we just didn't have time, right? \nSPEAKER_09:  And in the end, I think it was okay, but she got a look from the then city manager because he didn't know and I understand that want to understand what's happening. But I think the timeliness piece is a hard one because as you know, we're talking about things that the public is bringing us and we're going a month later. \nSPEAKER_09:  It's maybe over or it's changed again or it's more. So that is very good to know if that could be something that we request. That's at least a great piece. And then to be able to, if we don't get a meeting for it, be able to go and speak it into public comment, at least. That has always been our tool as a recommender, as a council, as a commission. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I hope this body does that more often. \nSPEAKER_09:  That worried me when I saw that come. \nSPEAKER_09:  when you said that they may not give a recommendation. That's fine, but if it's, yeah. \nSPEAKER_11:  It's for the presentation. It's specifically for presentations. That's why memos are recommended. So the memo, the memo we guarantee, the memo will get there. Right. And then the other thing is, is that the public and the press are all trained to go to that mayor and, memos to the mayor and city council website. That's where the T of the city is. Right. That's where the happenings are going on. That's where all the stuff is. Not T, sorry. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  We know. \nSPEAKER_11:  It's been a long day. But yeah, legal term. But that's where things are happening. That's where information is being transmitted to them. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  A recommendation memo that we write has to go there is what you're saying. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah, if it's sent to the city manager, so my concern is doing something different than that. \nSPEAKER_11:  We risk losing that transparency, which is very valuable, right? So as part of your recommendation, you can consider doing things like asking the city manager to send it within a certain amount of time. \nSPEAKER_11:  You're beautiful, wonderful staff. It's in this room today is part of the machine that makes that happen. For sure. I just, if you guys are going to put that kind of \nSPEAKER_12:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Restriction parameter on your recommendation. I would ask that you put a reasonable one. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  back in helping her get to this as she says it goes well. i really\uadc0 \nSPEAKER_11:  to give them the time to do it right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_09:  to do it right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Right. So 30 days something reasonable not like it needs to go by Friday and we just wrapped it up on Wednesday. Right. That's not practical. Speed of government unfortunately. So if you could give staff that space to have it move through the chain to put things in perspective to you items that go to the city council start. \nSPEAKER_11:  through the chain of command, I believe it's two to three months. Yes. It's an average of two to three months. So everything that you see on council yesterday, we were working on two to three months ago. So and probably, \nSPEAKER_11:  earlier than that. The council letter started through the process, not the project. So... \nSPEAKER_11:  as a perspective of how long those types of things take. \nSPEAKER_09:  And thank you for sharing that. I think that's important for the whole commission to understand that. My last question, and I'm looking at the chairs and vice chairs on this one. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  but also the last one just to \nSPEAKER_09:  you can ask for these things and you just have to ask nicely and usually those things happen. So I think the last piece is just echoing what Cherkuthiara says, which is \nSPEAKER_09:  Everyone in this room has the agency. \nSPEAKER_09:  The minute we passed something in this room to say this got passed at the \nSPEAKER_09:  A E H R C. End of story. \nSPEAKER_09:  I mean, you guys as staff don't go to council very often, but you could even say it or the community could say it. \nSPEAKER_09:  I just want to make sure that in your new bylaws as you're growing. \nSPEAKER_09:  that you make sure that every person on this commission has agency. \nSPEAKER_09:  to go to their, we're defined by the nine council districts so they can go to the council people and get to know them. \nSPEAKER_09:  get to know their constituents. So I hope that that will keep moving forward because that's a really important piece of what commissions can do. So yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, thank you, Vice Chair. And before I call on Commissioner Camacho, I just... \nSPEAKER_10:  I think that we're having this conversation. I'm not sure that we can actually just request things of the city manager because we're in this conversation because \nSPEAKER_10:  there was different. \nSPEAKER_10:  you know, levels of interference and things that the city manager used his discretion for. And so if there's things that we're asking for on recommendations that he doesn't agree with, then \nSPEAKER_10:  like \nSPEAKER_10:  There has to be some other method of accountability or avenue to get our \nSPEAKER_10:  recommendations and the things we need to city council and because like we can't ask the person who is like causing this whole issue and conversation. So I just that part I'm a little bit confused about but I will move on to Commissioner C'mon. \nSPEAKER_07:  wait for that that's not \nSPEAKER_07:  If I may. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  having those requests such as a time certain by when you want. \nSPEAKER_07:  that memo sent to council as well as the requests for their you know no attachment of a staff report. I believe that we would put it on record. \nSPEAKER_12:  Mm hmm. \nSPEAKER_07:  and that would be included in the letter that we use. \nSPEAKER_07:  Compile before we even attach your letter. \nSPEAKER_07:  So we have it written that that was the request of the commission. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, I hear what you're saying. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. Commissioner Camacho. \nSPEAKER_04:  That was my question because I was looking at the flow chart about the memo. So \nSPEAKER_04:  When we write. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm Emma. \nSPEAKER_04:  the staff memo, the in theory both go on the public website. \nSPEAKER_04:  Regardless of if there's an additional staff report from the City Manager's Office, correct? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know this is a Vulture, but there's not a feedback loop correct, so we don't know until after... \nSPEAKER_04:  a commission would not know if there's going to be a city manager's report. Like it's up to their discretion. So. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's no way \nSPEAKER_04:  hypothetically to know in the future if there was. \nSPEAKER_11:  So once a commission votes on it, yes. So once a commission votes on it, and sends it through the pathway, there would be no report back to you, or not automatically, unless you requested it, that something has changed. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So it could be a request like if there is a staff memo or is the same. \nSPEAKER_11:  If for some reason you want to report back. \nSPEAKER_11:  that city managers are going to send their recommendation at the same time. You can ask, like Amy said, you can ask, sorry. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Commissioner Amy. \nSPEAKER_11:  \uc544! \nSPEAKER_11:  I've known you too long. \nSPEAKER_11:  you can always ask. \nSPEAKER_11:  for these things. \nSPEAKER_11:  It doesn't mean that it's always going to happen, but at least you can request it and set your \nSPEAKER_11:  what your expectation is for your guys' recommendations and what you want to have happen and put it out there of like, this is how we want our recommendations handled. \nSPEAKER_11:  Because by saying nothing, it's automatically just going to flow through the process as it is. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, mainly my question. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I think that's a good future project for us to come up with. \nSPEAKER_04:  standard recommendations we give for things moving forward. \nSPEAKER_04:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you, Commissioner Camacho, on to Dr. Lara. \nSPEAKER_03:  Actually, Commissioner Camacho asked my questions, so I appreciate it, and I will see you my time. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. Question, Nicholson. \nSPEAKER_10:  Am I on? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  There was a long list. \nSPEAKER_12:  There was a lot. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  This has been a lesson for you in city process that you've been \nSPEAKER_01:  doing for a long time. \nSPEAKER_01:  for a worthy cause. \nSPEAKER_01:  that everybody here \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe most people here \nSPEAKER_01:  I read an agreement with you. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then you watch that agreement have an obstacle. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have experience in this. \nSPEAKER_01:  twice the city council voted against. \nSPEAKER_01:  Something I felt very, very strongly about took two years for it to go out and come back. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then we took it to the people. \nSPEAKER_01:  Libre. \nSPEAKER_01:  The people, we took it to the people. \nSPEAKER_01:  We collected signatures and got it on the ballot. \nSPEAKER_01:  and 78% of the people voted in favor of it. So when you see an obstacle, \nSPEAKER_01:  I want to encourage you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Two. \nSPEAKER_01:  Look in the history of how such an obstacle was disassembled. \nSPEAKER_01:  And, you know, the good news is... \nSPEAKER_01:  It's always the people. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Alright, come on, show your talent. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. So I guess, and I'm trying to, I think you've answered a lot of my questions as well. So if we ask, and I mean, I know inside the city it's called the TFF, right, the memos that go out. So if we ask for it to be in that specific format, it moves through the process unaltered. \nSPEAKER_05:  by anybody at the city in city management or there is still a process for it to be altered or to \nSPEAKER_05:  add on to it in addition to what we've done. \nSPEAKER_07:  So your recommendations themselves will not be altered. The discretion as far as whether a staff report is attached to that is again, got it up to the city manager. \nSPEAKER_05:  on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so I think for me where I'm trying to root, like, the balancing act here is actually in... \nSPEAKER_05:  I forgot what slide it was, but the equity and human relations commission duties, right, those first two bullets to promote goodwill, better relations and full acceptance among all people in the community and to foster more equitable and socially just long beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's our charge. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so I think that's... \nSPEAKER_05:  I mean, again, we're going to have to set. That's clearly what this commission is built to do and to create and to ensure that alternative voices are heard. And so. \nSPEAKER_05:  I guess how do we... \nSPEAKER_05:  I guess is there a way for us to increase that transparency within this process? I know we said the city manager has full discretion as a city manager, but is that a charter change, is that a municipal code change? \nSPEAKER_05:  What does that look like? Because there's gotta be some. \nSPEAKER_05:  factor like way to navigate this process like it's not just \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, that would throw our hands in the air kind of scenario. So I'm just curious is there. \nSPEAKER_05:  things that we can advocate for, that increase, that transparency around those dissenting voices, which will more than likely come from our commission more than once. \nSPEAKER_11:  So there's a chapter in the municipal code that regulates all advisory commissions, not charter commissions in the city. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  charter commissions would require a charter amendment. \nSPEAKER_11:  But your commission is regulated by chapter 2.18 in addition to 2.44 I think. So \nSPEAKER_11:  I think that's something that you could advocate to City Council to amend that section. Or if that chapter would probably go to me. \nSPEAKER_11:  to do it. That recommendations sent to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_11:  would be sent basically unaltered. \nSPEAKER_12:  mm-hmm \nSPEAKER_11:  That is a change that you could advocate for. \nSPEAKER_11:  It would require City Council to \nSPEAKER_11:  agenda is it? It's unlikely that the staff in this room will agenda is it? City manager is there boss? But someone from the council could agenda is it on \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, ma'am. \nSPEAKER_11:  your behalf that goes back to advocacy. \nSPEAKER_11:  Request an ordinance from my office and then we work to do the change and then it would take \nSPEAKER_11:  takes two readings, so usually two council meetings, and then once the mayor signs it, it's another 31 days. So it would be \nSPEAKER_11:  long process to get the change, but it would be \nSPEAKER_11:  It's harder to change the moonicote. It takes a long time, usually, to make those changes. But that would be an option for you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, to make those changes. \nSPEAKER_05:  got it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, no, I appreciate that. \nSPEAKER_11:  That would be the most permanent option. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  I appreciate that. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  So I think that is all the comments and I appreciate that I, that was going to be one of my final questions was, is how do we \nSPEAKER_10:  make the systemic change in the process that doesn't put the onus back on us to have to continue to ask for the things that we need every single time. If we know that these are the things that \nSPEAKER_10:  We need these are things that create an equitable process. \nSPEAKER_10:  then we need to go to that route. And that is our work. That is our purview as Equity Human Relations Commission is to institutionalize equity. \nSPEAKER_10:  And so in this case, institutionalizing equity would be to amend the \nSPEAKER_10:  ordinance that is creating these barriers for us to \nSPEAKER_10:  truly uplift the voices of communities most. \nSPEAKER_10:  impacted by inequity and injustice in the city. \nSPEAKER_10:  And so I think this is just a really... \nSPEAKER_10:  good example, it's not a sexy campaign, but this is the work of \nSPEAKER_00:  Right? \nSPEAKER_10:  just removing those barriers and just chipping away where we need to. \nSPEAKER_10:  to be able to actually \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  have. \nSPEAKER_11:  our voices heard. \nSPEAKER_11:  So in the meantime, if that's the route that this commission decides, you can send one letter to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_11:  You can put in the motion. \nSPEAKER_11:  that \nSPEAKER_11:  every time you send the \nSPEAKER_11:  a recommendation that staff reattaches your letter. \nSPEAKER_11:  Right? So you don't have to keep making the same recommendation and remembering to do a motion. You can do one letter. Ask for it now from the city manager in the hopes that the policy will change in the way that you're asking for it to be changed. And then staff when your recommendations are transmitted will have direction from you to attach your ask of city manager until it changes. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, that's an option. That way you're not having to like, don't forget guys. Right. \nSPEAKER_10:  We got to ask for all these things. And so that's like a short-term potential kind of fix while we're making some more systemic change. \nSPEAKER_11:  and so \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Can that go in the bylaws? \nSPEAKER_10:  That kind of request maybe we can... \nSPEAKER_12:  class maybe we can. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. All right. Commissioner Coveington. \nSPEAKER_13:  Number 30, okay, thank you. So I really appreciate the presentation today. Thank you so much, staff, for providing us this fruitful conversation. I love all of the ideas that we're bringing for it. One thing that comes to mind is \nSPEAKER_13:  I guess I want to remind us that even if we do all of those things, we still need to be on top of going to City Council and reminding them of what we're adding to the meetings. Because as much faith that we have in our staff, in the system, in the structures, there's always human error. \nSPEAKER_13:  And so it's important that as we're entertaining and going to possibly recommend some of these steps moving forward that we also continue to show up to City Council for our specific agenda items and also read off our letters and our recommendations and say I know you have it but we're gonna read it to you anyways so that it sticks in their mind and then they know that we're gonna continue to be a president at City Council \nSPEAKER_13:  So thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so I'm just trying to gather what we're doing here. So, \nSPEAKER_10:  Um \nSPEAKER_10:  We have not there's not a motion on the floor at this time to me. \nSPEAKER_10:  That change how we would need a motion on the floor, is that right? \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  I know we need to receive them file. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  That's so you can withdraw the receiving file motion and then whoever I think we commissioner all in the motion. \nSPEAKER_10:  Oh, you did make a much. \nSPEAKER_10:  Oh, to receive a file. Yes. \nSPEAKER_11:  Oh, \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah, so withdraw that motion and then make the motion. \nSPEAKER_11:  of whatever, if it's more than just \nSPEAKER_11:  concluding the discussion. \nSPEAKER_11:  Someone only need to make a motion of what action the commission is going to take. \nSPEAKER_11:  and if you're going to make a recommendation and you don't have to do that today. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. Can we do that on next meeting? \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, so let me clarify. We can, the kind of temporary suggestion that you had, and I'm not going to repeat the whole thing. \nSPEAKER_10:  that talks about the requests that we can make and attach to each recommendation. That we can have that discussion in the context of our bylaws. Next meeting. \nSPEAKER_10:  And we also, if this commission agrees, we also want to make some type of \nSPEAKER_10:  It's permanent, systemic change to the ordinance that is, yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  to 2.1a. \nSPEAKER_11:  So the thing that would go in the bylaws is if you adopt today. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  that you are making a request of the city manager and it has time constraint. \nSPEAKER_11:  and that you're \nSPEAKER_11:  It doesn't get altered, whatever the other parameters are. \nSPEAKER_11:  Once you make that recommendation, you can add to it that staff would automatically attach it to any recommendation that you send. \nSPEAKER_00:  you've sent. \nSPEAKER_11:  to the city council and that we can put in your bylaws. But you have to decide what it is that your ask is first. \nSPEAKER_11:  And if you don't have to send one letter, we can also do it so that we can put it in your bylaws that when staff transmits your recommendations that those things are included. \nSPEAKER_11:  Um \nSPEAKER_11:  in the cover letter that goes to the city manager instead. That's an option. So you don't have to send something right now without a recommendation. You can wait until you have a recommendation, right? It's more timely. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  more \nSPEAKER_10:  So, Commissioner Allen, did you have, and I apologize, I had to first. Did you have a motion about this in particular about the unaltered? Okay, okay, I was just- Yes, a motion to receive- Got it. Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, okay. I was just going to receive a got it. Okay. So I need to withdraw that, right? Okay, so I will draw the motion to just receive a file. So let it form in. So. \nSPEAKER_10:  Right. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  So just to clarify, the first was Erickson and the second was Alan. Oh, I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_09:  It was me. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's all I hear. \nSPEAKER_09:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_09:  So. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm just going to ask very clearly, do we want to change this motion or we just want to receive and file this tonight and at next meeting you guys make sure that these pieces are in the conversation about the bylaws. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  I don't know how to go before I take this away. \nSPEAKER_10:  before it compacts the \nSPEAKER_10:  So that's gonna happen. \nSPEAKER_10:  That's already going to happen, but we need to ask for that right now. I think that's what I'm not following. \nSPEAKER_11:  I think you guys should agree on what you want to do. Okay. Right, so. \nSPEAKER_11:  If... \nSPEAKER_11:  Someone should make a motion. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  of what your intent is. So if your intent is, we're going to receive and file the presentation and then you're going to \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  options. \nSPEAKER_11:  include a provision in the bylaws at the \nSPEAKER_11:  of how you want staff to manage your recommendations. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yeah. You can do that at the next meeting and then you all vote on it. And if you don't agree on that, we can figure out something else. \nSPEAKER_09:  Can that work? \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm Commissioner Lara, almost Jared Lara. \nSPEAKER_03:  So one question though, because I like this idea. \nSPEAKER_03:  Right? \nSPEAKER_03:  Is there a mechanism in place between now and the next meeting to receive this suggested motion? \nSPEAKER_03:  and implications so that commissioners can fully wrap our minds around this in advance of that meeting. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, so what the motion can be this evening is one. \nSPEAKER_11:  to receive and file the discussion. \nSPEAKER_11:  or you don't even have to receive any further discussion. \nSPEAKER_11:  You could just make a motion that... \nSPEAKER_11:  in your bylaws. \nSPEAKER_11:  you're going to include that staff. \nSPEAKER_11:  transmits to the city manager that \nSPEAKER_11:  your recommendations are transmitted to Council unaltered. \nSPEAKER_11:  and that the recommendations are sent to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_11:  within 30 days of \nSPEAKER_11:  the date they \nSPEAKER_11:  of the meeting that you... \nSPEAKER_11:  made the recommendation. \nSPEAKER_11:  Right? \nSPEAKER_11:  You don't have to take those exact. \nSPEAKER_11:  Words but like you get the gist of what I'm saying right so you can set those parameters now Before we leave tonight and vote on them. Okay \nSPEAKER_12:  Okay, so this is the question. \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's the question. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  This is Vice Chair, and I will withdraw my first motion to receive a file. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  And then I want to then make the motion that asks staff to transmit our recommendations unaltered. \nSPEAKER_10:  and within 30 days. \nSPEAKER_10:  And if there's other things we want to add to that, we can do that in the bylaws discussion next meeting. But as of right now, my motion is to make sure our recommendations are transmitted unaltered and within 30 minutes. \nSPEAKER_09:  days. It's there a second. So this is a vice chair Eric's and I will second that with the friendly addition that the commission will work. \nSPEAKER_09:  towards making this true for all commissioners, all commissions in section 2.18. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, of the charter. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, I don't know we could add that today. We're adding things. I'm going to add them. Absolutely. \nSPEAKER_09:  about me. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  I like this version. She's very on tables today. \nSPEAKER_09:  I mean, you said. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  table today. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_04:  to include just a part of the motion to just receive a file also or do we? \nSPEAKER_10:  We don't need to. \nSPEAKER_04:  We don't need to proceed with our own. Okay. That's why it's a point of information. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  and then also if there are... \nSPEAKER_10:  Additional parameters. I imagine when we get to looking at 2.1 8 there may be other things that come up that we want to add to that we can add At a later time \nSPEAKER_09:  Adelaide or type. Just putting it in the record for today. \nSPEAKER_10:  Got it. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  So we have a motion in a second. I accept you friendly. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, any final discussion? \nSPEAKER_00:  any. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_10:  and \nSPEAKER_10:  Do we need to go to the public comment again? \nSPEAKER_10:  I did public comment on the receiving file but not on this motion. Does that have to happen? \nSPEAKER_09:  I mean, she's still here. Let's go. Let's go. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Any members of the public that I would like to speak to this session. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  to this mission. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_12:  Well, the only thing I wanted to say was, yeah, it's really... \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  We want you on the record. That way the record, yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. The only thing I regretted not saying earlier was the request to have these things agendized in the city council meetings and then also to request if city staff of Alana you could do your presentation to council members so that they also understand the roles of commissioners so that you all will hopefully receive less pushback. \nSPEAKER_06:  So those were the only things I wanted to put out there. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  I think those are some great parameters that we can think about as we're amending 2.1A as well just things to add. I think for tonight, yeah, I stand by my motion and accept it friendly. \nSPEAKER_10:  Okay, so can we please get a roll call vote? \nSPEAKER_10:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner Allen. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner Bax?

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_01:  next agenda item for us, item six, and we table till now jump into six. \nSPEAKER_02:  Recommendation to receive and file a report from current ad hoc committees. Discuss anticipated ad hoc committees for upcoming projects. And if appropriate, take action to dissolve or create ad hoc committees. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now for context purposes, this is one of the agenda items that was rolled over from I want to say the meaning back in \nSPEAKER_01:  June that it will get to so it was tabled over to this meeting and for additional context I am going to ask Commissioner Gutiales to share reporting of the ad hoc meeting where we're at and then go into discussion \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you chair. So just a really quick report. We after the last meeting, we decided actually we, actually after our meeting in May, we decided that we were going to ask the Office of Equity to put together what they put together today. So that was part of last month's report. So I didn't need to share that last month. So and then we decided that after today, after being able to narrow down to those priorities using the sticker dot voting, that our task was complete. And so we would be recommending to dissolve the roadmap ad hoc committee. I realized I just raised some questions in the last item around. Do we need further clarification or \nSPEAKER_04:  input on some of these priorities. \nSPEAKER_04:  We may, but I don't necessarily think that we need to do that as an ad hoc. That could be something that the entire committee commission can discuss. Maybe at one more meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  So that would be my recommendation. I don't know if I have to make a motion for that, but we're recommending the ad hoc committee is recommending to be dissolved. So that's the first part of the update. The other part of the update is we were going to ask Deputy City Attorney to share some considerations around an ad hoc committee kind of system in general. Should we do those two things separate? Because I'm reading the agenda item and there's several components to it. \nSPEAKER_03:  So when you decide to vote, \nSPEAKER_03:  Part of that vote would be to dissolve the road map and Hawk Committee. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then... \nSPEAKER_03:  I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll put a pin in that idea, right? While we discuss, or you discuss, \nSPEAKER_03:  whether or not in this space you're creating ad hoc to move forward or if you need to have an additional discussion about what you know. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're right in the sense that \nSPEAKER_03:  the priorities that you've chosen are very large priorities. So nearing the scope of that, maybe with an agenda item at the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  for a full discussion of the commission. As far as the ad hoc structure goes, I recommend that you guys continue to keep an item with language similar to this on your agenda if you're gonna operate with the ad hoc structure to keep track of all of them. \nSPEAKER_03:  You have a lot of work that you're trying to do. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um, so... \nSPEAKER_03:  allowing a space for the ad hawks in one item to do a quick report on what they're working on and the progress of \nSPEAKER_03:  the work that they're doing. I think is incredibly important to keep track of. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  I \nSPEAKER_03:  If an ad hoc feels that they need a full discussion of the commission. \nSPEAKER_03:  It should be a separate agenda item. \nSPEAKER_03:  right to give space for that. This is a general update of, hey, I think we have a couple more meetings to go. Or, oh, we're nowhere close. \nSPEAKER_03:  We still have a lot of work to do. We're finding the middle. You know, it's a space to allow communication, but not necessarily discussion on policies. Once the committees, once the ad hoc are ready to come back. \nSPEAKER_03:  It's an agenda item. It's a full discussion of the commission. It's hopefully a report from the ad hoc. \nSPEAKER_03:  with a recommendation on where this body should go. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  And then like I said before, I strongly recommend that you limit \nSPEAKER_03:  participation to one ad hoc at a time. You have a larger body, so you do have some discretion on how big your ad hoc can be. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  I, in my experience, I've seen usually about three members tend to be incredibly productive. Depending on what the type of work is, you can do more than that because COREM I think is eight. \nSPEAKER_03:  but thinking about the type of work that you want to accomplish. So we come back to the next meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  thinking about what that work looks like, how you as a body wanna break the work. \nSPEAKER_03:  into smaller digestible pieces so that things can get done. And what those ad hoc's would look like. Are you going to take the top two priorities and work on them at the same time? Are you going to break the number one priority into multiple smaller pieces? And different ad hoc's are working on those pieces and you come together as a body to create one giant picture. I think you have a lot of options. I think another discussion about \nSPEAKER_03:  taking up the first priority and how you guys want to work on that as a body. \nSPEAKER_03:  is something that you \nSPEAKER_03:  I recommend that you consider. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Does that clarify? Yes. Add Hone is a lot of information. Very, very, very helpful. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, that's what I was looking for. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, and then I want to, and I see, I'm coming to share a vice chair coming to As requesting to speak I want to share one more update. Oh, okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh yeah, that's weird. Okay, so I want to share one more update. Also just reminding the group that we in May voted to establish the recidivism ad hoc committee, but we put on hold appointing members to that ad hoc committee which I \nSPEAKER_04:  recognize that that's not a practice that we want to get in the habit of right when we establish at hot committees we want to \nSPEAKER_04:  identify the members of that ad hoc committee then and there. \nSPEAKER_04:  So just wanted to put that on our radar as well that that's a ad hoc committee that needs to be filled. So with that my motion is to dissolve the roadmap ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  It's also to keep the standing item on the agenda at our future meetings, the standing item around ad hoc where they can give quick reports on progress. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then the third would be to \nSPEAKER_04:  put in place that recidivism at heart. \nSPEAKER_04:  Or is that not to be in the motion? \nSPEAKER_03:  So the \nSPEAKER_03:  You can put that in the motion. The only thing that I would ask this body is, where does recidivism fit in the priorities that you just adopted in the prior item? And whether or not you need to have a larger discussion. If you're ready to create that ad hoc, \nSPEAKER_03:  and whether or not \nSPEAKER_03:  um, positivism can be \nSPEAKER_03:  couched under one of your other priorities or not. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, thank you for that clarification. And we did call out when we had that item in May. We did identify where it is a part of the racial equity reconciliation. And so we did \nSPEAKER_04:  I don't have it in front of me but in our May agenda it calls out what \nSPEAKER_04:  under which goal and strategy or strategy and goal, it is couched under. So do you want to make sure everyone's aware of that? Okay, then I'd like to, okay, scratch that motion. I think it would be best for us, at least for the ad hoc committee or for this item. I'd recommend then disolving the ad hoc and then keeping the standing agenda item. And then I would actually defer to the chair, vice chair, about how to move forward as far as how we narrow down the scope and whether the recidivism ad hoc is appropriate at this time or if that's something we decide at the next meeting. So then mine's just the two. Disolven and keep the standing item. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Clark, do you? \nSPEAKER_03:  Do you need that repeated back? Are you okay? \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm okay, I'm gonna capture it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, so since you meet a formal motion, commissioners, the others, I'm going to call for a second. And then we'll go through discussion. Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_01:  Richard \nSPEAKER_01:  Butler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Did I get that? So... \nSPEAKER_03:  So, all right. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Gutierrez. \nSPEAKER_03:  Madam Chair, can you clear it? Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can you? \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay sure good here is can you cue on your thank you \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Butler, now, Trey. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, so I have Commissioner Jellett or Commissioner Butler. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to be sure about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Second. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we have a second. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, I'm gonna ask Madam Clark to call for public comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  Seeing no members of the public in person, so none in person, and then if there are any members of the public in the zoom That would like to speak on item number six. Please use the raise hand feature now or dial star nine if calling in \nSPEAKER_02:  seeing none. \nSPEAKER_01:  The only comment that I'll offer now is \nSPEAKER_01:  much of what Commissioner Gutierrez articulated, I was actually thinking in terms of the racial conciliation framework, jump.me as a connection. I don't know the language in and out the London entire document, but I will memorize specifically, but I'm confident in not only your comments, but considering the framing of the document that this would have all under that. So I think this would be a space. And should the discussion go in this direction and if there's interest today, I don't think I don't think I \nSPEAKER_01:  we necessarily \nSPEAKER_01:  Should have to wait if there's interest already amongst three if there's already three people interested in that We could do that as a second perhaps a motion just as a thought So I'll leave it at that for now and see where the discussion leads us fellow commissioners. Chris here. I've got him done \nSPEAKER_00:  in regards to the recidivism at Hawk Committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  me or can you not hear me or chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. In regards to the recidivism at Hawk Committee, I know that we had two commissioners who were interested in leading that. It was Commissioner Allen and former vice chair Erickson. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think \nSPEAKER_00:  What I would want to recommend is that we hold off on the discussions of the adhocs for \nSPEAKER_00:  until September when everybody is here and we're regularly scheduled that way we can get a sense of who's interested in what and which ones we want to move forward. I don't necessarily feel comfortable deciding on whether the \nSPEAKER_00:  recidivism at our committee should be. \nSPEAKER_00:  Fold it into the reconciliation one or to like figure out where it lands, especially with Commissioner Allen not being here. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much for those comments. Any other comments, ideas, questions? \nSPEAKER_01:  So we'll forward with the motion. Madam Clerk, can we call for a vote? \nSPEAKER_02:  Motion is carried. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much. And we're going to go ahead and move on."
