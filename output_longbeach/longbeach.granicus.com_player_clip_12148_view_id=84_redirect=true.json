I'm very excited about this item. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I'll hand over for staff report. \nSPEAKER_01:  Excellent. Thank you chair and thank you committee members. As you know, we have been \nSPEAKER_01:  working on the restaurant retention plan. So what I wanted to do \nSPEAKER_01:  is give you a quick overview of the background to this project, which you directed back in December. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then I'm going to invite Dr. Seiji Steinmech to who is our economist for the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  And he has been working through a lot of this research and these economic reports that you commissioned. \nSPEAKER_01:  and ask Dr. Simon to give us an update as to what the initial findings are. So in terms of background, the council has been working on the restaurant retention strategies for some time. Going back to August, \nSPEAKER_01:  as part of the CARES Act. The council took several steps. \nSPEAKER_01:  puts substantial grant funding out to \nSPEAKER_01:  specifically restaurants. \nSPEAKER_01:  and dining and drinking establishments. Those entities that were hardest hit by COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_01:  And really, we are just... \nSPEAKER_01:  wrapping up the CARES Act part of this program. \nSPEAKER_01:  where the last of a couple million dollars have now been distributed to restaurants, dining, and drinking establishments in the city along beach. But also the Economic Development and Finance Committee advanced a recommendation on December 1st to the city council recommending the development of a restaurant retention strategy \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  This is what the council adopted was essentially on December 15th. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  directing the city manager to develop a comprehensive equitable \nSPEAKER_01:  Restaurant retention strategy. \nSPEAKER_01:  That would address a couple of things. \nSPEAKER_01:  application and approval process. \nSPEAKER_01:  this urgency ordinance for delivery fees. \nSPEAKER_01:  for our advertising restaurants in the next round of federal stimulus which we've done. \nSPEAKER_01:  providing regular public reporting on the distribution of federal stimulus funds. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've been doing that and I think the city manager will be distributing a report soon on those CARES Act activities. \nSPEAKER_01:  expediting and simplifying the business grant application process. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll talk a little bit about how we've been doing that. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then having shovel ready projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  in anticipation of a Recovery Act federal funding program. \nSPEAKER_01:  and Council took some action on March 16th. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  with regard to that. \nSPEAKER_01:  priority. \nSPEAKER_01:  So essentially it summarizes that \nSPEAKER_01:  the core components of \nSPEAKER_01:  of any retention strategy should. \nSPEAKER_01:  involve research, this financial assistance. \nSPEAKER_01:  We should be. \nSPEAKER_01:  circle back and get industry input from the Long Beach Restaurant Association and other \nSPEAKER_01:  business associations who work with restaurants, dining and drinking establishments. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then to establish a liaison or some sort of \nSPEAKER_01:  point of contact in city hall and we have \nSPEAKER_01:  some updates and recommendations about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then finally. \nSPEAKER_01:  Extendings of our outdoor dining programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  the extension of the third \nSPEAKER_01:  Party Delivery Fee Program. \nSPEAKER_01:  and in some recommendations about \nSPEAKER_01:  actual \nSPEAKER_01:  application for additional outdoor \nSPEAKER_01:  permitting. So we have made progress in all those which will provide a little bit today. \nSPEAKER_01:  the measures of success. So some of the things that we want to test and have our economic partners help us to assess are these key performance measures around the number of restaurants, how many can we retain, how many jobs are involved. Dr. Steinman, if we'll talk about that. \nSPEAKER_01:  How do we adjust issues of equity based on either where they're located or \nSPEAKER_01:  you know addressing the high need establishments. \nSPEAKER_01:  locally owned full service as an example. \nSPEAKER_01:  improving their resilience, what kind of programs are cities using. \nSPEAKER_01:  to strengthen restaurants in the recovery, but beyond. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then assessing business health and improving outreach and education. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the giant dining and drinking sector. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm really, I'm gonna ask \nSPEAKER_01:  Dr. Steinmetz to actually go through some of the findings. \nSPEAKER_01:  now but in terms of our timeline just so you're aware and we can come back to the slide after the discussion \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  We \nSPEAKER_01:  We've got our report in mid-March. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we are now in this area. \nSPEAKER_01:  where we're covering the input. \nSPEAKER_01:  trying to get input from both. \nSPEAKER_01:  community. \nSPEAKER_01:  and industry experts as well as the council. And so that's why we're here today with the committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  is to get that additional. \nSPEAKER_01:  input. \nSPEAKER_01:  to provide you with some of the results, but also hear your priorities and ideas. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then use that to inform. \nSPEAKER_01:  on what we do with this American Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  federal dollars that the council has already \nSPEAKER_01:  approved. \nSPEAKER_01:  how do we target those resources to implement aspects of this plan. So I'll come back to the slide after Dr. Simon. \nSPEAKER_01:  gives his presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so I'm going to stop sharing for the moment. \nSPEAKER_01:  But Dr. Stein mitz. \nSPEAKER_01:  while you load your presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  or share your screen. I was going to ask the chair to provide any additional comments before questions before you launch into your presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, I just want to thank both. \nSPEAKER_04:  Councilman Allen and Dr. Stymitt, we had an amazing economic forum and afterward Dr. Stymitt's and I sat for quite a while and discussed the status of the region, the status of Long Beach, how all these different factors on unemployment, local ownership, \nSPEAKER_04:  density all really are factoring into what's going on not just in our city center but on the peripheral too. Councilman Allen has a unique opportunity that the lion's share of her district has an extensive amount of Long Beach on every side of it versus say councilmember Richardson and I who are on the borders and have a lot more outside influences and so we kind of talked about what that means too so I'm thankful for his expertise and to have such an amazing resource right here in our own city and I look forward to hearing the presentation thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, thank you very much, Chair Mungo, is indeed a pleasure to discuss long-reaching policy and the economic conditions of the city with you. I learned a great deal from you. Councilmember Allen, thank you again for allowing me to address this group. And thank you to the city staff. I have to ask, can you see my screen okay? \nSPEAKER_00:  It should say, okay, good. So I'm going to try and keep this brief and full disclosure, I have to jump off and teach in a little bit. So I'm going to, I have to jump out at about 12, 2012, 25, but I'll try and leave time for questions. So John and his was demassed me to present a brief overview. Like what is the size of the issue? What is the size of the industry? \nSPEAKER_00:  So I'm going to do that. First, I'm going to give you sort of pre-COVID. What was the Long Beach restaurant industry and food service industry overall like in Long Beach before COVID hit? So up through, say, the first quarter of 2020. \nSPEAKER_00:  So there were about, if we look at food services and drinking places, employment. So these are restaurants and bars and take out places and so forth. There were about 17,000 jobs in Long Beach. So 17,000 wage and salary employees, not in County, not county proprietors. And in the last five, six years, there's been about 7% growth and employment in that sector. \nSPEAKER_00:  And by the way, we'll make these slides available, of course, to the committee. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now, if we look at the number of establishments, so how many actual eating and bar, how many restaurants and bars were there in the city? \nSPEAKER_00:  There are about 952, and that represents about a 14% growth since around 2015. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  by council districts. So if you want to see, you know, where's the concentration of all the food and drinking places? We see that about half of all the food service and drinking places in the city are concentrated in districts, council districts one, two, and three. That probably surprises no one. We have a heavy, if we look at this heat map here, there's a heavy concentration in the downtown area around Pine and Shoreline Village. And then of course, over by Belmont Shore. And then District 4 actually has a pretty strong concentration with about 12%, that includes the town center and so forth. And then the rest of the districts have about roughly equal shares of \nSPEAKER_00:  food and beverage places throughout the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, and again, I'm gonna go through this quickly, but please feel free to stop me if you have any questions. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right, let's look specifically at restaurants. We just look at where it's called full service and limited service restaurants. So full service restaurants are your traditional sit-down restaurants. Limited service is dominated primarily by fast food places, but other take-out establishments. \nSPEAKER_00:  In terms of wage and salary employment, there's about 8,000 full service restaurant employees who work in the Long Beach, and about 6,000 who work in limited service restaurants. We've seen fairly flat employment over the last five years or so in the full service restaurant industry. \nSPEAKER_00:  but about 17% growth in limited service restaurants. \nSPEAKER_00:  during that same time period. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Also looking at growth and establishments, if we just focus on restaurants, there's about 355 full service restaurants of Long Beach and about 344 limited service restaurants. So that's actually pretty wide. We have a large presence of full service sit down restaurants. For full service restaurants, they've seen about 11% growth over the last five years. \nSPEAKER_00:  Limited service restaurants have seen about 16% growth over the last five years. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now, John asked me, of course, to talk about our vocally-owned restaurants. Like, these are establishments that are in Long Beach, but are also operated by people who are in Long Beach. And as of the first quarter of last year, there were about 264 vocally-owned full-service Long Beach restaurants. So they employ about 4,400 employees. \nSPEAKER_00:  And about $100, a little over $100 million a year in annual payroll. \nSPEAKER_00:  If you look at all the long-beet restaurants, then all full-service restaurants is about 3.55, with about twice as many employees and about twice the payroll. So, loosely speaking, about half the payroll and half the employees in our restaurants are locally owned. And if you were to divide this number by this number, you get about 75% of the establishments in the city, the restaurant, full-service restaurants in the city are locally owned restaurants. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so that's uh... \nSPEAKER_00:  kind of an overview of employment that's based on these confidential data we have our special relationship we have through the city and with the California Employment Development Department. I mean get slightly abstract here but I think it's important to paint like a kind of a big picture. If we look at restaurants and bars in the city of Long Beach and we look at their economic contribution and I won't get into our economic impact analysis is done but I'll just say if we look at the multiplier effect right you have \nSPEAKER_00:  people spending money on restaurants and then those employees go out and spend money in the economy, including on other restaurants and other grocery stores and so forth. If we were to look at the total number of jobs supported or created by the restaurant industry, that's close to 20,000 jobs annually supported. And that this figure includes self employment. \nSPEAKER_00:  So that amounts to about $653 million a year in labor income, including self-employed income. \nSPEAKER_00:  In terms of total economic spending, that amounts to about 1.7 billion. So again, we're looking at restaurants and bars. That's about 1.7 billion annually in economic output that's generated. And that includes sales taxes and so forth. \nSPEAKER_00:  or in terms of if you're an economic geek like me and you want to talk about gross regional product. \nSPEAKER_00:  Long Beach's restaurant industry represents about 2.6 percent of the total gross regional product. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, so. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's our overview of the landscape. \nSPEAKER_00:  We can get a brief look at what the impacts were, primarily from the shutdown and get a sense of the trajectory of the recovery, understanding that we have fairly limited data. \nSPEAKER_00:  So if we're again looking just at restaurants, there was a sharp decline, about 72% decline in restaurant employment during the shutdown. \nSPEAKER_00:  And since from the shutdown through, when things started to open up a little bit, there was about a 28% gain. So our best estimate right now is there's about 11,000 or 12,000 people employed in the restaurant industry. \nSPEAKER_00:  If we looked at drinking places and special food services, the special food services think primarily catering establishments. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  Drinking places, again, saw a big drop, about a 78% drop like the restaurants, and then a fairly strong recovery as things started to open up. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  This is kind of... \nSPEAKER_00:  an area of concern possibly because for example the convention center hasn't been able to operate at full capacity and all and face-to-face events haven't been able to operate at full capacity. A lot of the food service businesses that support these face-to-face events are struggling to recover. There's been more of a decline, right? There hasn't been kind of any bounce back in the special food services industry that we saw in bars and restaurants. \nSPEAKER_00:  And if we look brought more broadly at the county. \nSPEAKER_00:  just to get a sense of the magnitude across the county. \nSPEAKER_00:  Again, in terms of percentage job losses, and I'm talking about now, this is through current pairs. So this is the most current data we have is at the county level. If we look through employment up through January, there's still about 61% fewer jobs in these catering type job employment since the beginning of last year. \nSPEAKER_00:  full service restaurants about half the employment. \nSPEAKER_00:  last year in the county. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then limited service restaurants like fast food haven't been hit as hard in percentage terms, but I think it's worth noting that the magnitude of the job loss \nSPEAKER_00:  is considerable understanding that these are typically the lower skilled workers. \nSPEAKER_00:  So. \nSPEAKER_00:  With that, I'm happy to answer any questions or go back and go over any of these slides, but thank you again to the committee and to the city staff for listening. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Dr. Simons. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and so for the council, for the committee, you know, what we're trying to do in this \nSPEAKER_01:  study session is to present you with the initial findings. These are high level. \nSPEAKER_01:  We also have a report that is about 35 pages. \nSPEAKER_01:  of \nSPEAKER_01:  best practices as well as a deeper dive on the restaurant industry. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the region. \nSPEAKER_01:  That was completed by Los Angeles. \nSPEAKER_01:  economic development corporation, which is a countywide. \nSPEAKER_01:  non-profit economic development corporation that has its own research institute. \nSPEAKER_01:  and by using some of our CARES Act funding. \nSPEAKER_01:  We were able to commission both the study. \nSPEAKER_01:  from LADC as well as \nSPEAKER_01:  on the data that \nSPEAKER_01:  Nick Schultz, our Executive Director for... \nSPEAKER_01:  for Pacific Gateway, who is able to get the Employment Development Department data you saw here today. \nSPEAKER_01:  as well as our \nSPEAKER_01:  our team at Cal State Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  to break down that data. \nSPEAKER_01:  in at a city level. \nSPEAKER_01:  Our next step, of course. \nSPEAKER_01:  is to meet with \nSPEAKER_01:  both this committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  as well as \nSPEAKER_01:  We've been having, we presented this information to the Long Beach Restaurant Association. \nSPEAKER_01:  but to receive input about \nSPEAKER_01:  how they interpret. \nSPEAKER_01:  as \nSPEAKER_01:  industry experts. \nSPEAKER_01:  some of these findings where the challenges and opportunities are. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then ultimately where the strategies \nSPEAKER_01:  should be focused as we... \nSPEAKER_01:  then deploy our federal \nSPEAKER_01:  American Recovery Act dollars. \nSPEAKER_01:  So at this time, \nSPEAKER_01:  What I'd like to do is ask for input from... \nSPEAKER_01:  the committee from the Chair Mungo Flanagan. Maybe you can kick us off. \nSPEAKER_01:  but \nSPEAKER_01:  What questions do you have or what? \nSPEAKER_01:  Priorities come to mind. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we're going to want to incorporate and staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the final restaurant recovery strategy that we hope to bring back. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the 4th City Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I'll show you our timeline. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're hoping to do that. \nSPEAKER_01:  You do some work in April, some outreach. \nSPEAKER_01:  After half the final report in May and have the final strategy done in June, \nSPEAKER_01:  because we believe that the recovery dollars will be start flowing from the federal government in later June. \nSPEAKER_01:  and into pockets of our business owners in July. So I'll stop there and turn it back over to the chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  But thank you, what a great report. I really appreciate all the information. I think that when we see that only 2.6% of the in-cut of the \nSPEAKER_04:  The city's economy is based on this industry. I think we have a lot of work to do in terms of understanding. \nSPEAKER_04:  where those levers are for the bigger industries and I feel that \nSPEAKER_00:  for those who want to. \nSPEAKER_04:  I've heard real estate is a big one with property management, ownership, construction, sales, transactions. I think we need to look at what other levers there are out there that we can do to be helpful. Councilman Allen, any comments? \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just want to say thank you very much. Dr. Sain has my note. You said you had a 1220. \nSPEAKER_03:  to get teaching so I just really appreciate your presentation. \nSPEAKER_03:  I love analytics. I love data just like you. And so I like how we're just really going to closely measure our success. We had good news today from the governor will be opening up hopefully in and \nSPEAKER_03:  and July so \nSPEAKER_03:  Hopefully we'll see these numbers get better, but thank you so much for your thoughtful presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Wonderful. If there's no other additional comments, then I think we appreciate the presentation and we'll take a vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  If there's a \nSPEAKER_02:  Can I get a motion in a second please? \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So nice. \nSPEAKER_04:  so, I was \nSPEAKER_04:  second. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_03:  Second. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry, I got the second. \nSPEAKER_02:  So this is for the boat. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think that's right. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, I... \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Vice Chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chairman Munga."

We have developed this chart that said we think the recovery from COVID-19, and this is the economic recovery, will start April 1st of 2021. \nSPEAKER_01:  We didn't have a lot of certainty at that time. In fact, \nSPEAKER_01:  in december uh... a december first and was was the date that we met as the economic development and finance committee \nSPEAKER_01:  We had just seen an incredible surge of COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_01:  related to the Thanksgiving holiday. \nSPEAKER_01:  that continued through Christmas and New Year's. \nSPEAKER_01:  and into mid to late January. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we didn't know as much as we know now. \nSPEAKER_01:  But \nSPEAKER_01:  We all as a committee said. \nSPEAKER_01:  Let's \nSPEAKER_01:  for paraplan. \nSPEAKER_01:  to be ready for a recovery that would start. \nSPEAKER_01:  April 1st of 2021 and guess what? \nSPEAKER_01:  we just moved into the orange tier and now as councilmember alan stated june 15th the governor has stated \nSPEAKER_01:  that he believes we can reopen the economy in the state of California. So \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  you have been \nSPEAKER_01:  shaping the strategy with \nSPEAKER_01:  A lot of vision. \nSPEAKER_01:  And ultimately I wanted to just \nSPEAKER_01:  reflect on the fact that when we started this process on December 1st. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  We really did recommend a pretty \nSPEAKER_01:  forward thinking. \nSPEAKER_01:  timeline for this plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  Where we are right now. \nSPEAKER_01:  on the city council direction. These were the four. \nSPEAKER_01:  key areas. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the council wanted to develop. \nSPEAKER_01:  a recovery strategy. The community outreach, which we've completed that first phase. \nSPEAKER_01:  incorporating the previously adopted plans and equity as \nSPEAKER_01:  a priority in this recovery strategy. \nSPEAKER_01:  identifying some legislative recommendations which we've been working on with the Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then of course the final report to council \nSPEAKER_01:  which was supposed to be no later than April 1st. \nSPEAKER_01:  but we delivered at March 16th. So that was the great... \nSPEAKER_01:  on a victory that the council adopted this plan on the 16th. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now that was a policy level plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  Here's a recap just a little bit about our community outreach, which you're very familiar with. \nSPEAKER_01:  over 25 meetings and \nSPEAKER_01:  and 350 participants. \nSPEAKER_01:  But here's what was really I think a key. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the seven. \nSPEAKER_01:  guiding principles about targeting our resources. \nSPEAKER_01:  vaccinating our service sector workforce. \nSPEAKER_01:  relaunching our business sector's hardest hit. \nSPEAKER_01:  because those are where we're going to get the most jobs back. \nSPEAKER_01:  But we also heard from our community outreach and our industry experts that generating customers \nSPEAKER_01:  was the essential strategy that would help them. \nSPEAKER_01:  to both leverage private sector spending. \nSPEAKER_01:  and reopen and recall. \nSPEAKER_01:  their workers. \nSPEAKER_01:  to their businesses. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  this issue of preventing real estate vacancies and then of course \nSPEAKER_01:  really delivering these programs through community-based partnerships. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  On March 16th, the City Manager delivered a plan to council. \nSPEAKER_01:  per the original direction of this committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  that really broke up the recommended spending for the American Recovery Plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  between these three categories. \nSPEAKER_01:  There were some additional. \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendations that night which have come forward to change these amounts slightly. \nSPEAKER_01:  But this is actually the report from the city manager that set aside over $50 million for 33 specific programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the council said. \nSPEAKER_01:  Move forward with. \nSPEAKER_01:  economic development department. \nSPEAKER_01:  and start implementing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Goddime ! \nSPEAKER_01:  or bring recommendations for an implementation plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  The last slide I'll show you is \nSPEAKER_01:  kind of the breakdown of that $50 million. So this is a recap that \nSPEAKER_01:  about $13 million of that money was targeted toward \nSPEAKER_01:  business and worker protection. So how do we provide the ongoing support? \nSPEAKER_01:  to connect businesses and workers with \nSPEAKER_01:  resources that could be anything from \nSPEAKER_01:  contact tracing, epidemiological \nSPEAKER_01:  support. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  Direct business support, these are the grants, the $25,000, which is \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  50% \nSPEAKER_01:  of the funding is recommended just to go straight into the pockets of our businesses and nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_01:  to help them. \nSPEAKER_01:  deal with that \nSPEAKER_01:  and reopening. \nSPEAKER_01:  economic inclusion, a number of recommendations around. \nSPEAKER_01:  the formation of an economic empowerment fund. \nSPEAKER_01:  the development of economic empowerment zones. \nSPEAKER_01:  in special district. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then cleaning up the commercial quarters five million dollars for clean cities to work with our public works departments and clean teams \nSPEAKER_01:  Help. \nSPEAKER_01:  bring customers back out. \nSPEAKER_01:  to spend money. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then finally technical assistance. How do we... \nSPEAKER_01:  both report on these programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  How do we make sure that we continue to track performance? \nSPEAKER_01:  of the plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then create transparency so people know where the money went. \nSPEAKER_01:  and how it impacted the local economy. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's a very short update about what Council approved on March 16th. \nSPEAKER_01:  And here's what I'm recommending for the study session today. \nSPEAKER_01:  Based on my discussions with Chairman Gouflan again is that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  Council approved a very policy level. \nSPEAKER_01:  set of recommendations. \nSPEAKER_01:  We now as professionals need to \nSPEAKER_01:  dig down and develop. \nSPEAKER_01:  business plans for each of those programmatic \nSPEAKER_01:  goals and objectives. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  The study session today. \nSPEAKER_01:  on April 6th is really our first time and this was only about three weeks ago, less than three weeks ago that we were in front of Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  uh... with the big recovery plan \nSPEAKER_01:  But now it's time for us. \nSPEAKER_01:  to start. \nSPEAKER_01:  Developing. \nSPEAKER_01:  Programmatic implementation plans for each of those 33. \nSPEAKER_01:  areas that council approve. \nSPEAKER_01:  $50 million worth of recovery act money. \nSPEAKER_01:  Their federal government is likely \nSPEAKER_01:  going to give us \nSPEAKER_01:  some regulations about how that money can be spent. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  in April. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're likely going to continue to work on based on the feedback today from the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the committee, I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to start working on structuring these program plans. \nSPEAKER_01:  to get those dollars out to the community. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then likely we'll come back at the beginning of May. \nSPEAKER_01:  to this committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  to give you a much deeper dive on the specifics of those programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  on. \nSPEAKER_01:  in early May. \nSPEAKER_01:  The council is likely to see. \nSPEAKER_01:  grant agreements coming back from the federal government. This would be \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, the different federal agencies that are going to actually manage. \nSPEAKER_01:  and distribute the funding that was approved by the Congress. \nSPEAKER_01:  the $1.9 trillion. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  We will then also need to draft. \nSPEAKER_01:  A user friendly plan, a communications that the community and the council can use. \nSPEAKER_01:  to understand. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know what what the programs are. \nSPEAKER_01:  how they can access them. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  when they can expect to see the funding. \nSPEAKER_01:  come forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  Amen. \nSPEAKER_01:  We expect to see. \nSPEAKER_01:  an application process for this funding. \nSPEAKER_01:  After we've got those grant agreements approved by Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we've got the approval. \nSPEAKER_01:  from the federal government that we might need in terms of eligibility. \nSPEAKER_01:  And finally. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  we would want to launch. \nSPEAKER_01:  get that money start flowing into the pockets of \nSPEAKER_01:  our businesses and our nonprofits. \nSPEAKER_01:  in July, so the third quarter of this year. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is a 90 day process that I am. \nSPEAKER_01:  presenting to you right now. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I wanted to make sure that we \nSPEAKER_01:  Now that we have council approval to move forward to the next stage. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  is able to weigh in with your own recommendations on \nSPEAKER_01:  What's next so I'm going to stop there. \nSPEAKER_01:  that was a lot but i'll hand it back to chair \nSPEAKER_01:  Long ago, Flanagan to open up the discussion. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  You're talking about development of these programs and putting money in the hands of the individuals that need it most. I guess one of my challenges is the understanding that only half of the money is available now. So are you planning to \nSPEAKER_03:  award people a full amount where they get two checks to check now and to check that they can count on the date certain. \nSPEAKER_03:  or are we going to prioritize these projects or prime for year one and these projects are prime for year two, where these programs are going to take longer to roll out. So they'll be year two. \nSPEAKER_03:  What does that look like? And then we wanna make sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think Councilman Allen probably has a lot to say on this one. Like, we want to make sure that... \nSPEAKER_03:  The funding's there now, but that it's not. \nSPEAKER_03:  two short term. We heard a lot of feedback from the moms. \nSPEAKER_03:  with the child care funding. Like, oh, great. \nSPEAKER_03:  You had an infuse of cash for one month, but that doesn't. \nSPEAKER_03:  give me the ability to give back to work permanently, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  So what does the long-term strategy look like on some of these programs? \nSPEAKER_03:  that are more designed for a longer recovery. And do we hope that... \nSPEAKER_03:  say, for instance, childcare would only be necessary for one year. \nSPEAKER_03:  that we would want to use all of that up front. So I think we need to see from you where you think \nSPEAKER_03:  each pot. \nSPEAKER_03:  is so we can prioritize the year one projects. \nSPEAKER_03:  Councilman Allen. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I'm just adding on to I agree. \nSPEAKER_02:  Share with everything that you said and then just making sure that access to these funds are are simple and easy. \nSPEAKER_02:  to get. I you know we heard that a lot you know in the round tables. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I just think that let's just always be careful about that. That this is not very complicated for our businesses and for especially, you know, like you talked about childcare. \nSPEAKER_03:  great points when you talk about simplicity it's also important to add to that. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have a lot of. \nSPEAKER_03:  groups or companies. \nSPEAKER_03:  night. \nSPEAKER_03:  fall in multiple categories, right? \nSPEAKER_03:  So someone might be both a nonprofit and a child care provider. Someone might be a this or that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And we also don't want them to have to go and do six applications. \nSPEAKER_03:  We need to come up with something that's simple and easy in one form and they can check mark the boxes of the categories they fit into. And then for us on the admin side to figure out what part of money it's coming out of, as long as it's getting to the community. \nSPEAKER_03:  without making it too difficult on some of these groups. \nSPEAKER_03:  I mean, another example, like here's one, the YNCA. \nSPEAKER_03:  their fitness so they can be in the personal services. They're a non-profit. They're in child care. There's just so many. And they've been doing food delivery during this time of need. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then I did get a question this week about churches. \nSPEAKER_03:  Our churches have really been \nSPEAKER_03:  a bedrock of survival for communities. \nSPEAKER_03:  and these churches are struggling. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I don't know if there's a specific category that they're in. \nSPEAKER_03:  and if they're not. \nSPEAKER_03:  We need to figure out where they fit. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Excellent. \nSPEAKER_01:  And these are, I am taking notes now. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't have answers to all these questions. \nSPEAKER_01:  An example would be... \nSPEAKER_01:  a church that may be applying as a nonprofit service provider versus a religious institution. \nSPEAKER_01:  That may be... \nSPEAKER_01:  That may be handled differently based on \nSPEAKER_01:  the federal regulations that we get back. So what we'll have to do \nSPEAKER_01:  is take into consideration the questions you've asked. \nSPEAKER_00:  is. \nSPEAKER_01:  and we'll... \nSPEAKER_01:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_01:  We'll unwrap those to the process that our government affairs offices is using. \nSPEAKER_01:  on to get clarification on some of those. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know eligibility requirements. \nSPEAKER_01:  So I want you to know that some of it we may be able to handle at the local level. \nSPEAKER_01:  some of it may be city policy which will share with the city manager's office. \nSPEAKER_01:  and bring back to the council. \nSPEAKER_01:  And some of it may be... \nSPEAKER_01:  federal policy that we'll see clarification for. \nSPEAKER_01:  but include in \nSPEAKER_01:  the response back when we come in May to this committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have a lot of work to do. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so I want to make sure that it's part of this study session. \nSPEAKER_01:  if there are other priorities. \nSPEAKER_01:  questions you're getting from the community. \nSPEAKER_01:  additional community outreach that we need to conduct. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm happy to take those additional notes now. \nSPEAKER_02:  John, I definitely like to just say one thing really quickly. I'm telling you, I'm hearing a lot of great things from the community and the businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that we've done better than anybody else. I mean, getting out there and really hearing. \nSPEAKER_02:  what the issues were. \nSPEAKER_02:  We were on the forefront when it came to getting shots and people's arms. \nSPEAKER_02:  and even what we're doing here with this economic recovery strategy. So I just, I can't say Kudas enough to you and your teams and the city staff and all of our partners. \nSPEAKER_02:  that we're in the position that we are in today. \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you talk to me a little bit more about your developing business plans? How is that going to be done? \nSPEAKER_02:  And, and then what sectors or what verticals are you going to be doing that with? So if I can understand a little bit more about that, that would be great. \nSPEAKER_01:  absolutely \nSPEAKER_01:  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to stop sharing that presentation, but also bring up. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the memo that the city council received. \nSPEAKER_01:  There were some of those. \nSPEAKER_01:  policy decisions approved by Council. So as an example. \nSPEAKER_01:  on \nSPEAKER_01:  on the night of March 16th. \nSPEAKER_01:  The city manager presented. \nSPEAKER_01:  a breakdown in the economic support section. \nSPEAKER_01:  of about 33 different programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  and some of them call them those sectors. \nSPEAKER_01:  So an example of that. \nSPEAKER_01:  would be in the restaurant. \nSPEAKER_01:  sector. \nSPEAKER_01:  where \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, dining and drinking establishments. \nSPEAKER_01:  they were specifically called out as by the city council \nSPEAKER_01:  and you know backed up by \nSPEAKER_01:  community feedback and economic research, some of which was shared earlier by \nSPEAKER_01:  Dr. Steinath. \nSPEAKER_01:  But \nSPEAKER_01:  really what \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, is going to drive. \nSPEAKER_01:  Those recommendations is contained in \nSPEAKER_01:  This very long battle. \nSPEAKER_01:  that \nSPEAKER_01:  that backs up the recommendations approved by Council. So. \nSPEAKER_01:  This is actually an attachment in that 200 page memo. \nSPEAKER_01:  that the city manager presented to the city council on March 16th. \nSPEAKER_01:  So the reason I'm bringing this up is that some of those \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  The answer is to some of the questions that you raised. \nSPEAKER_01:  are in this memo. This is Council. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, broader direction, which has, for instance, $5 million set aside. \nSPEAKER_01:  as direct grants to restaurants, bars, and breweries. \nSPEAKER_01:  and it defines \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, that the upward. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  working capital grant as $25,000. So \nSPEAKER_01:  We're now diving into this particular program council member. \nSPEAKER_01:  with the Long Beach Restaurant Association. \nSPEAKER_01:  We've dug into some of the economic research Dr. Steinmeck's presented to them about, hey, what's happening with employment? \nSPEAKER_01:  on. \nSPEAKER_01:  What happened with full service? \nSPEAKER_01:  Sit down locally on restaurants. \nSPEAKER_01:  versus what happened. \nSPEAKER_01:  with delivery. \nSPEAKER_01:  or quick serve or takeout restaurants. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so \nSPEAKER_01:  that the answer to your question about. \nSPEAKER_01:  How do we drill down now into business plans? \nSPEAKER_01:  is that using those seven guiding principles of a targeted approach. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going and targeting the highest need. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're going to be... \nSPEAKER_01:  with our staff internally, with our community partners, like the Restaurant Association. \nSPEAKER_01:  digging into the economic research that's contained in this big memo. \nSPEAKER_01:  as well as the community feedback. \nSPEAKER_01:  and talking about \nSPEAKER_01:  How do we... \nSPEAKER_01:  target those \nSPEAKER_01:  who can bring back who have the highest need. \nSPEAKER_01:  and could bring back the most employees. \nSPEAKER_01:  recover the most lost jobs. \nSPEAKER_01:  And some of that will be very specific. \nSPEAKER_01:  to those sectors of those industries. Another example is that we've been meeting with \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, small gyms and fitness businesses. We've been meeting with Barbershoff and Solans. We've been meeting with nonprofit organizations. So each business plan involves additional community outreach, looking at the data, asking and answering those questions about high impact. \nSPEAKER_01:  And then our goal is by May 4th. \nSPEAKER_01:  to come back with \nSPEAKER_01:  A summary. \nSPEAKER_01:  of some of those recommendations for the implementation of these larger \nSPEAKER_01:  on. \nSPEAKER_01:  funding allocations that the council has approved. \nSPEAKER_01:  We got to do this in about over the next three weeks to get a general, you know, a much more specific business plan back. And then we will start to show. \nSPEAKER_01:  the Countless Committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  Here's what we heard back and here's what we're going to recommend as a grant process for these groups. \nSPEAKER_02:  haha \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  All right, well, thank you for that. Yeah, I have that here in front of me. So my understanding is that every single line item, which I think or 38 here, will have a business plan. \nSPEAKER_02:  afternoon. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Wow, okay, I got it. Okay, thank you for clarifying that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Wonderful. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. Very receiving. \nSPEAKER_03:  I made the motion. Councilman Allen seconded. I think we need a roll call vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would just a couple comments. \nSPEAKER_04:  Council Member. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh, Council Member Richardson, you've joined us. Great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I'll be ending out. \nSPEAKER_04:  and have some technical issues. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I think this is great. \nSPEAKER_04:  What I would say is with these allocations. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  Yo. \nSPEAKER_04:  I want to make sure that \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it's time that we, on some of these, we reconvene some of the stakeholders. \nSPEAKER_04:  around, like for example. \nSPEAKER_04:  Economic power in the zone came out of everyone in past four. \nSPEAKER_04:  And there was implementation plan task force and it stopped the end of the pandemic. I think we need to pull some of those folks back together. \nSPEAKER_04:  the implementation plan to talk about. \nSPEAKER_04:  specifically a few of these. One, the procurement study. \nSPEAKER_04:  Like now we have funding for procurement. \nSPEAKER_04:  and we sort of have a high level vision. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  I think now it's time we pull some of the folks back together and dust that off. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know a council member Allen is really interested in the pyramid conversation. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that is something I'm interested in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Also the economic empowerment zones. I know there's interest in creating another type of zone program as well in the Asian districts, whatever. I think all that's cool. \nSPEAKER_04:  but the economic power in zone is something very specific. \nSPEAKER_04:  You got right, babe. \nSPEAKER_04:  came through that process and through the council. So I think we want to reconvene some of those. \nSPEAKER_04:  from those folks from everyone to ask for. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think the, um, \nSPEAKER_04:  There was \nSPEAKER_04:  the conversation on \nSPEAKER_04:  down payment assistance and the community land trust. We're all, we're both in the \nSPEAKER_04:  implementation plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I think we can. \nSPEAKER_04:  So those things that came directly from everyone in. \nSPEAKER_04:  I want to read from being that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Reconving that group. \nSPEAKER_04:  and kind of make sure that we're connected, the dots. \nSPEAKER_04:  and and um \nSPEAKER_04:  sort of accelerating. Where we don't have to start from scratch, I really don't think we should. I think. \nSPEAKER_04:  The more we can kind of build on what you've done, I think. \nSPEAKER_04:  better. \nSPEAKER_04:  But I think this is a lot of work you have here. This is, I mean, it's great. We're in a great place here that we have all of these. \nSPEAKER_04:  things finally funded. \nSPEAKER_03:  to be losing. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think we lost him. I've seen him go in and out three or four times now. I'm going to need to get that result before \nSPEAKER_02:  before he, but I do appreciate him bringing up the procurement because I'm, you know, that's something even before I was running, I was interested in John, you know, with the Lumberjack Anomic Partnership is. \nSPEAKER_02:  is um \nSPEAKER_02:  Obviously, our minority own businesses are women own businesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then when I start thinking about procurement, I definitely think there's more work that we can do there. \nSPEAKER_02:  a more transparency on these local businesses and minority and women's businesses. So I appreciate. \nSPEAKER_02:  appreciate council our vice mayor Rex, which is in bringing that up. Are you're back? \nSPEAKER_04:  Sorry, yeah, sorry, I keep getting kicked out. This is like my third time being kicked out. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. Now, now that's the point. I think. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think just the ones I go with. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think we need to bring the task force back, talk about some of these economic inclusion strategies. \nSPEAKER_04:  and connect dots. \nSPEAKER_04:  on things like the includes the procurement stuff. \nSPEAKER_04:  the economic and powerful zones. \nSPEAKER_04:  even the stuff around like youth workforce development. We need, I think we need to. \nSPEAKER_04:  or go back. \nSPEAKER_04:  Go back to the genus. \nSPEAKER_04:  The other thing I'll say is \nSPEAKER_04:  separately from that. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, I'm interested in how we do this, but... \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, there's... \nSPEAKER_04:  We have to take another look at CDBG. \nSPEAKER_04:  separately from all this funding. \nSPEAKER_04:  is I think it's time. \nSPEAKER_04:  $2,000 CDBG grants. \nSPEAKER_04:  They're not going very far. It's time for us to be thinking bigger. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great tool let. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right, we're going to be taking this on a third ledge where there's going to be more significant investments to see the GG. I think packet bombing development has to be thinking right now. \nSPEAKER_04:  about retooling how we use. \nSPEAKER_04:  C to B, G. \nSPEAKER_04:  Section 101 loans. \nSPEAKER_04:  larger projects. \nSPEAKER_04:  and CDBG areas. \nSPEAKER_04:  CWT is directly telling us what we're talking about. \nSPEAKER_04:  because it's in the same areas as economic empowerment. They're the same areas. \nSPEAKER_04:  So they should really speak to each other. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know there's been interest in the economic development department being more interested, more involved in the CDPG work. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's time to do it. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it's now. \nSPEAKER_04:  Those are my thoughts on. Hope you have. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. I do want to add some context. I recognize the economic problem. \nSPEAKER_03:  Economic empowerment zones were in our original blueprint and on the everyone in and that's great. \nSPEAKER_03:  in meetings though. \nSPEAKER_04:  because if they weren't in the blueprint, they weren't in the blueprint. \nSPEAKER_04:  back in our empowerment zone, whether the blueprint. \nSPEAKER_03:  There was some discussions about them back when we were doing business, corridor grants. \nSPEAKER_03:  So in talking with. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you for joining us. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  But that's not where this term comes from. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  If you don't mind, I have the floor. \nSPEAKER_03:  I... I... \nSPEAKER_03:  worked really hard to listen to you as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  And in discussions related to I can't think of empowerment zones and innovation zones. \nSPEAKER_03:  Some of the reason behind fighting so hard for the amount of money to be increased is so that there would be eight different zones across the city that touched. \nSPEAKER_03:  on. \nSPEAKER_03:  many different areas that were both two parts. One, lifting up areas of our city that were important, but also investing in areas of our city that really needed some innovation. For instance, Councilmember Orenge has a corridor that \nSPEAKER_03:  was really \nSPEAKER_03:  in need of a study and \nSPEAKER_03:  economic development director Kaisler kind of discussed in some of the forums that this would be an opportunity. So yes, it is the economic empowerment zones, but when this was brought to council, it was really brought as more than that. It was to build on both the everyone in, but also \nSPEAKER_03:  other needs of the city that have come up that have not been included in a plan. And so I appreciate your perspective. \nSPEAKER_03:  but I also think that there's some context that perhaps John or Sergio can bring up that's also important. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you for your comments on that and I appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_04:  If I could, if I could just... \nSPEAKER_04:  for spine to be done. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I think we're talking about two different things. \nSPEAKER_04:  So economic apartment zones weren't a part of the pooper. \nSPEAKER_04:  Economic and Powerman zones came out of everyone in round tables. \nSPEAKER_04:  and there was a presentation at council. I made a proposal. \nSPEAKER_04:  two years ago. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm happy to. \nSPEAKER_04:  to send the original item. \nSPEAKER_01:  and familiar. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this was about looking at \nSPEAKER_04:  areas of town. \nSPEAKER_04:  that have dealt with the same economic conditions for general action. \nSPEAKER_04:  and that we have to think about a place-based strategy. \nSPEAKER_04:  for change the conditions of the majority. \nSPEAKER_04:  So, originally, so that. \nSPEAKER_04:  That doesn't preclude us from identifying a different zone program, innovation zone. \nSPEAKER_04:  but economic empowerment's own. \nSPEAKER_04:  was not an eight zone. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  three air. \nSPEAKER_04:  is North Central West. \nSPEAKER_04:  Now, it doesn't preclude. \nSPEAKER_04:  Again, special districts. \nSPEAKER_04:  other things. But... \nSPEAKER_04:  When we talk about the term economic empowerment zone, \nSPEAKER_04:  There was great discussion about how we name it. \nSPEAKER_04:  How he proposed it. \nSPEAKER_04:  At all camera counsel, they got your name is, oh. \nSPEAKER_04:  closed for everyone. \nSPEAKER_04:  Now, innovation's on absolutely. I think all that's great, all those things are great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Economical for purposes. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would urge you go back, listen to the council presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  and the Council President takes the happy to share it. \nSPEAKER_04:  but that's what economic impact. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so that, direct. \nSPEAKER_04:  through the implementations plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  that everyone in playing. back Opp Cuba. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that's how it landed in this plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we're working from. \nSPEAKER_04:  So those recommendations may then be reconcorded. You can plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then our motion for the inclusive recovery May of December. \nSPEAKER_04:  that take recommendations from the recommendations from the reconciliation plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  can place it here. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  So what I don't want to do is confuse the public about what that is. \nSPEAKER_04:  We can say it doesn't preclude any new idea. \nSPEAKER_04:  for a different life. \nSPEAKER_04:  but economic and armoured zone, it's something that came out of the community. \nSPEAKER_04:  and something very specific. \nSPEAKER_04:  and I root the most. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I'm very familiar with what that is. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I appreciate that Mr. Richardson. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate that. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. Well, I appreciate that. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  When Mr. Kisler presented it to me when I was voting on it, it included much more than that. It included special economic zones in the area. It was not the same wording. It was expanding upon that because we're at a time where lots of things need to be included. In multiple roundtables, Mr. Kisler has already spoken to this specifically at the economic development partnership and other areas. And so I appreciate where the root of it was. But \nSPEAKER_03:  We're kind of further than that now. And if if John represented that, and that's how we voted on it, and we need to change the name, then we can do that. But 2.5 million was identified because there were eight areas that Mr. Keisler identified. Mr. Keisler, any additional comments on that? \nSPEAKER_03:  If we need to bring it back to council, we can, but we cannot. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think that might mean. \nSPEAKER_03:  Excuse me, sir. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll see you in my next video. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  You look interrupted multiple times and I really appreciate it if we could have to quorum this. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Go for it. \nSPEAKER_03:  It just have not felt very... \nSPEAKER_03:  I know there's some technology differences here and I know we're working through that, perhaps you and I can talk offline. But Mr. Kyser, do you wanna, I am feeling right now that \nSPEAKER_03:  what you're saying is not in alignment with what Mr. Kisler has been saying. And what I have continued to say and I hope my colleagues would join me is that the most important thing about this was listening to the community and they were very specific about additional things. And while the everyone in plan was important, after the everyone in plan, you brought an item asking the community to come to the table again and be heard. And then at the last agenda of this committee you said it wasn't that important that we listened to the community. You said we keep having all these round tables and listening and the same things keep coming up. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  We were fearless \nSPEAKER_03:  And I have not heard. \nSPEAKER_04:  I never said that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Richardson, you talk a lot about Decora and being respectful and I feel like you've maimed splainz me a little bit. \nSPEAKER_03:  and that \nSPEAKER_03:  that you would not be okay with the back and forth that you're doing with me right now. And I just don't feel it's the double standard is appropriate. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm really disappointed. I'd like to call for a vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  You sure you want to hear from John? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, and for response. I'd love to hear your Johnson. \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, so that was awesome. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Kitesler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so thank you. Ultimately, ultimately, this discussion is \nSPEAKER_01:  This is what we need to have. \nSPEAKER_01:  So. \nSPEAKER_01:  what the city manager what we've included which you know I will \nSPEAKER_01:  take full responsibility for the economic support recommendations. \nSPEAKER_01:  the language that we've used. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's time to refine it and it's time to put something together that the council \nSPEAKER_01:  really \nSPEAKER_01:  you know stand behind supports and includes your priorities. \nSPEAKER_01:  So ultimately these programs will come back. \nSPEAKER_01:  not just to this committee but to the council. \nSPEAKER_01:  The effort that we have right now is taking something that is more general. \nSPEAKER_01:  in more high level sort of policy recommendations. \nSPEAKER_01:  It includes \nSPEAKER_01:  many, many different types of programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  And we did our best. \nSPEAKER_01:  to get something that was \nSPEAKER_01:  not overly detailed but provided counsel with some flexibility in terms of \nSPEAKER_01:  how we refine the priorities, the names, the definitions. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're here now. So I want you to know that this is \nSPEAKER_01:  what we expected is that we would come back. \nSPEAKER_01:  both to the committee as well as to some of the stakeholders who are involved in some of these initial recommendations to now take it to a much, much more specific and detailed level so that it is actionable and operational. Now they're, you know, just as incomplete, of course, even this attachment here, some of these amounts have changed. They've actually been increased. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so that's a good thing. That's a great thing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bruce887 Kook \nSPEAKER_01:  So I want to make sure that you, you know, we're on the same page with regard to the process. This is the time to now start to become more specific. And this discussion about some of the key programs that are important to you all, having a public forum to discuss those programs is the goal of the committee. And ultimately, we're going to get to yes, we're going to get somewhere. \nSPEAKER_01:  that all of the Youth Committee members. \nSPEAKER_01:  feel represents the goals of the community as well as the council before we finalize anything. So I just want you to know this was the next step. We took the first step on March 16th. \nSPEAKER_01:  and now we're taking the next step into implementation plans. But nothing is going to get finalized before \nSPEAKER_01:  We come back and my last, this would be my last statement about timing. \nSPEAKER_01:  is that some of these programs may take \nSPEAKER_01:  many, many months to get right. You know, we may not roll them out. \nSPEAKER_01:  in the first quarter, like I'm recommending for some programs. \nSPEAKER_01:  on some of the direct release may need to get out there quicker. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so in terms of timing, Councilmember Mungo, you had mentioned. \nSPEAKER_01:  that maybe half the funding is made available by the federal government. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  This committee may make some recommendations about prioritizing certain programs in this portfolio. \nSPEAKER_01:  because \nSPEAKER_01:  They have a greater impact. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know at this time in the recovery. \nSPEAKER_01:  others may take a little bit more time to reconvene stakeholders. \nSPEAKER_01:  bring on additional expertise. \nSPEAKER_01:  develop plans that we can then bring back to council. But I just want you to know we will be coming back. \nSPEAKER_01:  to the full council. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  whether or not there is not a specific number. \nSPEAKER_01:  of zones or districts in this plan. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have talked to all of you about your priorities and so we will continue to do that before any final recommendations are brought forth. And if this one needs, \nSPEAKER_01:  more time. \nSPEAKER_01:  then we'll give it more time. But nothing will be implemented without \nSPEAKER_01:  City Council direction. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Kisler, did we not make a presentation to the Economic Development Partnership? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  where it was represented as both economic and innovation zones. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we talked about that. There were discussions about, hey, is this geographically specific? Could this be something that is sector specific? And the answer was, well, yes, we can include all of that in a recommendation. \nSPEAKER_01:  But whether it's called a zone or a district or whether it's, you know, how the specific purpose \nSPEAKER_01:  That's going to be defined, I think, through these conversations. We're reconvening with some of those sector, you know, leaders, some of those community leaders as well that we talked to in the first round. So I just want you to know that this language here that you're seeing on your screen. \nSPEAKER_01:  other than my \nSPEAKER_01:  updates that are coming. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  This language is the first step for the city manager to say here's a very broad \nSPEAKER_01:  set of recommendations and now we begin to drill down. \nSPEAKER_03:  But I think it is specific at the meeting when people asked you specifically answered. \nSPEAKER_03:  that they did not have to be a geographically specific and that they could be innovation zones. And I think that it's really important that the intent that was funding was associated with it also be acknowledged. And if we want to make a change, \nSPEAKER_03:  then these groups need to know that change because multiple people have called me. \nSPEAKER_03:  I just got a call from Ward Mace two days ago. \nSPEAKER_03:  discussing items like this that came up in another forum that I was not in attendance. \nSPEAKER_00:  Discussing. \nSPEAKER_03:  And so I think it's really important that as a city. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  when you and I spoke. \nSPEAKER_03:  It was eight zones. And I don't know all those zones because I didn't write them. I didn't pick them, but they are not in alignment with what Mr. Richardson's original intent was. If it was expanded upon it, then we need to be honest. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  And you can have a conversation right. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  because the community is already creating constituencies that are in need. \nSPEAKER_03:  and believe that they are part of this solution. And if a community member on this team says, \nSPEAKER_03:  Let's for a. \nSPEAKER_03:  what I have seen continually happen is the first one to make a statement. \nSPEAKER_03:  the train leaves the track and then it's what we have voted on it unanimously and unanimously and unanimously. All of us are here to support one another in their ideas. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  And when those expansions happen, we have to be acknowledging it. And if this money needs to be separated into two different pots. \nSPEAKER_03:  Then maybe we need a proposal from Mr. Kysler on how that would work because there are some specific bringbacks. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  for the corridor that Mr. Odainga has. I know that there was one that was talked about related to space industry. There was one related to downtown that was not in the DLBA. Those are really important. We need to know what all of those are. So thank you for your feedback, Mr. Kites. I'd like to call for the vote. \nSPEAKER_00:  \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e more \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Vice-chair Richardson. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair Mangal \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. Was that our last agenda item? I don't have my agenda in front of me. \nSPEAKER_00:  That was our last agenda item and then we do not have any telephonic public comments for this meeting. \nSPEAKER_03:  Wonderful. Thank you. Meeting adjourned. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you."
