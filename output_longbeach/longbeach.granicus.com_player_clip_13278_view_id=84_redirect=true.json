This is Grace Yoon, budget office and glad to see you all today as we get ready for our BOC season. For this presentation, we have Demarra Johnson, a budget analyst who will provide this a report. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  to see you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Good afternoon, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. This presentation is to provide you with an overview of the proposed FY23 budget early community engagement process, as well as various upcoming opportunities to engage on the budget before budget adoption in September. \nSPEAKER_01:  This presentation will include a summary of the early community engagement process, discuss both the qualitative and quantitative feedback received from the community, offer opportunities to engage on the proposed FY23 budget, provide communication resources, and answer any questions that may arise. \nSPEAKER_01:  In response to the mayor and city council's request to conduct a more robust and earlier community engagement process as a part of the FY 23 budget development, city staff conducted community engagement activities in January 2022 prior to the development of any budget proposals. The earlier engagement included two virtual community meetings held on January 25, 2022 and January 27, 2022. The engagement efforts also included the distribution and collection of the FY 23 budget priority survey, which opened on December 22, 2021 and closed January 28, 2022. \nSPEAKER_01:  The goals of this process included increase outreach to and participation of broader demographic groups. The community meetings were promoted on the FY 23 budget website and the city calendar and widely distributed through social media and department newsletters, including the Go Long Beach newsletter and the neighborhood resources center listserv. Advertisements were purchased on the 405 freeway digital billboard and print flyers for the community meetings were also made available at each of the library branches. For both the community meetings, Spanish, Camai and Tegalic interpretation services were provided. The budget priority serving and community meeting flyer were also made of dailable and multiple languages. \nSPEAKER_01:  Overall, we had 141 attendees at the community meetings and a total of 723 survey respondents to the budget priority survey. \nSPEAKER_01:  In the following slides, I'll provide highlights of the feedback we received through the early community engagement process. This information was previously provided to the City Council in a minimal issued on May 3rd that provided greater detail on the results. \nSPEAKER_01:  During the virtual community meetings conducted on the Zoom platform, attendees were asked to give their thoughts on city services and communicate which city service were most important to them. Staff took proactive measures to capture and analyze all verbal and written comments in the chat box made by the community. And afterwards, staff collaborated with ZIN City to synthesize this data. \nSPEAKER_01:  This slide shows the top 13 responses reflecting city priorities. The top priorities include, included addressing homelessness and providing sufficient affordable housing. \nSPEAKER_01:  As in previous years, the city manager's office coordinated and coordinated the distribution and analysis of the budget priority survey, which as participants to rate 39 different city services as being very important, somewhat important, not very important or not at all important. This slide shows the top 10 ranked services from this year compared to last year survey results. Similar to the FY22 budget priority survey, the top three services relating to infrastructure and public safety continues to be top of mind for survey respondents. \nSPEAKER_01:  The items highlighted in green in the left column have been newly ranked in the top 10, while the items in red on the right column have dropped out of the top 10. \nSPEAKER_01:  An element of the budget priority survey included providing qualitative feedback on city service priorities. This was conducted through an open-ended comment box for community members to complete. \nSPEAKER_01:  The collection of these comments were then ranked for most to lease important. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm sorry, most to least mention. \nSPEAKER_01:  This slide shows the top ranked themes with combating crime and investing in public safety resources, alleviating homelessness and improvements to infrastructure and being the top three themes. Again, the four details of the results can be found in the May 3, memo. \nSPEAKER_01:  In addition to weighing city council priorities, the proposed budget makes investments and to many of the priority service areas identified through the community engagement process. \nSPEAKER_01:  The list on the left provides the city service priority areas that have additional investments being added as a part of the proposed FY 23 budget. You can see that many of these items rank in the top list of issues raised by the community. For example, addressing homelessness, ranks first in the community meetings, and second in the budget priority survey comments. Many of the top listed priorities aligns directly with investments made within the city managers proposed FY 23 budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  As we look forward to the rest of the budget development process, residents and community members can engage in the budget process by attending the budget hearings, budget oversight committee meetings, virtual committee, community meetings, completing the digital comment card or access online and other resources. \nSPEAKER_01:  Throughout the month of August, there will be a series of budget hearings where departments will be presenting the proposed budgets for their departments. The City Council, as well as the community, will have an opportunity to provide comment and discuss. \nSPEAKER_01:  We held our first two hearings on December 7, 2021, and March 8, 2022 that discussed the outlook and plan for a proposed budget development. Today we will have a presentation on the proposed FY23 budget and proposed capital improvement plan. On August 9, we will hear from fire, police, and parks recreation and marine. On August 16, we will hear from the Health and Human Services Department as well as public works. On August 23, we will hear from library services, development services, and economic development. \nSPEAKER_01:  In September 6 and September 13 are potential dates that the City Council may adopt the FY 23 budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  There's also these budget oversight committee meeting scheduled throughout the month that will address various topics related to the proposed budget and the city's finances. Anyone from the budget? \nSPEAKER_01:  Anyone from the public can participate in these as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  in addition to the early community engagement. \nSPEAKER_01:  community meetings. There are three additional virtual meetings scheduled in August for the community to provide feedback on the FY 23 budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Meeting interpretation will be made available in Spanish, Kamae, and Tagalog. The meeting dates and times are listed on this slide. \nSPEAKER_01:  This year we have included a digital comment card into the city's outreach efforts. The purpose of this digital comment card is to provide an opportunity for the community to give additional feedback on the January comm- \nSPEAKER_01:  on the January community engagement results as well as the proposed FY23 budget now that it has been developed. The comment car consists of three questions and an additional optional section to provide demographic information and this will close on August 24, 2022 at 5pm. The summary of comments will be issued to the City Council through a memo before budget adoption. \nSPEAKER_01:  We have a variety of resources available to the public who are interested in engaging in the budget process. Information about all our meetings can be found online at the FY23 budget page, which is loanbeach.gov for slash FY23. A flyer inviting the community to our meetings and to participate in the budget survey has been created and translated into Spanish, Kamae and Tagala. We will distribute the flyer through the citywide community communicators for publication and department newsletters, social media channels, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The events have been promoted on the citywide events calendar and through the neighborhood resource centers, lift serves and print it copies will be available at each of the libraries. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_01:  Also available on the city's budget page is the budget 101 video. \nSPEAKER_01:  The video gives an overview of the basic budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the budget basics such as our city's fawns and funding sources. \nSPEAKER_01:  All of this information, including every chapter of the budget book, such as the City Manager's budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  Message, budgets by department, fund summaries, and other attachments is available online. The city's Public Affairs team is also utilizing social media to promote this and all of the opportunities for engagement, engagement, reference, and this presentation. \nSPEAKER_01:  Additional information is available at lowembeach.gov for a sliced budget. That concludes our presentation and we are available for any questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, wonderful. Thank you for the excellent presentation, great overview. Particularly of the community engagement component. Glad we started this process. \nSPEAKER_01:  wonderful. \nSPEAKER_06:  earlier than we normally do in a hopeful that that early \nSPEAKER_06:  engagement with our public will make for us smoother. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_06:  process this \nSPEAKER_06:  This is this year, this is this year. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'll be. \nSPEAKER_06:  Any questions and comments from my colleagues? \nSPEAKER_06:  Go to the vice chair. \nSPEAKER_05:  Number Urogas. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you, Chair Austin. \nSPEAKER_05:  Just a question in regards to the surveys and those that were already accepted. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is there a demographic breakdown as to where the service came from? \nSPEAKER_05:  in regards to not only \nSPEAKER_05:  We're in the city but also breakdowns in terms of \nSPEAKER_05:  ages, the cities, those types of breakdowns. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, thank you for that question and committee member. We do have a breakdown of those demographics. A detailed list of that is in the May 3rd, Mimal. But I can also give you an overview of that. If that would be helpful of the budget priority survey demographics. And so we included in the demographic survey, we did ask for the response, the respondents, to indicate with council district they were that they currently live in. And for an example of that of the 674 total respondents, 47 of those were in council district one, 82 council district two, 210 council district three, 90 council district four, 105 council district five, 26 council district six, 25 council district seven, 35 council district eight, and 19 council district nine. And we did have 32 that did not know in three non residential respondents. And 49 did skip that particular question. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay, so I was to meet like we have an issue with some of the districts we had very \nSPEAKER_05:  little turn up. \nSPEAKER_05:  6, 7, 9. \nSPEAKER_05:  with the cherry. \nSPEAKER_05:  The response was very low. \nSPEAKER_05:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_05:  Is there any input in terms of what \nSPEAKER_05:  efforts we put out there. I know a lot of times what happens with the \nSPEAKER_05:  in my area, West Long Beach, I mean, it's isolated. \nSPEAKER_05:  And people basically don't realize that it's a whole big community in and of itself. Although it's cut off by the river and the freeway. \nSPEAKER_05:  There's about 25,000 people out in that area and to have only 24 or 25 people respond. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think is bomb-able. We need to do more efforts. \nSPEAKER_05:  in those areas especially looking at district 6. \nSPEAKER_05:  and District 9 as well, so we need to improve those areas. \nSPEAKER_05:  Overall, the number is not impressive, I mean, very often. \nSPEAKER_00:  overall. \nSPEAKER_05:  a city of 400 \nSPEAKER_05:  80,000 people and we only have 600 so \nSPEAKER_05:  respond to the survey, I think doesn't speak very well in terms of our efforts out there. \nSPEAKER_05:  We need to improve on that. \nSPEAKER_05:  And hopefully we can get the word out more that these budget hearings are coming up now. We have a date out there. \nSPEAKER_05:  We need to get the, the advertising out there in terms of what's going on so that people can be more aware of what's. \nSPEAKER_05:  what's going on with our budget for the city of Long Beach. It's very important, obviously. \nSPEAKER_05:  very important items are coming down the pike and it's next budget \nSPEAKER_05:  that they should be well aware of. \nSPEAKER_05:  and that's what I have, uh, chair hosted. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you, and... \nSPEAKER_06:  I tend to agree. I mean, those numbers are a little disturbing. The whole idea behind the early engagement was to engage more residents. I'm curious to know how. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, well. \nSPEAKER_06:  Dium. \nSPEAKER_06:  The shifts in the redistricting impacted those numbers. \nSPEAKER_06:  They were, we were. \nSPEAKER_06:  under the districts. \nSPEAKER_06:  A few months ago, if those numbers would have been differently or changed in any way, but clearly some areas of the city, you know, we do need to \nSPEAKER_06:  step-up engagement and I think \nSPEAKER_06:  this process that we have today. I mean, obviously, \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, some of our council offices can... \nSPEAKER_06:  I'll take the lead and \nSPEAKER_06:  and be, um, \nSPEAKER_06:  to help facilitate engagement, particularly around these government. This FY23 budget. \nSPEAKER_06:  with the tools that we have to work with today. \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, some of the surveys, the video. \nSPEAKER_06:  um, XYZ I know I will be. \nSPEAKER_06:  doing all we can and engage our residents in my district to ensure that we get, you know, robust input for FY23. \nSPEAKER_06:  a consumable price. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Chair Austin. Yeah, I agree with both of my colleagues. Obviously the survey is a really big deal to me. It's something that I advocated for before we did the first survey. \nSPEAKER_04:  I think it's really important that we do a survey. In our council office, we do blast the survey out multiple times through an email blast. And we do talk about it at every community meeting. So we have 21. \nSPEAKER_00:  in our \nSPEAKER_04:  community associations and when are with either myself or council representative attends those we talk about the survey and focus people's attention to it. \nSPEAKER_04:  but still, Councilman Orohnga is correct in a city of \nSPEAKER_04:  almost a half a million people to have 674 total survey responses. I mean it's kind of silly for us to be talking about high response rate in one district versus another when that number is 200. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  being the highest that's still really, really low. \nSPEAKER_04:  So whatever we can do to increase \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, responses by residents. And then I did attend, I tried to attend all of our budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  meetings, our community budget meetings. I try to do that every year as a number of VOC. I try to go to as many of them as I can. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I'm just curious what were our numbers at the actual community meetings. I know they were virtual. \nSPEAKER_04:  or hybrid at least. I can't remember if they were all virtual, but what was the turnout at those meetings and and did we do any sort of assessment to say is it same people going to all the different community meetings sharing the same priorities or did we have \nSPEAKER_04:  a lot of new residents showing up at different community meetings so we track that data at all. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, just councilmember, thank you for that question. So the total number was 141 conducive of both of those virtual community meetings. And we were able to track those, so we were able to track those names. And so that there were no duplicates in that number. So it is conducive of 141 for both of those. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great, thank you. I have another question, and I thank you for the presentation. It was really good. \nSPEAKER_06:  So just my final comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think I'll. \nSPEAKER_06:  Council Member, you're on good bottom. So some good points as well as, I mean, I think we're all concerned about them. \nSPEAKER_06:  the feedback and committee engagement. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there a link? Can you send each member of the BLC? \nSPEAKER_06:  I think the entire City Council, I will just ask the staff send a link. \nSPEAKER_06:  to the um \nSPEAKER_06:  to the engagement. What are we calling it? \nSPEAKER_06:  Digital Comic Card. \nSPEAKER_06:  I love you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I mean, I think that helps. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is that, uh, uh, would there be some context provided? \nSPEAKER_06:  so that individuals can fill out and participate with that comment bar. \nSPEAKER_06:  Because that's your question for staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, sure, Austin. That is correct. The digital comment card, it is digital and it does have a small blurb in there that explains exactly what the digital comment card is. And we can't send that to all of the council members offices for distribution as well. And it is also available on the FY 23 budget website. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's great. I just want to make sure that we are. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's great. \nSPEAKER_06:  We're pushing it in information to to \nSPEAKER_06:  The council members that it's readily available on all city \nSPEAKER_06:  platforms and that we request that folks use this on their social media and their \nSPEAKER_06:  There are their newsletters to get the information out. I think it's very important. And I'd like to see those numbers go up through the course of the next few weeks. \nSPEAKER_06:  So with that, is there a motion to accept? \nSPEAKER_06:  So. \nSPEAKER_06:  report. \nSPEAKER_04:  Summit. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  They've moved their seconded. Is there any public comment on? \nSPEAKER_06:  the report that I'm just sorry about engagement. \nSPEAKER_02:  If there are any members of the public that wish to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature or if you're calling in by phone, please press star 9 now. \nSPEAKER_02:  No public comment, Jair. \nSPEAKER_06:  No further comment. Let's go to a vote. \nSPEAKER_06:  All those in favor, please stay eye. \nSPEAKER_04:  I \nSPEAKER_06:  I-I-I \nSPEAKER_06:  See you later, miss. \nSPEAKER_06:  Motion carried. \nSPEAKER_04:  Motion carries."

We have Meredith Reynolds, our Deputy City Manager for the Long Beach Recovery Act here to provide this presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you, Grace. \nSPEAKER_04:  Good afternoon, Chair Austin and members of the Budget Oversight Committee. In today's presentation, I will briefly revisit the history of the Long Beach Recovery Act. I will cover information about funding categories and equity and collective impact goals. \nSPEAKER_04:  I will discuss staffing and procurement and how the city's equity hiring goals are built into this work. I will review recovery program implementation and share some program highlights. And finally, I will cover how the city's Recovery Act website, Data Dashboard, and the enhanced outreach and communication efforts are underway. \nSPEAKER_04:  Signed into law on March 11th, 2021, the American Rescue Plan provides 350 billion in additional funding for state and local governments to address the public health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly thereafter, on March 16th, 2021, ahead of most other cities in the country, the Long Beach City Council approved the Long Beach Recovery Act, a plan inclusive of federal, state, and county recovery-related funding to address the public health and economic impacts and disparities of the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_04:  The purpose of these recovery-related funding sources was to provide programs and interventions intended to address immediate needs, along with more long-term approaches that strategically and equitably invest in economic recovery for those hardest hit by the pandemic through December of 2024. \nSPEAKER_04:  Priorities included in the Council adopted a recovery act were based on the community's feedback collected during five economic equity studies, and the feedback from over 30 listening sessions with over 350 community leaders and representatives. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Long Beach Recovery Act is made up of over 80 programs organized into three categories, including economic recovery, healthy and safe community, and securing our city's future. \nSPEAKER_04:  These funding categories are grounded in a strategic and equitable recovery, and mutually reinforcing programs are intended to result in collective impact. As we know, the economic impacts of the pandemic have been unequal and have impacted specific sectors, business owners, workers, property owners, nonprofit organizations, geographic areas, and racial groups differently. \nSPEAKER_04:  As the effects of the pandemic have resulted in greater health and economic impacts to some communities more than others, the Recovery Plan utilizes an equity lens to identify the needs of different communities and includes funding for specific programs, outreach, language access, and digital access to ensure the Recovery Plan will assist those most vulnerable and hardest hit by the pandemic throughout Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_04:  The first program area of the Long Beach Recovery Act is economic recovery with a total investment of 64.5 million. \nSPEAKER_04:  This program area focuses resources on residents, businesses most impacted by the pandemic, and on relaunching business sector's hardest hit to promote recovery that strengthens revenue generation and leverages consumer spending to simulate economic growth. \nSPEAKER_04:  The second program area is Healthy and Safe Community, which invests a total of 131 million. \nSPEAKER_04:  This category focuses resources on addressing the underlying social determinants of health and prioritizing basic needs and the mental and physical health of community members most adversely impacted by the pandemic. \nSPEAKER_04:  The third program area is securing our city's future, which is funded at 75.7 million. This funding is maintaining and providing city services that otherwise would not likely have been able to be maintained due to budgetary shortfalls in FY21, FY22, and the proposed budget year of FY23. \nSPEAKER_04:  This funding is also critical in helping the city to be able to weather the next financial crisis by effectively allowing for the restoration of depleted emergency and operating reserves. \nSPEAKER_04:  And finally, the funding provides critical time for the city to develop strategies for the future to address projected significant operating budget shortfalls in future fiscal years. \nSPEAKER_04:  These programs are all made possible by numerous recovery related resources shown on your screen. \nSPEAKER_04:  While initially the city recovery efforts had total just over 235 million staff have continued to secure an additional 35 million recovery funding from numerous sources. \nSPEAKER_04:  As of today, the city's recovery efforts are funded at a total just over 270 million, and the city continues to seek federal, state, and county funding to support and expand the city's recovery work. \nSPEAKER_04:  100% of the 270 million in recovery funding is at your mark and goes directly to fund the recovery programs and services approved by the City Council under the Long Beach Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  The work associated with this amount of funding under the city's recovery effort is a huge lift. \nSPEAKER_04:  Much of this work is what many don't see. So I will first highlight some of the internal work needed to get such an effort off the ground quickly and pave the way for equitable, accessible, and useful recovery programs and services. \nSPEAKER_04:  It is important to recognize that the amount of funding under the Long Beach Recovery Act is larger than the entire budget of many California cities. And the city's current staffing model was insufficient to implement recovery programs on top of staff's current jobs and ongoing pandemic response. \nSPEAKER_04:  A key component to ensuring recovery programs are developed, implemented, and funded, funding dispersed with an eye for equity and collective impact, is strategically hiring a talented staff team who are focused on the Long Beach Recovery Act effort. \nSPEAKER_04:  The city has initiated a three year temporary staffing plan focused on retaining the necessary human resources, setting up financial controls and developing collective impact programs to support recovery. You can see a few examples of those positions on your screen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Initially, this three-year temporary staffing plan included approval of 163 possible positions, including both full-time and part-time positions across 11 city departments. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just about half of these positions have been filled, and other positions continue their recruitment as programs are developed. \nSPEAKER_04:  As talented as citywide recovery staff are, they are also diverse and reflective of the Long Beach community. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here you can see the gender and ratelessness at race and ethnicity demographics of the Long Beach Recovery Staff is compared with the citywide demographics. \nSPEAKER_04:  This diversity helps our city develop important recovery programs that make a difference for our community and is another way we continue to incorporate and equity lens into this important recovery work. \nSPEAKER_04:  Many of these staff are also local residents who have knowledge of their neighborhoods, their community, and are active participants in city life. \nSPEAKER_04:  Additionally, many of staff have internal experience and know how to navigate city process to more effectively deliver recovery programs. So funds are dispersed swiftly, appropriately, and programs are in compliance with federal requirements. \nSPEAKER_04:  Many staff have stepped up into new roles and new team members have joined the recovery effort, creating strong succession planning for the city's many roles and vacancies. \nSPEAKER_04:  Another important part of the Long Beach Recovery effort is to implement equitable procurement strategies so that funds are invested in local service providers and community-based organizations who are trusted partners that can strengthen the reach and impact of recovery programs. \nSPEAKER_04:  To date, the city has released 14 contract opportunities for these groups to do business with the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  nine of these contracts have been awarded with others in progress. \nSPEAKER_04:  One solicitation is currently open and additional contracting opportunities will become available in the coming months. All of this information is through the city's new procurement system Long Beach Bies, which is made possible by partial funding from the Long Beach Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Recovery Act website also provides a forecast of future procurement opportunities for potential vendors and groups to do business with the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  This procurement forecast is an important tool that provides a greater level of information and transparency so that local service providers and community-based organizations can prepare well in advance of any posted procurement opportunity. \nSPEAKER_04:  In past presentations, the City Council has heard about the city's efforts to streamline the city's procurement process, remove barriers and increase transparency, and create additional opportunities for women-owned, minority-owned, and other small local businesses to do business with the city. \nSPEAKER_04:  Much has been learned through the city's extreme procurement makeover effort led by our financial management department that has been helpful in setting up equitable procurement standards for contracting under the Long Beach Recovery Act, which has provided a unique opportunity to test outreach approaches and measure the impact of these strategies to increase equity in procurement. \nSPEAKER_03:  is bad. \nSPEAKER_03:  This is only natural. \nSPEAKER_04:  The chart on the left shows a percent of procurements with more than three bitters and the chart on the right shows better participation by women, minority and local business enterprises. \nSPEAKER_03:  and attention back to the next to the next please attention to the next to the next to the \nSPEAKER_04:  There are these are important metrics as they indicate a decrease in barriers to accessing contract opportunities and a higher level of competition resulting in reduced cost for the city, which means our resources go farther. \nSPEAKER_04:  This can also indicate an increase in contracting with the groups historically not engaged with doing business with the city and can lead to increasing local capacity and entrepreneurial strength, investing in local businesses and building generational wealth by these groups, which are all a part of the city's economic development goals. \nSPEAKER_04:  Amassing multiple sources of funding to invest in Long Beach's recovery, establishing a skilled and diverse workforce, and setting up equitable procurement mechanisms to engage vendors, sets up a strong backbone to implement the Council-adopted recovery programs. \nSPEAKER_04:  77 of these programs have been developed to invest in recovery of those hardest hit by the pandemic, and over 50 percent of the recovery program's budget has been expended to date. \nSPEAKER_04:  Being intentional about the impacts the Long Beach Recovery Act programs have on those who need it most takes time, but means that these programs have the greatest opportunity to serve and provide for those struggling as a result of the pandemic, which amplifies the impacts on Long Beach's communities of color and vulnerable populations. \nSPEAKER_04:  From the beginning, the Long Beach Recovery Act effort, there has been a strong focus on being strategic so that program outcomes are equitably and mutually reinforcing for collective impact. \nSPEAKER_04:  To do this effectively, programs need to be informed by those impacted. Clear metrics need to be identified. Barriers need to be removed to maximize opportunities for participation. And partnerships with trusted community partners and business stakeholders need to be leveraged. \nSPEAKER_04:  This means that programs will roll out over time, some more swiftly and more immediate, and some that will take a little bit longer. \nSPEAKER_04:  I will now highlight a few of these live programs in the following slides. \nSPEAKER_04:  First, we have our emergency rental assistance program, which opened applications in April of 2021. This program assists landlords and income eligible tenants who have experienced financial loss or hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic through rental assistance. \nSPEAKER_04:  This program helps income eligible tenants pay rent in utilities, both for past due bills and future payments and prioritizes assisting lower income tenants who have been unemployed for 90 days or more or who at risk of housing instability. \nSPEAKER_04:  You can see the statistics of this program here on the slide. \nSPEAKER_04:  Next is the Restaurant Brewery and Bar Relief, Direct Relief Grant Program, which provides direct financial relief through a one-time payment to small, long-beach food and beverage businesses to assist with pandemic impacts. \nSPEAKER_04:  eligible businesses can receive between 5,000 and 25,000 to support their business and grants awarded in tiers, with a tiered award amount based on the gross annual revenue provided by applicants. \nSPEAKER_04:  You can see the program statistics here on your screen. \nSPEAKER_04:  The next program is the Personal Services and Fitness Direct Relief Grant Program, which provides direct relief through one time payments to small, on beach personal services and fitness businesses to assist with pandemic impacts. Similarly, eligible businesses can receive between 5,000 and 25,000, and grants are awarded in tears with a tiered award amount based on the gross annual revenue provided by applicants. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here you can see the program statistics on your screen. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Small Business Relief Grant provides direct financial relief for one time payment to small long-beach businesses that are not otherwise eligible for the restaurant brewery in Bar Relief Grant or the personal services and fitness relief grant. \nSPEAKER_04:  Similarly, these eligible businesses can receive between 2500 and 10,000 to support their business and grants are awarded in tiers with a tiered award amount based on the Groves Annual Revenue provided by applicants. \nSPEAKER_04:  You can see the program statistics here on your screen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here we have the nonprofit relief grant, which provides direct relief grants up to 25,000 to help existing Long Beach nonprofit organizations on pandemic impacts, including retiring debt, paying fixed costs and utilities, paying rent, covering payroll, purchasing furniture, fixtures, or equipment, and pay for other related expenses required to operate the nonprofit. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here you can see the program statistics on your screen. \nSPEAKER_04:  And for our last highlight here today is the Long Beach Resource Line. \nSPEAKER_04:  This phone number is a hotline for residents to call and connect with knowledgeable health department staff who can provide accurate referrals to local services such as health care, mental health care, food access, housing, and shelter and legal aid. \nSPEAKER_04:  City staff utilize a referral platform which was launched in January of 2021. \nSPEAKER_04:  to create a closed loop referral system between agencies in the community. And many agencies have joined this referral platform in Long Beach to create what we call a no wrong door entry service system. \nSPEAKER_04:  Residents can also access this electronic request form to connect with resource line staff after hours. And residents who are interested in looking for resources at their own convenience are able to search a public-facing website in database. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here on your screen you can see the most requested resources or the referrals that have come to the slide in addition to the program statistics. \nSPEAKER_04:  The city has updated the Long Beach Recovery website, which is where all Long Beach Recovery Act information is available to the public. At LongBeach.gov-4-Recovery. \nSPEAKER_04:  Since the initial launch, the Recovery website has been updated with information pertaining to future contracting opportunities, recovery programs, economic opportunities for residents, businesses, and local community-based organizations. \nSPEAKER_04:  Included on this website is the Reporting and Data Dashboard. This is where all of our program statistics live. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here you see an image from the city's recovery act data dashboard, which depicts the progress and status of recovery expenditures and program implementation. It also highlights economic recovery and healthy and safe community programs and captures the stories from those who have benefited from recovery investments. Here you can see just a few examples of those stories from folks who have participated in the older adult food and meal delivery program, the personal services relief grant, the older adult case management program, and the Parks Child Care Program. \nSPEAKER_04:  This dashboard will be updated quarterly as program data is collected and reported as programs go live. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Recovery Act website and dashboard are just one part of a larger outreach and communications approach. To get the word out to the public, vendors, businesses, and those who benefit directly from these programs, as well as our efforts to keep City Council and the public connected to the city's process. \nSPEAKER_04:  We characterize this as two waves of outreach. The first wave announces when programs or contracting opportunities will be available in the future. So applicants have time to prepare. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the second wave announces when a programmer contracting opportunity has gone live. So people know it is now available and open for application. \nSPEAKER_04:  The city's two wave outreach efforts have included robust communication methods across multiple media platforms and have included direct messaging to affected groups or potential applicants in the city's multiple languages. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have published over 150 posts on the official City Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram pages. And the statistics indicating we have over 400,000 impressions, 9,000 engagements, 960 post-click link clicks, which would indicate that people have access to that resource. \nSPEAKER_04:  Not including the reach of these posts from the city's website, we are also exponentially connected through department social media accounts who reshare the social media posts on their own pages. \nSPEAKER_04:  and recovery content is also shared on City Newsletter. For example, the Go Long Beach City newsletter has almost 60,000 subscribers, and that's in addition to the City's equity newsletter, economic development newsletter, and more. \nSPEAKER_04:  We also provide. \nSPEAKER_04:  for each of these a more direct approach depending on the program. \nSPEAKER_04:  For instance, for contracting opportunities on average, 67 direct phone calls are made by our procurement staff to advertise and to provide interest on procurement opportunities. \nSPEAKER_04:  A few other examples, for instance, the Health Equity RFP. There were 160 direct calls to potential applicants in organizational contacts. And there were 114 prospective bidders that then reviewed the RFP and 62 organizations that submitted proposals. \nSPEAKER_04:  For the economy grants, there was direct outreach through community-based organizations and the economic development business liaisons and the inclusive business navigators and our BizCare team. With over 1,061 businesses who received direct outreach and in addition, four webinars were conducted by economic development staff. \nSPEAKER_04:  Economic, excuse me, economy grant applications were also shared on the city's main social media page along with the extended reach of our community-based organization partners through social media, email, newsletters, the events provided by the community-based organizations and the Economic Development Newsletter with over 3,000 business subscribers. \nSPEAKER_04:  Here are just a few examples of the over 150 multilingual media recovery outreach posts that were placed on the city's social media. \nSPEAKER_04:  And finally, the Recovery Act website is a transparent repository for all reporting and associated documents related to the Long Beach Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  This includes city status reports which are produced by annually, US Department Treasury reports which are produced annually, and any other periodic city council correspondence related to the Recovery Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  As I conclude today's presentation, I would like to recognize the City staff collaborative who are partnering to make these programs possible, many of whose efforts are highlighted in today's report. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would also like to recognize the many community-based organizations, business and industry groups, educational partners and nonprofits who have stepped up to provide service, and partner with the city to expand our reach of the Funded Recovery Programs throughout our community. \nSPEAKER_04:  This concludes staff's presentation and I along with several colleagues representing our recovery programs are available to answer any questions. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Well, I'd like to give you an applause, great job, great excellent report. \nSPEAKER_01:  A lot of great information and a lot of love. \nSPEAKER_01:  quality services are happening in our city as result of \nSPEAKER_01:  this recovery act. I'm glad that our city is distinguished. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Senator. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  I think he said it best, I mean, we... \nSPEAKER_01:  This will come react to the budget. \nSPEAKER_01:  0171. \nSPEAKER_01:  $200 is everyone million is larger than. \nSPEAKER_01:  the budgets of most California cities and this is \nSPEAKER_01:  something that we are doing to supplement our general fund. \nSPEAKER_01:  but also to serve our residents. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll just say that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, I did have questions regarding tip three, your temporary staffing plan in terms of... \nSPEAKER_01:  And maybe these temporary employees and what happens once these will come react dollars are. \nSPEAKER_01:  are exhausted. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  11 city departments and there's a number of positions, 163 positions. Do we have we thought that through yet? \nSPEAKER_04:  Hi, Chair Austin. Yes, we have. And part of the \nSPEAKER_04:  Internal work is for a transition and off-boarding plan for those employees. So right now we are currently working with our civil service staff and our human resources staff to identify existing vacancies that could be possible to be filled by these highly skilled folks as well as the opportunity for career mapping, resume and interview skills training, and being able to successfully have folks transition into some of our current city vacancies where we have some priority projects. We will be managing this process over the balance of this year. It will be a little bit early before any transition needs to happen, so everyone has those skills and has a sense of where they could possibly fit in into the future. So there's more work needed here, but we have started that process and we will continue that with the support for the staff to hopefully find a spot with our city where their skills match the need in these departments. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll see you next time. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  That's refreshing to hear because I want to make sure that the city along beaches are \nSPEAKER_01:  is a desirable place to work and people. \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, we'll come here to share their talents and help us, you know, some of our residents are in a place to feel like they have an opportunity for a career here as well. So \nSPEAKER_01:  Uh \nSPEAKER_01:  I want to just say that I'm really impressed with all of the \nSPEAKER_01:  outreach strategies that your team has deployed. \nSPEAKER_01:  America, particularly the direct emails and \nSPEAKER_01:  phone calls to potential applicants that shows that we are doing. \nSPEAKER_01:  outreach and taking the work seriously and really \nSPEAKER_01:  pushing to move these important funds in throughout our community. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  And then the dashboard and just all of \nSPEAKER_01:  By all accounts, this is... \nSPEAKER_01:  excellent transparency and and uh, accountability as well. There should be any question about \nSPEAKER_01:  Where the funds are going, how they're spending, these applying for them, who our community partners are. I think it's all laid out for us very, very clear. I'm sure that there are areas that we could all \nSPEAKER_01:  think of to improve. \nSPEAKER_01:  But by all stretches, I mean... \nSPEAKER_01:  to have \nSPEAKER_01:  the timeline in place. \nSPEAKER_01:  to receive these funds and to move these funds and to \nSPEAKER_01:  So it's an execute. I think we're going. \nSPEAKER_01:  very well. Those are just my comments. I would like to \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll open it up for my colleagues. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm a council member, you're on, or a council member, prize at our end up. \nSPEAKER_03:  I put my literal hand up as opposed to my virtual hand. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  Merit, the fantastic presentation that was really thorough. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I actually learned quite a bit watching. \nSPEAKER_03:  watching the slides. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I will say I wear a couple of different hats in the city. Obviously this information that you provided has come to us in one form or another on the council. \nSPEAKER_03:  but also I'm a small business owner and I sit on a couple of nonprofit boards in the city and I will say that the information regarding grant opportunities has come to me \nSPEAKER_03:  in each of those hats, wearing these for those hats. So the communication is good. It's getting to, \nSPEAKER_03:  the attended targets. \nSPEAKER_03:  I try a lot of times to take my council hat off. \nSPEAKER_03:  and put my citizen business. \nSPEAKER_03:  owner, you know, nonprofit board member. \nSPEAKER_03:  whatever had on to see if the communication is good and I will say. \nSPEAKER_00:  Good. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, it started off with us really as a city trying to figure it out. But by the latest grants that went out, grant opportunities that went out, I thought the communication system was much better. \nSPEAKER_03:  you know, solidified. So who does to you and your team for that? \nSPEAKER_03:  I do have a question regarding the emergency rental assistance grants. \nSPEAKER_03:  The 55.9 million distributed. \nSPEAKER_03:  Are those the grants, are those the only source of \nSPEAKER_03:  rental reimbursement grants."
