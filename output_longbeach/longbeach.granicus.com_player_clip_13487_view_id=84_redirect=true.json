        "transcript": "SPEAKER_09:  with recommended changes to the draft vendor code. At our last meeting, it was agreed that we would each individually \nSPEAKER_09:  look at the draft vendor code, give comments on what we thought were possible changes areas that we thought needed to be tweaked or just a little bit enhanced. Send those to staff by January 4th. They would compile everything. They've sent us a copy of everything that they've received so that we could go through the comments. What I'd like to do to kind of facilitate this discussion is move through the commissioners one by one for you to provide your feedback and your comments. There were a lot of great variety of comments. And I think in order to still it, we can kind of go through the documents and say, yay or nay, if you like things, but I think at the end of the day what might work best after we've heard things that people liked or they didn't like is to then ask two members or three of the commission to form a small ad hoc in one month kind of go through and merge everything together. If that's agreeable to the group then we'll just kind of proceed in that manner. \nSPEAKER_09:  I see a few heads nodding. So Commissioner, do you been addicted since you're taking a drink of water? You want to start? \nSPEAKER_02:  Well, that's there. OK, let's see. Need to go back and look at what I've done. Thank you. I think that's a great idea. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm lying, I'm looking ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  I wish there were no evs. Okay. I might have been \nSPEAKER_02:  My thoughts might have been to just in terms of structure. I made some comments that I that seem to appear in other parts of the \nSPEAKER_02:  Code of Conduct. I did want to make a comment on the term of vendor, but if that is the terminology that is commonly used in the city I think that's something we should adopt or stay with. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, \nSPEAKER_02:  I will say some \nSPEAKER_02:  both at the state and the federal level. They tend to turn towards either contractor or supplier, but I'll defer to the experts on who and how we coin \nSPEAKER_02:  contingent labor and other types of parties. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  for some reason. \nSPEAKER_02:  We were harshly criticized for using the term vendor that made them think of platforms they used to say. \nSPEAKER_02:  But, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  I thought it was very important to talk about the uh \nSPEAKER_02:  preserving the public trust also speaking to compliance with law I know that that's repeated later. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Dave Bendictus, we lost your audio for a moment, so give us one second. \nSPEAKER_02:  adherence to law up in the in the purpose in addition to practices and policy. Some suppliers have very mature. Congratulations. \nSPEAKER_03:  stopping the song in the parking \uc5b4\ub824this \nSPEAKER_02:  I can hear you all. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, we lost you for a second. Do you, maybe about the last 45 seconds or so? Would you mind just kind of repeating those points, sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  It was from the Hot Dog joke. \nSPEAKER_03:  after the hard dog joke. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. The importance of mentioning adherence to law and regulation. \nSPEAKER_02:  is probably I know that it's mentioned later, but I think it's important that we mention it throughout. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, that standards of conduct. \nSPEAKER_02:  Some suppliers have very mature programs already. \nSPEAKER_02:  and that we would want them to adopt ours if they don't already have one that mirrors or is aligned with the cities. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we speak to assessing their compliance with code. I think that we should discuss more about who that would be that assesses. \nSPEAKER_02:  if it is our \nSPEAKER_02:  procurement function or if it is somebody who might be closer to codes of conduct or compliance standards. I'm not sure who that might be. \nSPEAKER_02:  But if we say that we will assess, we should identify who assesses. \nSPEAKER_09:  If you pause for one second, maybe the staff can fill in right now who traditionally does the assessment. \nSPEAKER_08:  It would be the staff assigned to the contract that has more intimate knowledge and works directly with the vendor that would be noting compliance versus non-compliance. \nSPEAKER_09:  So the city does have contract monitors that would take that on as part of the regular duty. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, and we already have, each of the departments has a person who or people who are managing the contract already like the chair said. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, is it like a contract technical manager or somebody who's familiar with \nSPEAKER_02:  The standards. \nSPEAKER_08:  It depends on which department. Sometimes it's the program manager, sometimes depending on the size of the department. It can be a single individual. Like in my department, we don't have a ton of contracts, so we have one person that's managing contracts, whereas the health department has a robust amount of programs. Each of the staff members managing the program would be the contract, would be monitoring contract compliance. Or the team assigned to the contract. \nSPEAKER_09:  but they've been trained on the components of the contract so they know what the standards are they're monitoring too. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yes, all staff, they should be aware of the contracts that they're monitoring. They have a responsibility to read them and understand. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um. \nSPEAKER_08:  what needs to be done under the contract. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, thank you. I think that it's important to identify who is assessing and just as what you said, if at least the standards are centralized, that's important. Something I wouldn't be as familiar with. \nSPEAKER_02:  See. \nSPEAKER_02:  The ARs we keep coming back to the ARs and I was happy to see that the City Manager spoke to the role of the ethics commission in influencing \nSPEAKER_02:  and helping develop policy. \nSPEAKER_02:  where we, it speaks to AR-82. \nSPEAKER_02:  8-2 it might be good to take a look at that I'd like to participate in that if possible with with respect to gratis I know that we speak a lot to tickets but there's so many more things that maybe we can expand a little more there. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think most of my comments. \nSPEAKER_02:  or \nSPEAKER_02:  Self-explanatory. I do know that there are some new requirements in California with respect to whistle blowing human trafficking Title 9. \nSPEAKER_02:  We would want to make sure that we do a good sweep on that. \nSPEAKER_02:  I mentioned and I think I share this in a companion. \nSPEAKER_02:  documents were to \nSPEAKER_02:  to staff and that is we also need to make sure that this code speaks to both the employees role, the city's role. \nSPEAKER_02:  with and the suppliers role that \nSPEAKER_02:  The document should. \nSPEAKER_02:  contemplate the behaviors of both parties always and if necessary any other companion material. \nSPEAKER_02:  With that, I'll defer to the others. But you've captured. Thank you for putting forward my suggestions. \nSPEAKER_09:  Before you go, Commissioner, to be in a dictus, did you have any concerns with any of the other comments or did they make sense to you also? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, all makes sense. I think we all bring different perspectives and all of them should be. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  considered. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Make sure you shot well. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. So my comments and I kind of said this at the last meeting. I didn't and I apologize because I did not provide written comments but I really am looking for that. I think the draft is very good. I have a couple of questions. I want to make sure that this document is not as a document that would be \nSPEAKER_04:  handed to different representatives of entities that are with the city that are working for the city or available to them and really speak at a high level to them as opposed to getting into specifics about compliance with certain specific types of laws rules or regulations. I believe where we have certain specific types of laws that is those should be embedded in the terms and conditions of the agreements with the vendor. One comment, one question is for staff, is it the intent of city staff that on a going forward basis we will be including \nSPEAKER_04:  And this would be in addition to specific terms that are necessary, but including a general term and all new contracts with the city of reference to and incorporate by reference the vendor code of contact in new contracts. \nSPEAKER_08:  No. \nSPEAKER_08:  This document is aspirational. \nSPEAKER_08:  It is not going to be included in \nSPEAKER_08:  the city contracts in a way that would require compliance as a contract term. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's more of an acknowledgement document than it would be a term of the contract. \nSPEAKER_04:  So vendors don't, if they don't have some other obligation to comply, they don't necessarily need to comply with this document. Have face any consequences from the city if they don't comply. \nSPEAKER_08:  Correct, but... \nSPEAKER_08:  With that, the majority of the items in this document that are referenced are already \nSPEAKER_08:  legal requirements. So there is a consequence of not complying with the law whether \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's enforced under the contract or not. It would depend on the facts of the situation, that by not complying with the vendor code. \nSPEAKER_08:  They still risk the relationship that the vendor has with the city and whether the city is going to continue to work with that vendor. I would assume \nSPEAKER_08:  Based on my experience, typically if we have that kind of an issue with a vendor, that's not the only issue that we have with a vendor. Those types of vendors typically are also not complying with deliverables. We have invoicing problems. There's other issues with that vendor beyond the fact that they're not complying with these types of requirements. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so my next question I think then is probably obvious because I was going to ask if there was anything in the vendor code of conduct or should it be that \nSPEAKER_04:  We would, the city does not intend to interfere with a vendor's option to report any misconduct on part of the city to, beyond the city, to any federal or state authority as appropriate. It's along the lines of what I'm used to seeing a lot of times in codes and vendor codes of conduct is that we're not going to stand in the way of you talking with government officials. Now, because this is not a requirement that would be incorporated into the, being incorporated by reference in the terms and conditions of contracts, I don't know if that necessarily is necessary. \nSPEAKER_04:  appropriate. \nSPEAKER_08:  Are you referencing like, lobbying? \nSPEAKER_04:  I was a whistle. So if a vendor sees something happening within the city that's inappropriate, we want them to talk to the city. But there's no reason why they shouldn't be talking to another agency if it's appropriate to talk to that other agency. In most cases, and maybe to your point, Hiller, that might just be limited to the FPPC because other people are not. \nSPEAKER_08:  Incredible\u7dda \nSPEAKER_04:  jurisdictions where we don't have any jurisdiction over the city. And that may be the case. \nSPEAKER_08:  That's a requirement that I could look into and discuss internally of whether it was appropriate to add to our contracts in general. That seems above and beyond. \nSPEAKER_08:  potentially this document where that would be something if the city chose to adopt that term that we would want to have enforceable under the contract but that's not something that I can advise on today without having a further discussion internally. \nSPEAKER_04:  I appreciate that and given the fact that the dedicated conduct is an aspirational document, I don't think it's as necessary as it otherwise would be. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I just have a kind of a question. Speaking that now everyone understands that this is an aspirational document. \nSPEAKER_09:  I heard you saying that you were looking for this to be written at a higher level, not really looking at the nuts and bolts of everything that would have to be complied with. And a lot of the changes that Commissioner D. Benadict has made are further defining some of the compliance issues. \nSPEAKER_09:  So are you in looking at what everyone has submitted? Are you saying you would rather see a document that didn't go that deep into the nuts and bolts? \nSPEAKER_04:  The answer is Genoie Yes, because I'm looking for a document that's read. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  and as with codes of conduct I'm looking for short, something that we have a hope somebody will read. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Now there are certain types of provisions and the types of provisions the Commissioner Dave Vandedictus was talking about some of them that she was talking about gratuitous is just making there. I think it's appropriate to have in basically saying don't give us anything as the city city manager employees are not allowed to accept anything. Something to that effect just making sure it's crystal clear on their part. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  clear. \nSPEAKER_09:  So you're kind of you would pick and choose. There are some areas where you think we're okay. There are others where you think it needs to be, to have a little more depth to it. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm in a minute. \nSPEAKER_04:  And it absolutely, in my opinion, it really goes to the \nSPEAKER_04:  How generally applicable the provisions are to all vendors and employees of the vendors as opposed to getting into some specifics. So for example, if it was very specific about what's required for say lobbyists, then I think there are other documents that are really appropriate for that. Well, and lobbyists, I mean the city doesn't employ lobbyists, so never mind. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  But \nSPEAKER_09:  So \nSPEAKER_09:  Some of that may be covered in the language of the contract. \nSPEAKER_09:  and doesn't need to be covered here is what you're saying. Yes. Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Commissioner Norge? \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you, Chair. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  just by way of introduction, I just \nSPEAKER_00:  I really focused on \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  the protection of the city. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, when I read through the draft, \nSPEAKER_00:  My focus went to the protection of the city as well as protection of city employees. \nSPEAKER_00:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_00:  I just want to say also that I may repeat or duplicate. \nSPEAKER_00:  some information. \nSPEAKER_00:  that may already be \nSPEAKER_00:  covered in contracts that \nSPEAKER_00:  I didn't have access to. \nSPEAKER_00:  and um \nSPEAKER_00:  I just want to add that. \nSPEAKER_00:  I just want the city to be truly \nSPEAKER_00:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_00:  committed to responsible procurement. \nSPEAKER_00:  and expect the vendors to share. \nSPEAKER_00:  the city's sustainability and ethical values. \nSPEAKER_00:  with that said. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  I direct. \nSPEAKER_00:  YouTube paragraph two. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_00:  paragraph two. \nSPEAKER_00:  and after reading that first paragraph, \nSPEAKER_00:  There wasn't anything about protecting \nSPEAKER_00:  providing support. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the complainants or the whistleblowers. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I just need to suggestion that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Complain ends or whistleblowers will be provided with all requisite support. \nSPEAKER_00:  include anonymity and will not be subject to harassment. \nSPEAKER_00:  a retribution. \nSPEAKER_00:  on page two. \nSPEAKER_00:  at the end of that same paragraph. \nSPEAKER_00:  Consider \nSPEAKER_00:  the Adha committee or the commission at the end of this project. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  that vendors will not refer. \nSPEAKER_00:  or use the city logos or materials without the city's prior written. \nSPEAKER_00:  consent or permission. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  So, could we share just one second? Is that in the contract already? Yes, that one's in the contract already. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll be sure to see you in a second. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  But thank you for thinking of that. \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah, that's okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  And I apologize I'm going a little slow because I printed this in black and white. \nSPEAKER_00:  and the copy I transmitted to the office was in color. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  no apologies necessary. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  Page 3. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  paragraph three. \nSPEAKER_00:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_00:  Section E. \nSPEAKER_00:  on page three. \nSPEAKER_00:  asking us to consider or add an paragraph regarding \nSPEAKER_00:  the vendor's compliance with laws and safeguarding confidential. \nSPEAKER_00:  personal and or business information. \nSPEAKER_00:  Paragraph 5. \nSPEAKER_00:  Section subparagraph 4, Section A. \nSPEAKER_00:  in the middle of \nSPEAKER_00:  the pet. \nSPEAKER_00:  towards the end of the paragraph. \nSPEAKER_00:  I suggested that we consider \nSPEAKER_00:  Adiin. \nSPEAKER_00:  vendors will prohibit and will not tolerate physical, mental, verbal, and or any other abuse. \nSPEAKER_00:  and consider adding and \nSPEAKER_00:  Also consider adding something like disciplinary and grievance procedures should be documented and communicated to all employees. \nSPEAKER_00:  I didn't see the word. \nSPEAKER_00:  as a side note, I can see the word or term inclusion. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  in the document. \nSPEAKER_00:  but I know that we have discussed it. \nSPEAKER_00:  \uac70 \nSPEAKER_00:  inclusion. \nSPEAKER_00:  equity and diversity. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  Finally. \nSPEAKER_00:  Parabraph 8. \nSPEAKER_00:  Section 6. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well. \nSPEAKER_00:  I added a six. Sorry. After section five. \nSPEAKER_00:  consider \nSPEAKER_00:  based on the city resources and availability that the city will conduct random compliance checks. \nSPEAKER_00:  If you recall at the December meeting and I apologize, I don't recall staff's name. \nSPEAKER_00:  the individual who responded to my questions regarding compliance checks. \nSPEAKER_00:  She said that they only do so when there's a complaint, but I'm suggesting that the city \nSPEAKER_00:  conduct random compliance checks. \nSPEAKER_00:  With that said, thank you for the opportunity. I hope the notes made sense. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  I see all my colleagues were very, very formal. I just thought we were just... \nSPEAKER_00:  throwing notes at each other. So if you need me to revise it in a more fun way, I'd be happy. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  We all do our own style. No judgments. \nSPEAKER_00:  All right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Any questions for Commissioner Anorley? \nSPEAKER_09:  Vice Chair, will we do commissioner wise? \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  It's a traditional-wise, it's a traditional-wise first. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. I approached this a little bit differently. I looked at all the comments that the other commissioners had submitted. And there were a few that were substance. So I'll comment on those and then speak to what a few of my own suggestions were. To me, Commissioner Anorvay's comments, I really liked the one he just ended with, which is the including or putting everyone on notice that there may be random audits of their compliance with this, this and so they should be prepared for that. So I really endorse that incorporating that and as to Commissioner D. Van A Dictus comments, I especially liked the one about including a specific reference to consultants because there seems to be have been some confusion or \nSPEAKER_07:  They're not getting treated. They really are a sort of vendor to the city in my mind. And so I think calling them out specifically is an important thing. \nSPEAKER_07:  A lot of the comments that I made are more, there's a lot of what I'm going to call editing comments in ways that things can be clarified and \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm always I endorse Commissioner Chatwell's approach which is let's make it as short and clear as possible. I was particularly concerned with the section about tickets and gifts because \nSPEAKER_07:  I think \nSPEAKER_07:  I understand they have to look at that they should be referred to the regulations, but for this document, I think that if the more concise we can be about what the policy is, the better, and I didn't feel that had quite been achieved. \nSPEAKER_07:  I myself didn't take it upon to figure out how to do that and so I'd leave that to the ad hoc or Actually, I even thought of sending all of this to staff and saying come back and incorporate all these ideas and bring it back to us or to the Or to the group that's ultimately responsible for for doing this. So I'll leave it at that \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Anyone have any questions for Commissioner Weiss? Let's check. \nSPEAKER_01:  I did a mark up as I was going through again for clarity and I'm not going to try to review all of those changes. I think in some cases other commissioners have. \nSPEAKER_01:  and my better ways of \nSPEAKER_01:  of wording some of the things. But on a bigger picture basis, the first thing \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm thinking about is... \nSPEAKER_01:  What in what form will this be handed to vendors and all of their employees? \nSPEAKER_01:  And so I'm thinking of some sort of little glossy pamphlet. \nSPEAKER_01:  And so I did suggest changing the format so it was more \nSPEAKER_01:  accessible to all levels of employee of a vendor. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  and there's a lot of different ways we can do that, I suggest in one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um. \nSPEAKER_01:  The second thing which is important and I mentioned in the December meeting, this has to apply \nSPEAKER_01:  across the board. \nSPEAKER_01:  So rather than stating the rule \nSPEAKER_01:  Four. \nSPEAKER_01:  vendors working under the city manager. \nSPEAKER_01:  We say different departments have different rules. You need to know the rules for the department you're dealing with. \nSPEAKER_01:  and then some links would be great. \nSPEAKER_01:  and uh... \nSPEAKER_01:  of \nSPEAKER_01:  particular note, I also added a section called fair competition. I just think when we're talking about ethics with vendors, fair competitions are really important point to always make, that we don't expect them not to \nSPEAKER_01:  Let me expect them to compete fairly and honestly. I just think we ought to make that point. And I agree with the comments. \nSPEAKER_01:  from several of the commissioners before that we need to \nSPEAKER_01:  have audits of compliance in some way and let the vendors know there will be audits of compliance. \nSPEAKER_01:  and have a process in place for that. I think it's a good idea to take all of these. I saw the other commissioners comments and I thought \nSPEAKER_01:  in general. \nSPEAKER_01:  We're not inconsistent. We all made different points. \nSPEAKER_01:  and so it'll be, it'll be... \nSPEAKER_01:  an interesting process to try to melt them. \nSPEAKER_09:  So when you say audits of compliance, are you talking about something separate and distinct from what the staff already does? \nSPEAKER_09:  to ensure compliance with the contract. \nSPEAKER_01:  I don't know because I don't know how extensive that is. So one of the things I was looking at here is \nSPEAKER_01:  if they find fraud-lacer abuse. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are they reporting it? Are they obligated to report it? \nSPEAKER_01:  under the existing contract. \nSPEAKER_09:  The city staff. \nSPEAKER_01:  the vendor, the vine's Broadway store views. \nSPEAKER_09:  Bye bye. \nSPEAKER_09:  within their own organization. \nSPEAKER_01:  within their own organization. \nSPEAKER_01:  are they obligated to report that to city staff? \nSPEAKER_01:  And that is something. \nSPEAKER_01:  and how timely would that report have to be. \nSPEAKER_01:  and that's something that then could be audited. \nSPEAKER_09:  So if I'm... \nSPEAKER_09:  XYZ service provider and I find out that I had a project manager who was tightening funds off of a project. Do I have my obligated under the contract? I'm going to presume that they are because I think most government contracts have that language in them. \nSPEAKER_09:  but Taylor's gonna tell us she's gonna have to go back and look. \nSPEAKER_09:  You're so smart. But I know if it's a federal contract, so if it's something that the health department has done, that is a requirement of the Health and Human Services Agency. \nSPEAKER_08:  That is correct, whether it gets put into all of the contracts, that's something that I'll have to look into, whether it's standard language. I know for the health contracts and the ones that are attached to federal grants, that's automatic. Yep. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  They have strict rules. \nSPEAKER_09:  as you all know who dealt with that contract. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  So \nSPEAKER_09:  How do we move forward? I had no comments going forward. I just wanted to see what everyone else does. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I did agree, and I liked the report. I knew there were going to be other things that you all saw that could be put in it, but I agree with the comment that I think it needs to be from a very high level. \nSPEAKER_09:  and \nSPEAKER_09:  It might be good. \nSPEAKER_09:  Taylor or Heather if however we do this if we have a couple of members working if There is some standard boilerplate that goes into every contract if the group that's doing that can get a copy of that And out note is it available on the city website? \nSPEAKER_09:  the procurement. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I don't know if it's available on the City website. It does go out to the vendors when we do go for RFP. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  It's a public record. It's something I can definitely share. \nSPEAKER_08:  We have a couple different versions, but I can give you the most common ones. I think it would be great. \nSPEAKER_09:  that everything. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think it would be good because I think a lot of the comments that we got back dealt with just not knowing what is already covered in the contract language versus what is here. And I think if whomever is looking at this as a chance to look at that contract language to know what they're required to adhere to under the contract, then I think that makes this easier to just make a more aspirational document. \nSPEAKER_09:  So if you're all comfortable with, yes, Commissioner Shatla. \nSPEAKER_04:  I do have one additional question. I actually... \nSPEAKER_04:  Connecting a couple things. So I liked Commissioner. I think it was a Nerve's comment and when I read it in writing and now I think now I understand that it was his With regard to kind of this audit right? Mm-hmm. My question is that if it is an aspirational document, you know Who's why would there be an audit right and what vendor would consent to such an audit? Given the fact that this isn't incorporated into their terms and conditions \nSPEAKER_09:  But I think that's why I think it's important for whomever is the small work group to look at putting this together. C is exactly what is in that boilerplate language to understand what the language in the contract says about reviews, audits, reports, and everything else. Because I think if there's strong enough language in the contract, I think Commissioner Norvay's concern is going to be addressed. \nSPEAKER_09:  So I would really, I would prefer to see at least two members of the commission work with staff on melding this together. And so I'm looking for two volunteers. \nSPEAKER_09:  rather than fall in telling somebody that \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  You see any hands creeping up? I only need two bodies and three of the bodies that are present. Commissioner D. Benedictus, thank you very much. Commissioner Chotwell, thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you very much. For that, for my comments and advance, I will consent that it be mine. Sure. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, sure. Just for consideration, I remember that Commissioner Feeder mentioned during the last meeting that he was interested in participating. So just to keep that in mind, I don't know if you just want to or three, but he did say that he was interested in the vendor code. But he may be busy. He may not be available. \nSPEAKER_09:  You may not be available, so... \nSPEAKER_09:  He's gonna be a little busy. \nSPEAKER_09:  busier than he thought he was going to be. Okay, so I'm going to make a motion that we receive and file the comments and the changes and that as a full body we seat an ad hoc to work on putting together a final report of commissioners deepened addictus and commissioners shop well. Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  A second. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_05:  At this time, if anyone would like to speak in the Zoom meeting, please use the raise hand feature. \nSPEAKER_06:  Seeing none, that concludes follow comment. \nSPEAKER_09:  Call the vet. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Norvey? \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Day Bendictus. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Feedler? Commissioner Shotwell? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Wise? \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Vice Chair Pauline. \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  ch \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 mali."

        "transcript": "SPEAKER_04:  motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the next item is a recommendation to continue the study session to discuss the October 12, 2022 Memorandum titled Notice of Alleged Violations on the City's ethics policy regarding the conduct of certain council members. And to kind of facilitate our discussion as we move through this item, I'd like to open with a motion for our consideration and then we can give there's a second we can go forward but either way we'll go forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  for the second. \nSPEAKER_06:  I move based on the information provided to the commission and under the commission's limited authority to recommend to the city council that Mayor Richardson and council member Austin are Centered for violating the city's ethics policy and speaking on behalf of the city council without authorization of the city council and Because such communications by candidates in advertising and public service announcements During an election cycle creates the impression that the city supports the council members respective candidacies \nSPEAKER_06:  Would anyone like to second? \nSPEAKER_01:  Chair. Yes. I second I also \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_01:  Also, I will heartedly agree with you in concur. I also... \nSPEAKER_01:  like some of the recommendations offered by Council on \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm losing my spot on speaking to some of the recommendations to clarify. \nSPEAKER_01:  and put in writing. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it was to amend the \nSPEAKER_01:  So make it help me. \nSPEAKER_02:  amend the chapter in the municipal code related to mass mailings and include revision. \nSPEAKER_01:  It's kind of our KX in 1992 that that would be helpful. \nSPEAKER_01:  to avoid this possibly in the future. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you very much. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't need to add that to the motion though, do we? \nSPEAKER_06:  a recommendation that the city update those. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Domenodictus was that your intent to ask for a friendly to \nSPEAKER_02:  Um, and \nSPEAKER_02:  and amendment to \nSPEAKER_02:  two \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  The session is escaping me. \nSPEAKER_01:  the section is \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  That was my intention. \nSPEAKER_01:  That was my intention. In addition to the chairs. \nSPEAKER_01:  recommendation to censure. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  to make to adopt those changes. I think that they're very good. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. So the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  The friendly amendment would be \nSPEAKER_06:  to add and to recommend to the city that it update. \nSPEAKER_06:  the section that Taylor referenced. \nSPEAKER_06:  one. \nSPEAKER_02:  point two. \nSPEAKER_06:  2.6 in the municipal code 1.26 in the municipal code. I'll accept that as a friendly amendment. \nSPEAKER_02:  And just to clarify for the record, the change that you would like made to 1.26 is to add a prohibition on public service announcements from the time that a incumbent candidate files their nomination paperwork. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  that is correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. JT, can you please include that as part of the motion? Yes. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  There any other discussion on this item? \nSPEAKER_06:  Can you share them with us? \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. I have some questions starting with what was asked for at the last meeting and that is we had asked that there be a report to the city council about these violations and to see what they. You know, if there was any response from them about that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the request of the commission was for my office to report to the city council. After an internal discussion, my office feels that it acted appropriately. It was intentionally sent to this commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  for this commission to review whether or not there was a violation of the ethics policy and whether a policy change was necessary. The other violation that had been brought up by the chair, I believe, regarding equity and human relations commissioners, was a different issue altogether. That's why it was sent to their commission. So this is before you, just for you guys to make the decision or not on whether or not censorship was appropriate, whether or not the municipal code should be amended in a recommendation is necessary. This commission by making that recommendation \nSPEAKER_02:  The \nSPEAKER_02:  Now Mayor and Councilmember Austin, our censured could send requests to send the entire packet on behalf of the commission to the City Council as we discuss via email today. \nSPEAKER_02:  This commission is an advisory commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  There's a provision in the charter that prevents the commission from directing other departments, including my department. So you can always make the request for something to happen. It doesn't mean that we are obligated to make that request. So like I said, I like to reiterate my office feels like it. \nSPEAKER_02:  acted appropriately based off of what the violations were and does not intend to send. \nSPEAKER_02:  the memo to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Can you tell me? \nSPEAKER_05:  If the City Council knows about this, have they been formally advised? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  formally advised I don't believe so. \nSPEAKER_02:  Some of them may know. \nSPEAKER_05:  Take that. \nSPEAKER_02:  but whether they were formally advised, I don't believe so. \nSPEAKER_05:  And when did the city attorney's office get the complaint? \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe in early September, I'll have to check. The opinion was in September. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm assuming it's around that time. I would have to check our records. \nSPEAKER_05:  And when did the city attorney's office discover that council member Austin had apparently the original complaint was about Vice Mayor Richardson? When did the city council get to find out about the- \nSPEAKER_05:  PSA that Council Member Austin had done. \nSPEAKER_02:  at the time. Are you asking when my office found out? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. At the time that we looked into the videos that featured Council, it was Vice Mayor Richardson at the time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Did your office talk to the firefighters group at all about this? \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe the former city attorney \nSPEAKER_02:  Charlie Parkin spoke with all three of them. I was not privy to those discussions. I can't to speak to what was discussed. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Um. \nSPEAKER_05:  I am asked the city attorney yesterday, whether there was report for us on this because we had asked specifically for it and we didn't get any report back in this item in the agenda. \nSPEAKER_05:  I also asked what the city council's procedures were. \nSPEAKER_05:  about \nSPEAKER_05:  censure. \nSPEAKER_05:  My understanding of the process of censures is that it usually is a body itself, censures its members. And I could only remember one at the time in my own recollection, which was back in the 90s. And I was referred to one in 2018. \nSPEAKER_05:  And that was when a member of the council was censured. So I looked back at the \nSPEAKER_05:  agenda items when that happened. \nSPEAKER_05:  And in that case, the motion for censure came from 4CD Council members. It was based on \nSPEAKER_05:  police reports that had been obtained and apparently reviewed when the matter was called \nSPEAKER_05:  at the City Council meeting. All the City Council members were present, including the person that was the subject of the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  that person first addressed the council and apologized and went on to explain about \nSPEAKER_05:  her personal history and then when I to recommend that \nSPEAKER_05:  and FX Commission be established and a lot of other things like that. When the motion was passed, \nSPEAKER_05:  The vote was eight to nothing and the person who was the subject of the motion abstained from the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  The memo, supporting it said that that was only the second time in \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  since the 1990s that the censure had been used by the City Council. \nSPEAKER_05:  and at the other time. \nSPEAKER_05:  Like I said, the one in 2018 involved conduct that was the subject of police reports, the one in 1993 involved \nSPEAKER_05:  offensive and harassing and discriminatory comments by a city council member in the city council meeting as I recall it regarding persons of certain sexual orientation. And the city council chose to discipline their member with with censure. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think the City Council needs to look at this and decide how they think their members should be disciplined and governed. I have trouble saying it should be censured because it appears to me that that has been used in cases where everyone witnessed it or in a case where there was police investigation and the person being, you know, accused. I think that has been accused, you know, had an opportunity to. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  to give a big explanation. We haven't seen the complaints. We haven't had a chance to talk to the people. We haven't gotten a report from the city, from the city attorney about the investigation that was done. Maybe the city council, I think the city council can be suggested to look into disciplining themselves. And maybe it'll be that they wanna do citations or they wanna do reprimands. They wanna do censures. Maybe they wanna ask for expulsion or suspension. I do not know. But... \nSPEAKER_05:  from what I can tell, there isn't anything very internal at the city council level about governing themselves. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm not comfortable with the way that the motion is worded and that's partly because we do not have Investatory power and we don't not have disciplinary power and the item that we're going to discuss next Is it compared is the powers that we have to the powers that other commissions have and every commission that has power to discipline Also has a power to do investigation and this commission does not it does not have that power I also there was some commentary by the \nSPEAKER_05:  the press about this item after we discussed it the last time. We've had no public comment at these meetings about any of this. So it's just been us talking about it. \nSPEAKER_05:  and \nSPEAKER_05:  And the comment raised the possibility that there should be a more public facing way that these complaints are handled. And I am very concerned about that. I think we actually should be having a subcommittee once we have enough members that aren't already on subcommittees to look into this to look more specifically for specific recommendations. Perhaps in addition to the ones that are in \nSPEAKER_05:  in this memo and I think we should be looking at what the overall process is for these types of complaints. In May during the primary election, \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  As soon as a few candidates that were not elected were charged with not having filled out their financial forms correctly, the City Attorney's Office was on it. \nSPEAKER_05:  and everyone learned about it. And that didn't happen with this. And I just concerned that we haven't completely \nSPEAKER_05:  Exhausted this so I'm fine going back. It's telling the City Council. I thought that's what we had already done I didn't necessarily think that we were asking the City Attorney's Office to do it. I just thought staff was gonna say \nSPEAKER_05:  Hey, did you guys know these items are coming before us? These are the reports from the attorneys. You know, you should look at them and see what the council did. \nSPEAKER_05:  We asked for that in November. We asked for it in December. If it doesn't happen. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I'm okay saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  Now. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we, I'm not comfortable saying censure this person. I'm comfortable saying. \nSPEAKER_05:  Please look into this because you have two members who appear to have violated the rules that you have for themselves and that you've set up for yourself and in whatever way you think is appropriate and see what the council does. In the meantime, perhaps we can come up with in addition to these things, suggestions for all commissions about how they internally manage. \nSPEAKER_05:  the conduct of each other. \nSPEAKER_05:  in connection with the things that they have, the rules that they've imposed upon themselves or for conduct among themselves. So those are, I think that's all my comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm sorry. It's not public comment time yet. We'll call on you when it's time for public comment, okay? If you just wait, just wait, this is our time to talk first. And then we'll have public comment. \nSPEAKER_05:  that public. \nSPEAKER_06:  Anyone else on the commission have comments? \nSPEAKER_06:  questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  I would just say I hear your concern, Commissioner Weiss, but we are not mandating. As you said, we do not have investigatory powers. We do not have the authority to direct discipline. So that's why this motion says that we recommend to the City Council. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  I will say honestly I've struggled with it over the last few months also. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if you take it out of the realm of the campaign. \nSPEAKER_06:  and just deal with the ethics violation. I think it's something that definitely we should have a word in. Because the city's ethics, not the code that we adopted, but the one that was in place that we were revising, specifically said that you were not supposed to speak on the city's behalf without specific authorization. I will say I had some conversations with Taylor over the last month to ask some questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  to make sure that I could get to a place where I was comfortable in recommending censure and one of them was asking if anyone had gone back and looked at the council records to make sure that they were not authorized to speak on the city's behalf and I was advised that the former city attorney who attended all the meetings reviewed everything \nSPEAKER_06:  could not recall an instance where they were advised that they were given authorization to speak on the city's behalf and that the two subjects of the situation \nSPEAKER_06:  have been advised of the situation and did not come forward with any documentation showing that they have been given authorization from the city to speak on their behalf. \nSPEAKER_06:  My other concern was how does this council's censure the person who was currently the mayor? First, the behavior that occurred when he was a council member and the vice mayor. And what I was advised by Taylor and Taylor correct me if I get this wrong was that they will be, if they choose to follow this path, they don't have to do anything when they get this report from us. But if they choose to follow this path, they would be censoring him in his role as the city council member. \nSPEAKER_06:  not in his current position. \nSPEAKER_06:  So with that said and knowing that we don't have \nSPEAKER_06:  investigative, but it's kind of black and white. What was provided, we were provided copies of the video. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think for us to not speak on a violation of the city's ethics policies. \nSPEAKER_06:  when it's an elected official. \nSPEAKER_06:  says volumes and weakens our credibility. We've talked long and hard about looking at everything through an ethical lens. \nSPEAKER_06:  And \nSPEAKER_06:  So I as much as it pains me because these are two members who have supported us very, very, very solidly. So I like to think that they're ethical all the time. But I think this shows that they're human and sometimes we make mistakes. And I think. \nSPEAKER_06:  As it goes forward, it shows that people need to start contacting Heather and Julian also to kind of ask questions and make sure that you're really asking questions before you do something. So that was why I felt comfortable making this motion at this time. \nSPEAKER_06:  I ask you all to vote your conscience. We don't always have to be uniform in how we vote. \nSPEAKER_06:  But if no one else has any comments, I'm going to call, but you have a comment. \nSPEAKER_03:  Well \nSPEAKER_03:  to the point on censure. \nSPEAKER_03:  I was not aware of how rarely center has been used. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I wonder if we could modify the motion. \nSPEAKER_03:  to say \nSPEAKER_03:  potential discipline. \nSPEAKER_03:  up to an including possible center. \nSPEAKER_02:  So if I may on this one. \nSPEAKER_02:  um, censure \nSPEAKER_02:  without \nSPEAKER_02:  criminal enforcement for conduct which wouldn't be appropriate here or administrative enforcement which there isn't a mechanism to do that or reporting to the FPPC which they're not going to care about this because it's a local issue. \nSPEAKER_02:  There is no other mechanism besides censure and public acknowledgment that the conduct of a member of a body was inappropriate, at least in the opinion of the body. \nSPEAKER_02:  or that the body disagreed with the conduct. \nSPEAKER_02:  because they're all elected. And because they're elected. \nSPEAKER_02:  They're put in by the people. They're accountable to the people. So if the people disagree with the way that an elected official is behaving in office, that elected official can be recalled. And there's a process for that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So why there are less centers in the city? I can't answer that question, but I can answer why center. \nSPEAKER_02:  is the only kind of mechanism that the City Council has for this if they want to reprimand one of its members. \nSPEAKER_06:  If the members are not comfortable with censure. \nSPEAKER_06:  Vote this motion down. \nSPEAKER_06:  If the motion fails, there's no reason that somebody couldn't make a subsequent motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  directing a letter be sent to the City Council acknowledging that this inappropriate behavior happened. \nSPEAKER_06:  and ask and reminding them about appropriate policy and letting them know that in the future we would recommend we might recommend censure. \nSPEAKER_02:  So what I would recommend instead if there is a member of this body that feels the original motion \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  They don't agree with the original motion. It would be better to make a substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. And then what the commission would do is they would vote on the last motion first. I'm going to try and explain this in the least confusing way. So the new motion, the substitute motion would get voted on first. If that motion passes, we never consider the second. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  If that motion fails, we consider \nSPEAKER_02:  The original motion if that motion fails \nSPEAKER_00:  the \nSPEAKER_02:  We're done. \nSPEAKER_02:  And if someone wants to bring or the chair proposed to the chair that we bring another item later on. \nSPEAKER_02:  to recommend the changes to the municipal code. We could bring a separate item at that time to make for you guys have the opportunity to give that feedback. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I can't make the substitute motion because I was near the maker of the motion. Correct. So I did not make that. \nSPEAKER_02:  You're the maker of the motion. Correct. So it would need to be another commissioner. \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Sharwham. \nSPEAKER_07:  I don't know if now is the appropriate time to speak or not, but um... \nSPEAKER_07:  What is the true two questions? What is the true effect of censor? And I'm really torn on this issue, and it's really more of a question for Taylor, is I'm very concerned that we are just an advisory commission. We do not have investigatory authority into what it is appropriate, as much as I agree with the substance, as it is appropriate for us to take an action like this, or is it really beyond really what our duties are as a commission, or can we square them within the duties, given the fact that maybe characterizing it advisory and asking the city council to take action. So hopefully that was clear. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in your first point, the point of a censure is a public acknowledgement that the conduct of one of its members, that the body doesn't agree with it, that it was either wrong \nSPEAKER_02:  outside of the mission of what, you know, the commission is, that's the issue that we're having with the equity and human relations commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  you know, holding yourselves out in the community in a certain way. So it's a public acknowledgement that the behavior of one of the commissioners, that the body doesn't agree with it. Whatever that conduct was, illegal or not. \nSPEAKER_02:  to your second question about the authority. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um \nSPEAKER_02:  You are making a recommendation. You're not taking action. \nSPEAKER_02:  I was provided direction to send this to you. \nSPEAKER_02:  by the city attorney. \nSPEAKER_02:  So. \nSPEAKER_02:  There was an opinion that you guys have the ability at least to make a recommendation on on what can occur. You can't require something to occur. You can't mandate something to occur. You can't call anybody before the body. You can't subpoena them. So it is a recommendation, like the chair said. \nSPEAKER_02:  And those types of things and ethical conduct that's still within your authority. And we've had the discussion with the chair and the vice chair if these types of issues. \nSPEAKER_02:  are not of interest to the commission and you guys don't want these types of things to come to you. That's perfectly okay. I can report back to my office and let them know. I just need a consensus that that's not what you guys want to do. \nSPEAKER_07:  I will just add, no, I do, I will just say that I do think it is appropriate for these items to be brought to our attention. \nSPEAKER_05:  Comment your wax. Yeah. Well, to that comment first, I will say. \nSPEAKER_05:  I certainly think that this discussion is showing that we are very interested in this and that we are very concerned about how these complaints are handled. Also I was \nSPEAKER_05:  I do not think that I had ever heard until I \nSPEAKER_05:  chair Morales just said it that there had been a dialogue between the City Attorney's Office and the and Vice Mayor Richardson and Austin and that they didn't I don't know that they didn't respond in a certain way or or something like that. That's exactly the kind of information that I think the commission needs to have and it needs to be in a report to us not \nSPEAKER_05:  We don't just hear that the other person talked to the, you know, ask the right question of the city attorney to get that information. I feel like that's the information that should be coming to us. I just. \nSPEAKER_05:  I love you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And that's how commissioners waste, if I may. \nSPEAKER_05:  So commissioner waste if I \nSPEAKER_02:  One of the things that has come out of this item, I had a discussion with the current city attorney. Part of my mandate before the next election is to create a process internally. So at least for election-related complaints, because as we've discussed, multiple occasions. This year, for some reason, there was an onslaught of election violations. It was not typical for my office. So moving forward, we are going to draft a policy of how those complaints are received and managed, and who they should be sent to, and when, so that there is more transparency moving forward, at least in relation to \nSPEAKER_02:  election violations. There's some problem with us being transparent about all ethics violations in the city Just because some of them can be personnel issues where there's a public interest in the election violations and my office Recognizes that so we are working on a way to improve the current process and Definitely looking at what happened this past election season so that we can do better in 2024 \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  I really am glad to hear that and \nSPEAKER_05:  And at least I'll say for myself as a member of this commission that's exactly some of the ways that I think the ethics commission could could help. And that's what I was trying to say when I expanded on the things that I thought we should be looking at is how are these complaints going to be handled? How are they going to become known to the public? \nSPEAKER_05:  Um \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's exactly, I mean, that falls right within what the responsibilities of this commission are, is to provide ideas and recommendations like that. So please don't act in a silo. Please include the commission in that process. I feel like I'm begging for this almost. And I don't like having to like pry out information. And that is the way that I've been made to feel about this. \nSPEAKER_05:  So. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I don't think that's fair to the city attorney's office. \nSPEAKER_05:  anyway. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we are all learning in this process. I think if you go back to what she said, this was an unusual election cycle. \nSPEAKER_06:  and \nSPEAKER_06:  without having faced it before and not having had an ethics commission before. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we are all doing the best that we can and like everything else that we're doing, we're creating processes as we go. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I don't think anyone is trying to hide information from you or anyone else. And, you know, on quite honestly, I thought of some of the questions that I asked on the fly afterwards. And it was not my intent not to share that with you, but as you know, we cannot contact each other in between meetings. So the only opportunity I have is when I'm speaking up here. So. \nSPEAKER_05:  I didn't mean to offend. I'm expressing my own frustration and concern about this. And I apologize if I did offend anybody by the way I phrased it. So my apologies. I would like to offer a substitute motion at this time. And I would like to suggest that the motion be that we recommend to the City Council that they consider disciplining. \nSPEAKER_05:  Councilmember Austin and Vice Mayor Richardson for the items that have been brought to our attention in these reports. As far as the second part of the motion which had to do with making these recommendations, I would prefer that we could report to them if that's appropriate that we plan to be looking at ways to improve or make recommendations for the municipal code section 1.26 and other other items relating to the election process with the assistance of an input from the city attorney's office. Some more along the lines of what's the third bullet point in the memo of October 12th. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there a second? \nSPEAKER_02:  So I'd just like to clarify, we discussed earlier, there is no other disciplinary action that the council can take against. \nSPEAKER_02:  Councilmember Austin and now Mayor Richardson. Censure is the only mechanism that the council has available to them. The FBPC didn't take action. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have no other way to... \nSPEAKER_02:  enforce what's occurred against Councilmember Austin and now Mayor Richardson. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's... \nSPEAKER_05:  It's censored ever mentioned in the city charter. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  No, it doesn't have to be. It's in Roberts Rules of Order, which is incorporated into the conduct of the City Council in the municipal code. \nSPEAKER_05:  We can't the City Council develop its own discipline process quickly. \nSPEAKER_05:  If they choose, I mean, could they choose something other than come up with something? \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  I think that that would be problematic because they wouldn't have investigatory authority to explore. \nSPEAKER_02:  So they would be provided the same information that you're being provided to determine whether a center is appropriate because \nSPEAKER_02:  two of its members spoke. \nSPEAKER_02:  without the permission of the body. \nSPEAKER_05:  We'll then let them make that decision. \nSPEAKER_05:  They can be advised by you as to what they can do and what they can't do and they can ask all the questions they want and they can ask for further investigation or whatever they want to do. I'm just saying what I mean. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just saying that what you're asking for isn't possible. \nSPEAKER_02:  Right? So what the current motion on the floor? \nSPEAKER_02:  That is an action that is possible of the council. At this point, we're at the end of the road on the actions that can be taken for these violations. \nSPEAKER_02:  The things that can happen are we amend the municipal code to prevent this in the future and that there is an enforcement mechanism for when this type of thing in a gray area occurs. And even with that, we could maybe add an enforcement tool, right, for violations of that section, maybe administrative citations because criminal citations prove problematic. The FBPC won't take these types of violations. But there's no other discipline that the city council can put onto its members beyond censure. \nSPEAKER_00:  The thing. \nSPEAKER_02:  And like I said, Seniors just a public acknowledgement. \nSPEAKER_02:  that the contact of one of its members, the rest of the body doesn't agree with it. \nSPEAKER_05:  Are you comfortable that Robert's rules of order? \nSPEAKER_02:  thanks for listening for watching community. \nSPEAKER_05:  would not allow this. \nSPEAKER_05:  would not allow a discipline. I don't know what other discipline not allow them to issue something like a reprimand if they that's what a censure is. \nSPEAKER_02:  would not allow a discipline. I don't know what other discipline. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think they're good. \nSPEAKER_05:  It has a different meaning to me. I'll say that. I haven't done all the research on Roberts Rules of Order. So I looked up one set of Roberts Rules of Order and Shenzhen was not used as a specific term. It was given as an example of things that could be done. It wasn't used. I didn't search Roberts Rules of Order for the word refer-man or discipline or things like that. \nSPEAKER_02:  So at this point, I've advised you on what I feel that the City Council can do. If you would like to continue with your motion, you are welcome to do so. \nSPEAKER_03:  Can we say? \nSPEAKER_03:  take action. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then the City Council can determine that censure is the only action they have available to them. \nSPEAKER_02:  That would be a possibility. \nSPEAKER_02:  That would be fine with me. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  So what if we made that a friendly \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  So what if we made that a friendly amendment to the first motion? \nSPEAKER_05:  to recommend it. \nSPEAKER_06:  that we changed the wording from censure. \nSPEAKER_05:  to take action. \nSPEAKER_06:  to take action. \nSPEAKER_05:  That's fine. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'd say to consider taking action. That's how I would, that was what my substitute motion was. Consider taking action. I'm not going to, I am not comfortable telling them what to do because I haven't been able to investigate. I haven't been able to talk to them. I haven't been able to ask to get answers to all the questions that I would like the answers that I would like the answers to before I vote on censure. So if I were sitting on the city council, I think I would ask some of those questions or try to get that information. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  can see it. \nSPEAKER_00:  So let's go. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  So be consider taking action or consider taking appropriate action. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  that appropriate action be taken. \nSPEAKER_03:  that the City Council take appropriate action with regard to Mayor Richardson and Council member Austin for violating the City's ethics policies and speaking on the act. \nSPEAKER_05:  So to recommend of the City Council that they consider taking action against \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_05:  Austin and Richardson Fuller. \nSPEAKER_05:  the items identified in the in this report that we did receive. \nSPEAKER_06:  in the \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, we would go with the rest of the motion. I would accept. \nSPEAKER_06:  that change that advice chair came up with. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  as a friendly amendment. \nSPEAKER_03:  as a friendly \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm uncomfortable saying everything in the report. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks for your time. You should turn on your mic please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. No, no. The rest of the motion would stay the same. \nSPEAKER_06:  The friendly amendment would be that the changes \nSPEAKER_06:  based on \nSPEAKER_06:  The information provided the commission and under the commission's limited authority. We recommend that the city council take appropriate action. \nSPEAKER_06:  Um \nSPEAKER_06:  for Mayor Richardson and Council Member Austen's violation of the city's ethics policy and speaking on behalf. So the rest of it would stay the same. \nSPEAKER_06:  Everything else would stay the same. We would just take out the center word and it would become taking action. I think we did commission to be benedictus. A second who seconded that with me. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes, she was a seconder. \nSPEAKER_06:  commissionative benefits are you okay with? \nSPEAKER_01:  that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Friendly, I'm not supportive of that at all. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think \nSPEAKER_01:  I like your original proposal. \nSPEAKER_01:  I go back to my original reading of this in October, the opinions that were laid out are City Guide. \nSPEAKER_01:  that we've all supported. We've introduced to the elected, etc. I could go on and on, but I think the opinions, the information, the video is on its face. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think I am so pleased that Council \nSPEAKER_01:  brought it to our commission to weigh in. \nSPEAKER_01:  and \nSPEAKER_01:  You know, I've heard I understand the \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  the desire to investigate, but in this case, this is not the type of thing that I think requires that. I do believe that I'm glad to hear the information that the two principals Austin and Richardson, the fact that they did not respond also is on its face. I \nSPEAKER_01:  I really I do think it is our job. It is an important thing. I'm happy to hear that the council is also going to develop a process for the future. \nSPEAKER_01:  But I think given what is before us. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the city guide. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think it's where we are duty. \nSPEAKER_01:  two \nSPEAKER_01:  I identified that this is a violation and I am listening to the opinions. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think censure is appropriate. \nSPEAKER_01:  And as we know, \nSPEAKER_01:  Council's also told us that they may come back with alternative and that is fine. \nSPEAKER_08:  in your shot well. \nSPEAKER_04:  by Czechism. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  by the \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I saw that Commissioner Norby has handed. Oh, I just want to show you something. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, sorry, I just want to make sure you sign it. Sorry, Commissioner Norvey. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's okay, that's okay. Thank you, Chair. I have a question. \nSPEAKER_00:  I believe \nSPEAKER_00:  Taylor will be able to answer it. Taylor, if you don't mind. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  If this passes the recommendation, \nSPEAKER_00:  to the council. \nSPEAKER_00:  It doesn't mean that council. \nSPEAKER_00:  We'll take any action, is that correct? \nSPEAKER_02:  Correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the way that your recommendations will be transmitted to council is by memo from with the assistance of Julian and Heather. That memo will be made available on a public facing website. Council and their staff all receive those memos. Then what would have to occur is \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe four council members would have to sign on to one item to get it agendized to have a discussion on this. So no, they do not have to take action. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. That's all right, bye. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_07:  So at the present, are we looking for a second for Commissioner of Wises? \nSPEAKER_06:  No, we were looking. I was asked, I, quite honestly, I feel more comfortable going forward. I was trying to find a compromise here, but if my second is not, is gonna hold firm, I'm gonna hold firm then also. \nSPEAKER_06:  unless she comes up with a substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  than she would need. Well, the back to her original one, when it says discipline, then yes, we are looking for a second. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. I'm really glad to hear that. \nSPEAKER_06:  my hand I don't know but hold on I think to where you can finish the shot we're gonna second her substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_07:  One note so that does not clear it was the first motion. So then the only thing it would be this is second, the first motion that Commissioner White said or the second motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_06:  because they're friendly amendment to change censure to take action was not accepted. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner D. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_06:  Your microphone's muted. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, it really resonates with me that the \nSPEAKER_01:  providing them the option to do nothing. \nSPEAKER_01:  not to say that they would. I think that this is... \nSPEAKER_01:  Knowing the records and the types of people that were I think this is going to be \nSPEAKER_01:  and important. \nSPEAKER_01:  item for them to consider. \nSPEAKER_01:  And I like that you have put forward the thoughts, the next steps that are likely to impact and when giving the timing of this and when it occurred and their roles. What would be centered. I think that this is an important thing for us to do. And \nSPEAKER_01:  It lays the groundwork for future work. I think that that's probably the most important thing to me. \nSPEAKER_06:  Anyone else have any comments? \nSPEAKER_05:  So \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm not sure where we are because I thought I had made a motion and then I made a substitute and then vice chair Pollock suggested some different language for the substitute motion. And I think that's where we left off on the substitute. So there's no say. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for your attention. \nSPEAKER_06:  So there's no second for the substitute motion. So your substitute motion dies for lack of a second. \nSPEAKER_06:  and your friendly amendment was not accepted. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we are at the original motion as presented. \nSPEAKER_07:  Could we have the subsequent motion restated? \nSPEAKER_06:  the substitute motion. If you'd like to restate your substitute motion, Commissioner Weiss. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. I'm going to go with the language that Commissioner Pollock had suggested which was to recommend the City Council consider taking action on the \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  the parent alleged violations by Commissioner or Councilmember Austin and Vice Mayor Richardson regarding the PSAs and speaking on behalf of the City Council without authorization and creating the impression that the city supported their candidates. \nSPEAKER_07:  I would second that motion questioning only if we should add then before vice mayor Richardson. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there any discussion on the motion on the floor? \nSPEAKER_06:  Is there any public comment? \nSPEAKER_04:  At this time, if you'd like to speak on this item, please approach the podium or raise your hand in the Zoom meeting. \nSPEAKER_08:  A year's back, I did everything except ship. And as you may know, I... \nSPEAKER_08:  as far as having the \nSPEAKER_08:  the platform and the technology and the support. \nSPEAKER_08:  and also the instruction, the proper instructions and whatnot to ship everyone. That didn't have to be- Sorry to interrupt, couldn't have stayed- I learned to- \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm sorry to interrupt. Good night, David. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  It would just be close to yeah, the commissioners on line are having a hard time hearing you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. And \nSPEAKER_08:  I would, at some point, you know, I would like to be able to return to work. \nSPEAKER_08:  because I did hold a career and very good job. And I did raise my child who's an adult now. \nSPEAKER_08:  And so I would like the opportunity in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  maybe South Long Beach. At some point, whenever you all say it's okay to do so. And, \nSPEAKER_08:  And I know that I would be able to provide, like I was saying a little bit earlier. \nSPEAKER_08:  quality feedback and whatnot in in regard to \nSPEAKER_08:  members or the \nSPEAKER_08:  the buys that come back to the city. So \nSPEAKER_08:  So I just wanted to add that. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you for your comments. This commission has no role in hiring. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you for your comments. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, maybe you could have a conversation so she doesn't have to stay for the rest of the meeting. She has that place to go on how to contact human resources about jobs. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll do it. \nSPEAKER_06:  keep here anyone online. \nSPEAKER_04:  No, that concludes both of them. \nSPEAKER_06:  You want to call the roll on the substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Narter. \nSPEAKER_00:  abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Dave and Adictus. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm sorry, Commissioner Dave Van Dijk just was the... \nSPEAKER_01:  of whichever's appropriate name or abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Oh, sorry. I could have been here. \nSPEAKER_01:  you know, you know. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Feeder? Commissioner, shot well. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner White. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  our Vice Chair, comment on that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04: odes that I wanted and prior, Mr. appearing. Well, I'll hold these mics up multiple times. Thank you very much but it works, and I'm looking forward to it again. I think so. Thank you for the slide, Mr. Bobby OH my, bro are excited. Wow, \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  mission in Norway you want to \nSPEAKER_06:  for Norway you want to stay in a stain or do you want to vote yes or no. \nSPEAKER_00:  abstain. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. So we have \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, are we allowed to abstain? Yes. I thought I remembered from... \nSPEAKER_05:  from when \nSPEAKER_05:  Amy Weber was in the in Taylor seat that people were not allowed to abstain. That's why I'm asking if they were present. \nSPEAKER_02:  to my knowledge. \nSPEAKER_02:  You know why? \nSPEAKER_02:  I hate to say this, I don't know off the top of my head, I will have to look at it quickly. GT, can you tell me what the mode is? \nSPEAKER_04:  The vote is 3-2. \nSPEAKER_06:  So three yes, two no one abstain. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  We \nSPEAKER_02:  to get free to freezest. Sure. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  It's in art, like it's in art. Is it in art? I'm looking for it. \nSPEAKER_06:  is it in our \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, JT had stained her there, nobody said anything. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Remember of the commission who is present when a roll call is called shall vote for or against the question \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Norvey, you're going to have to vote up or down. \nSPEAKER_06:  You can only abstain, Commissioner Norvay, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Norvey doesn't have his speaker on. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh no. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, Commissioner Norvey? \nSPEAKER_06:  It appears we have a rule in our bylaws about voting. \nSPEAKER_06:  Taylor's going to read it, but \nSPEAKER_06:  While you're thinking you're going to have to vote yes or no. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in section 9.3.3 for abstentions except when a conflict exists and its extension is required. Every member of the commission who is present when a role call is called, shall vote for or against the question unless excused by a majority of the commission members present prior to the calling of the role on such questions. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Norvey, how do you vote? \nSPEAKER_00:  No. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay, in that case the motion fails because it's deadlocked. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we go back to the original motion, unless somebody else has another substitute motion. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  Could you repeat the motion then please? \nSPEAKER_06:  Sure. J.K. Can you? \nSPEAKER_06:  call read it back because I don't have the language on the \nSPEAKER_06:  the changes we were going to make in the municipal code. \nSPEAKER_02:  I can do you have it, Chiti? \nSPEAKER_04:  No, you can. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the chair moved based on the information provided to the commission and under the commission's limited authority to recommend to the city council that Mayor Richardson and council member Austin are censored for violating the city's ethics policies and speaking on behalf of the city council without authorization of the city council. And because such communications by candidates in advertisements and public service announcements during an election cycle create the impression that the city supports the council members respective candidates and \nSPEAKER_02:  to recommend to amend Long Beach Municipal Code 1.26 to include a blackout period for public service announcements of incumbent candidates from the time they file nomination papers. \nSPEAKER_02:  Is there any further questions? \nSPEAKER_06:  their discussion. \nSPEAKER_06:  on the motion. \nSPEAKER_05:  I'm just going to say for the record that I do not have enough information at this time to vote on this, to vote on this, but I understand I have to vote. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  ab \nSPEAKER_04:  At this time if you'd like to speak please use the raised hand feature in the zoom meeting. \nSPEAKER_04:  Seeing none, that concludes by the comment. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm going to call it the vote. \nSPEAKER_04:  mag now comes chzena \uc5b4\ub514 \nSPEAKER_00:  No. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner David and Degrees. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Shawwell. City permits \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner Wise. \nSPEAKER_05:  today. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thanks, Chair Powell. \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm motion carries. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, I think that was probably one of the most challenging discussions we've had in our short tenure. And I want to thank everyone for being thoughtful and. \nSPEAKER_06:  And it's expressive. It's important that we be able to disagree sometimes and move forward. \nSPEAKER_06:  So the staff will take care of sending that. Then it's 5 o'clock. \nSPEAKER_06:  We don't have a lot of time limit except that Taylor has to leave us a little before 6. So we're going to play with the agenda."

So the memo, you know, this begins by providing information on how the R ethics commission here at the City of Long Beach stands today. \nSPEAKER_00:  and the legal opinions provided by the City Attorney on the Ethics Commission's roles, responsibilities, and current powers as they are. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then the research itself provided information on the tenduress jurisdictions that are found in the matrix and really just the matrix itself and the \nSPEAKER_00:  memo just kind of invites you to hopefully easily compare and contrast among the jurisdictions ethics commission kind of where they land on the categories that we identified here in the matrix. \nSPEAKER_00:  Just two little exclusions that do want to point out is just the ethics commission of Santa Clara and also Berkeley. So they are included in there, but they're not really, they're included in there as part of the matrix to just kind of show how varying commissions can be. But they're so unique that, you know, they really are kind of so far away as the structure of how the ethics commission here in Long Beach is is created. That there wasn't too much value, you know, staff believed in comparing those with the other seven. \nSPEAKER_00:  and \nSPEAKER_00:  So you can see the categories are included there. You know, I won't go over all of them, but we thought we used our worthy to note. So, you know, the operating budget, of course, submission vision, that's something we spent a lot of time on. Member compensation, level of staff support. Are they, you know, can a commission make policy recommendations? The authority to audit and investigate, and if so, in what areas, roles and responsibilities, what I will say is, as we are all learning together, that, you know, this is a high level, a high level, really matrix. At the end, you really could go into almost any of these columns and then dig in. There are a lot. And, you know, the details as \nSPEAKER_00:  We're doing the research, just kind of beginning to realize how intricate and nuanced things can appear. So there was a lot of just... \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, varying differences even within commission. \nSPEAKER_00:  being responsible for the code of conduct. Some of them were responsible for the entire code of conduct. Others for specific sections of the code of conduct. And you know, try to make some of that note in the matrix without going too far into it. \nSPEAKER_00:  So this really, I hope just provides you the ability to compare the varying commissions with the responsibilities under the categories. And really just also to see that I think the big takeaway for me as staff helping with this commission, supporting you guys is just that the commissions tend to arise with the responsibilities with the current needs of the city and kind of what their challenges are at the time. And you'll see that when commission goes into contracting and development, looking at those contracts, for example, others do a more traditional \nSPEAKER_00:  you know, in a governmental ethics area or so I'm just focused specifically on code of conduct. Others? \nSPEAKER_00:  also focus a lot on looking into lobbyists only or lobbyists and council activity so you know it does vary a lot. \nSPEAKER_00:  So there's no... \nSPEAKER_00:  one shape or one solution fits all approach. So I hope you found that, you know, the matrix helpful in the report and we're here to answer any questions that you may have. \nSPEAKER_02:  Are there any questions? \nSPEAKER_02:  Commissioner Wise? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'll just a comment and I guess a request. The thing that stands out to me are the last two or the near last two columns, authority to investigate and the authority to discipline of the cities that are selected that we have information from. It's clear there's only us, Berkeley and \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  and Santa Clara where the ethics commission does not have authority to investigate or to discipline. So, but my understanding is that that would require that's a power we don't have and that it would require an amendment to the charter to or the city attorney or the city council would have to \nSPEAKER_03:  to give us additional powers, correct? \nSPEAKER_01:  It would require charter amendment. And it would also require divesting authority. \nSPEAKER_01:  and out from the Civil Service Commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, at least from the Civil Service Commission, it depends on what it looks like. There are several offices under the charter that have authority to investigate. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_01:  and I believe the police department as well. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  I guess what I would request and maybe this is I don't know exactly what's going to happen at the Special meeting that we're having later this month of retreat or whatever I would appreciate learning a little bit more about how this committee this commission relates to the other departments in the in the city \nSPEAKER_03:  including the City Attorney's Office and the City Clerk's Office and when we make recommendations how they get handled and whether we can make recommendations to the Harvard Department or things like that. So I feel that's where we still have a lot to learn and understand. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sorry were you asking if you can make recommendations to the Harvard Department or were you just speaking? \nSPEAKER_03:  I would say I would like more clarification about what we can do with the within the existing structure that exists for this commission under the existing structure that this commission's operating in. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  So, this commission has the authority to make recommendations regarding government ethics to all city departments including the harbor and legislative. The hang up is on how to make that happen and who the recommendation goes to to ensure that the recommendation is considered by the appropriate body and that we're not violating the charter. So it depends on what your recommendation would be in how it gets messaged and sent across the city departments. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, because... \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  We \nSPEAKER_03:  in our motions and \nSPEAKER_03:  in October and November we asked that certain information be relayed to the City Council. And it was interpreted as being, as I understand it, being a request to the City Attorney's Office and the City Attorney decided that wasn't appropriate, that the center issue should be handled in this commission. And so I, the motion didn't say it should be made, that we were asking the City Attorney's Office to do it. I can say that I thought it was the commission's staff, you know, the Heather and Julian, whatever that would be doing that, but that didn't happen. And so when we frame motions that make requests or recommendations, we need to understand \nSPEAKER_03:  to whom or how we frame it. \nSPEAKER_03:  or that it's, or if it's completely outside of our power, that it is outside of our power to do that. \nSPEAKER_02:  I believe the motion that we made in that meeting was to ask a question of the city attorney as to whether or not that information had been relayed to the city council for them to take action. And the report that came back to us was that it had not been sent that the city attorney at that time, that city attorney did not feel that it was within his jurisdiction. He had made the information available to us because he thought we were the appropriate entity to address that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm just saying our motion didn't say it said the motion we passed said recommend the city council be notified about the complaint \nSPEAKER_01:  So I agree with the chair, the discussion surrounding the motion, my understanding of the motion. \nSPEAKER_01:  and what we had talked about is consistent with what the chair is saying. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um \nSPEAKER_01:  So \nSPEAKER_01:  Moving forward. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think we have an understanding of, and we can ask for clarity of if you're asking something of my office, it's very different to ask my office versus to ask the city managers to department who is assigned to you to do things on your behalf. \nSPEAKER_01:  So my office acts in a very different capacity. So if you're making a recommendation and you want that recommendation to go to the city council, we can be clear and motions moving forward that the request is for staff to do it, as opposed to the discussion that we had with what the city attorney's office was doing. \nSPEAKER_01:  I understand where you're coming from on that. It would be helpful if when you're making a recommendation that the ethics commission is clear on who they intend the recommendation to go to. In some instances like the lobbying ordinance. The lobbying ordinance is going to be in the municipal code of its amended. It would apply to everybody. It's clear because of the way it's written. The code of conduct also in ordinance. That goes in the municode. \nSPEAKER_01:  went out of our way to ensure that it was clear on who it applied to. So, \nSPEAKER_01:  If the commission can be clear about its intent, it will help staff be able to support what it is that you want. And we can do \nSPEAKER_01:  a job moving forward of ensuring that we're seeking clarification of what your intent is so that staff can help you effectuate it. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think the latter part is really important because sometimes the way this commission's been working, we frame motions during the meeting based on the discussion that we've had. And so when we frame those motions, \nSPEAKER_03:  It's rough. I'll just put it put it put it that way and and so if \nSPEAKER_03:  We don't make it clear and the motions as presented in the minutes don't make it clear who the request was going to or who the recommendation was going to. If it doesn't do that then \nSPEAKER_03:  We need \nSPEAKER_03:  at least I will speak for myself. I would need a reminder. \nSPEAKER_03:  that I need to make that, that make that clarification in the \nSPEAKER_03:  in the motion and we do that all the time and saying do you mean this do you mean that and stuff like that so I think we have to work together to get that to get that clarity because I think that has led that and this particular instance that led to some misunderstanding about what was happening in between meetings and and you know that was disappointing because then what was going to happen at least what I thought was going to happen didn't happen. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I didn't understand it until I was in the meeting. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  If we can agree as staff and a commission to engage in a team effort. \nSPEAKER_01:  In clarity on this, I think staff can absolutely meet you halfway on that and seek in clarity if it's not clear. \nSPEAKER_01:  Once the motion happens, if it's unclear after the fact, we will have to \nSPEAKER_01:  re-agenda the item. \nSPEAKER_01:  to seek that kind of clarity as well. So sometimes the discussion helps point to what the intent of the commission was. Sometimes there are other factors. Sometimes the item itself is clear, as I said before. \nSPEAKER_01:  like the ordinances. \nSPEAKER_01:  We can definitely engage with you in that, but we do need your help. \nSPEAKER_01:  in \nSPEAKER_01:  meeting us halfway on what you mean on stuff. \nSPEAKER_02:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  So this item is just for receive and file. We had discussed at one point in time, possibly using this as a basis for an ad hoc. If we decided we wanted to look at expanding our powers, or making a recommendation to the council to expand our powers, but we've also made the agreement that we won't set up any new ad hoc until we finish with the lobbying. Because there are, I think there are at least one member of the ad hoc that would like to be part of any ad hoc that would look at possible recommendations on our powers. So is there a motion to receive and file this report? \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  and let the record show that Commissioner Anorvay had approval to leave the meeting early and is departed. \nSPEAKER_02:  We want to call the question. \nSPEAKER_02:  You can see a lot of men and women. Gen hardship. I drive, see a lot of courage Middle, we are here. many women that are so much better championship news this European human race is our second announcement. It will finish in 15 24. It will continue to move back. We will begin from June 14 to April 14. In use of Internet distribution. In 2018 all power support has been released in 2000s. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, sorry. I hit the button and I didn't notice until just then that it hadn't registered."

So with the EL report this month, you received the 2023 schedule attached in your materials. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. We don't need to go over that. Also, Julian and I, we have a prize chair and vice chair, but Julian and I are starting to brainstorm a retreat for the commission, hopefully in February. So we'll report more out to Chair and Vice Chair on what we're thinking in our next meeting and then bring that back to the entire commission in. \nSPEAKER_02:  January. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have a new motto for our education program. The city workforce voted, well, what came in number one was anchored in ethics. So that will be our new motto. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  second was navigating ethics together and third was \nSPEAKER_02:  The one that Commissioner Chattwell really liked. Ethics starts here with you and with me. So that came in third in an ethical compass was far behind and fourth. How many staff voted? 192. So almost 200. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  which was more than we got for the initial survey. So I was excited to see that. We got a lot of good feedback on the symbol. So I'm working with Raul. \nSPEAKER_02:  I forget his last name. He's our designer and the PIO office, working with him to kind of implement some of the suggestions we got and get it up to city standards. So excited about that. We finished our Code of Conduct video. It's about a 10 minute video that will be part of the Code of Conduct curriculum, working with TI to do an abbreviated version of that 10 minute video to bring to this commission in January just to give you a quick peek at that. So... \nSPEAKER_02:  That's exciting. Learning management system. We're a little bit behind in front loading all of the information that needs to go into the LMS. So we're now looking at probably a mid-February launch. However, \nSPEAKER_02:  I will, I just started last week and will continue doing so in January meeting with focus groups to get feedback on the quote of conduct training. \nSPEAKER_02:  and how to tweak that going into a citywide rollout. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then lastly, JT and I have started the discussion of the webpage transition. It's been requested. \nSPEAKER_02:  that we wait until the new council members and mayor, there's a lot going on. So. \nSPEAKER_02:  My web page isn't a priority yet, but so probably in January, I'll have control of that web page. And that is the end of my report. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  You want to have any questions for Heather? \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Commissioner White. Thank you. So what's the status now of the Code of Conduct actually becoming an ordinance? Oh my God. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's even written down in French. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the final reading was on December 6th. So we have, it got approved the final reading. I think it was just signed this week by Mayor Garcia. We're trying to confirm the exact date. So 30 days from that exact date sometime this week, it will be officially codified. Did I say? \nSPEAKER_00:  I say that right. So once I've been checking every day since it passed. So once we have that date, we can send you guys an email with the official effective date over the ordinance. \nSPEAKER_04:  We didn't get invited to the pen signing. You know, where they tap out all the pens. You know, I think he gets a big stack. And it's not as fun always as it seems. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. That's a light game. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thanks, out of all the panties. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry.

I was wondering if it was going to be more about you. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's you are. \nSPEAKER_02:  You were on my shoulder. \nSPEAKER_03:  Good. I'm happy to hear that. I'm happy to hear that.
