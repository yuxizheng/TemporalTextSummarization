        "transcript": "SPEAKER_08:  next applicant. \nSPEAKER_08:  So I'm going to let because of the technical technicalities involved in this. \nSPEAKER_08:  JT Naka Yama from the \nSPEAKER_08:  The clerk's office is going to be calling the candidates for their \nSPEAKER_08:  their interviews. \nSPEAKER_08:  because the technology is such that he knows exactly who's in the room when and can allow them to speak. \nSPEAKER_08:  So at this point we'll turn it back to JT to lead us through that process. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, our first applicant will be Eric Oats. \nSPEAKER_09:  All right, so first off, I'd like to thank the commission and the city for all the work they've done to put this whole thing together. It's been very, very helpful and going back and forth, even with JT has been extraordinarily helpful. So. \nSPEAKER_00:  receiving the vaccine \nSPEAKER_09:  I'd like to thank everyone involved. \nSPEAKER_09:  The first question refers to which is the qualities. \nSPEAKER_09:  I feel like I would have, it would make me a good number of this team. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so I've lived in Long Beach for eight to 10 years at this point. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I've lived across multiple districts, often on the border lines between different districts. \nSPEAKER_09:  which I feel like is giving me the opportunity to see. \nSPEAKER_09:  some of the different cultural groups that make up this city. \nSPEAKER_09:  but \nSPEAKER_09:  on top of that. \nSPEAKER_09:  both as a student at Long Beach State. \nSPEAKER_09:  and now in my current professional career. \nSPEAKER_09:  I've had the opportunity to develop a lot of teamwork and research skills. \nSPEAKER_09:  that position being very well to take on this type of challenge. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so as a student, I was a member of multiple on campus organizations and I took on a leadership role in them. And so both. \nSPEAKER_09:  in the \nSPEAKER_09:  both in the honor society for the major that I chose to go into, which was accounting. \nSPEAKER_09:  I took on a leadership role. \nSPEAKER_09:  helping students from disadvantaged backgrounds come to the \nSPEAKER_09:  come to understand the professional responsibilities and the professional expectations. \nSPEAKER_09:  in this role as someone who \nSPEAKER_09:  had no one in my family who. \nSPEAKER_09:  had this professional background, it was a great opportunity for me to. \nSPEAKER_09:  go and learn these things myself and then take that knowledge and pass it on to others. \nSPEAKER_09:  But most importantly, as that student leader in that organization and also student leader and on campus athletics organization. \nSPEAKER_09:  I was able to \nSPEAKER_09:  bring together different groups of people from very, very different backgrounds. \nSPEAKER_09:  and work towards a common cause. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so that's something that I feel like has been very important and very helpful. \nSPEAKER_09:  further in my professional career. \nSPEAKER_09:  I've had the opportunity to do a lot of similar things, both as a member of a team and as leaders of teams. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  I work in a professional accounting environment, which requires team members to \nSPEAKER_09:  work together towards. \nSPEAKER_09:  common professional goals. \nSPEAKER_09:  and \nSPEAKER_09:  So that's that's going to take me into. \nSPEAKER_09:  My second. \nSPEAKER_09:  Answer. \nSPEAKER_09:  which is talking about a situation where I've worked collaboratively with others. That's the half way to the bottom. That's the half way to the bottom. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  We have to have free money. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um, \nSPEAKER_09:  And so \nSPEAKER_09:  when we had tax reform happen recently. \nSPEAKER_09:  There was a lot of both research, teamwork and and deliverables that needed to be completed. \nSPEAKER_09:  in order to \nSPEAKER_09:  comply with the new laws regulations. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so this was an area where we had people who, with varying levels of expertise and varying levels of skill sets. \nSPEAKER_09:  or we had to \nSPEAKER_09:  Take. \nSPEAKER_09:  the former law and take the current law. \nSPEAKER_09:  go in-depth and research that. \nSPEAKER_09:  and research something new. \nSPEAKER_09:  and take on that challenge in order to apply that to our current situation. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so. \nSPEAKER_09:  specifically. \nSPEAKER_09:  with \nSPEAKER_09:  A particular code section. \nSPEAKER_09:  we had to take. \nSPEAKER_09:  a group of five or so people. \nSPEAKER_09:  one of which are \nSPEAKER_09:  Many of which had never worked in this specific code area before, some of which with more experience. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I was tasked with taking these people together. \nSPEAKER_09:  and bring a conclusion to our senior leadership about how we should approach this. \nSPEAKER_09:  section of the code. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so what I did is I worked with people. \nSPEAKER_09:  in order to help them. \nSPEAKER_09:  emphasize their strengths and shy away from their weaknesses. \nSPEAKER_09:  We had people who were very, very strong on maybe data analytics. \nSPEAKER_09:  but less strong in technical research. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so we took each part of the task. \nSPEAKER_09:  with that up. \nSPEAKER_09:  and then assign them out. \nSPEAKER_09:  so that those people who had specific skills were able to work. \nSPEAKER_09:  on the areas that were best. \nSPEAKER_12:  Du vil vise teknolog skal Prabub? \nSPEAKER_11:  It looks like he cut out for right now. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  so we can get a \nSPEAKER_04:  back. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  much time did he have left JT? \nSPEAKER_11:  You had about a minute, I think, or like 45 seconds to a minute. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah, he's got one more question to do. He's going to do it. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  We'll see if he's able to get back in. \nSPEAKER_09:  Mine just cut out. I'm not quite sure. \nSPEAKER_11:  No problem. You had about a minute left, so let me reset the timer real quick. \nSPEAKER_11:  Go ahead and continue. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm not sure which point I left off on, so I'm just going to go straight to point number three and talk about the biggest problem that we could come in. \nSPEAKER_09:  to contact with. \nSPEAKER_09:  And that would be. \nSPEAKER_09:  finding different. \nSPEAKER_09:  core differing opinions as to how the process should run. \nSPEAKER_09:  And so I think that \nSPEAKER_09:  most important is to find \nSPEAKER_09:  Find \nSPEAKER_09:  subcommittees within our larger group so that we can focus on our points of strength. \nSPEAKER_09:  and come together. \nSPEAKER_09:  under leadership so that we can. \nSPEAKER_09:  approach this head on. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, \nSPEAKER_08:  This is it. \nSPEAKER_08:  The time now for the commissioners to ask any questions if they have. \nSPEAKER_08:  Mr. Oates, do we have questions? \nSPEAKER_08:  No questions? I'm not seeing any questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. Thank you again. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. So our next \nSPEAKER_11:  Review will be... \nSPEAKER_11:  Port Ferrio, Rameezio, Oroio. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yep, you got it right. \nSPEAKER_11:  Your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_10:  All right, so hello everybody. My name is Porferio. I am a geographer on District One. I've graduated recently from Cal State Long Beach. And why I think myself as a good pick is because I'm a geographer. And what I mean by that is we tend to look at things differently, spatially, and provided that what we're going to do is \nSPEAKER_10:  Use data. \nSPEAKER_10:  that will be collected soon and \nSPEAKER_10:  all of that. \nSPEAKER_10:  We will. \nSPEAKER_10:  be able to one observe the changes that are happening in the district to see what trends and what \nSPEAKER_10:  major changes are going on around the city. \nSPEAKER_10:  And most of all, understand and contextualize all of this into producing maps that are easy to understand for anybody else. And second of all, accessible to everybody who wants to actually see this data. \nSPEAKER_10:  put on a map. \nSPEAKER_10:  And why I think I'm also a bit pick is because I lived in the city my entire life. I grew up through most of the changes in downtown. So back before the courthouse on Broadway was actually a courthouse. That was my neighborhood I grew up on. And I moved to the Washington Middle School area. And still I've been lucky to be able to grow up and actually see the city change first hand. And also be able to admire it from a geographers perspective on the changing landscape. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  how the population has reacted to that changing landscape. \nSPEAKER_10:  And that brings me to my second part, which was \nSPEAKER_10:  that three-night time at Cal State, we would constantly be forced to do group projects. Now, whether that is a good thing or a bad thing. \nSPEAKER_10:  doesn't matter. But none so we're sure one of our group projects involved a group of three myself and two other people in which we would actually have to lecture the class on the side reading or chapter that was given on the syllabus and we were assigned to. We would read the chapter, we would discuss with each other what parts we should focus on for the active discussion. \nSPEAKER_11:  You're halfway through. \nSPEAKER_10:  We would make questions to \nSPEAKER_10:  sort of \nSPEAKER_10:  guide \nSPEAKER_10:  the discussion into certain parts we wanted. \nSPEAKER_10:  We would also bring reference material. \nSPEAKER_10:  from other academic sources and articles we would think would be interesting in order to \nSPEAKER_10:  stimulate to discussion. \nSPEAKER_10:  And also we would have to make an outline. \nSPEAKER_10:  for the chapter, outlining what parts we felt more important than others. \nSPEAKER_10:  And so how we worked this out was, hey, that's all read it at the same time. \nSPEAKER_10:  If we have any questions with each other, let's talk them out. \nSPEAKER_10:  if anybody was an understanding the two of us would try to assist the other person who didn't understand and vice versa. And this... \nSPEAKER_10:  enable us to find a system. \nSPEAKER_10:  that worked for us in order to make sure that first of all our goal was to make sure that the class understood chapter, which was our goal that we focused on, but second of all, to make a detailed \nSPEAKER_10:  outline for the class so they would have \nSPEAKER_10:  study material in case we had an exam or anything else that they would find interesting and so on. \nSPEAKER_10:  So that was part two. Now the third part, biggest challenges. Obviously, other than the virus being able to get somebody sick and prevent them from doing their duties, \nSPEAKER_10:  I would think that \nSPEAKER_10:  biggest challenge after that would actually be somebody not being able to get along with \nSPEAKER_10:  another person in the commission. \nSPEAKER_10:  but I strongly believe that as adults, we all. \nSPEAKER_10:  should be able to make a compromise and understand that this is for the greater good of the city and that. \nSPEAKER_10:  This is something that the city is well, what we're doing affects the city deeply and will affect it for a considerable considerable amount of time. So that we have to ensure that \nSPEAKER_10:  It's that we do our jobs first and then focus and try to leave the bad beside. \nSPEAKER_10:  and that's everything you have to say. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you very much. Are there questions from any of the commissioners for the applicant? \nSPEAKER_08:  Not seeing any? \nSPEAKER_08:  All right. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you very much for your participation today in your application. \nSPEAKER_11:  So those are the only two applicants we have on the line right now. I'm going to try to contact one more to see if we can get them in. \nSPEAKER_11:  So, that would be just a moment. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  So we'll probably take a couple minute break right now. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right, thanks. \nSPEAKER_11:  So it sounds like that third applicant is working on getting into the meeting still, so it'll be just a moment. And then we should be getting the council district to applicants in the meeting shortly as well. Their schedule time was at 245. \nSPEAKER_08:  AT is there one applicant from CD1 that is not going to be showing up? \nSPEAKER_11:  For that one, I haven't heard anything from him, so we're not sure if he has any technical issues or if he got to mix up or something. So once we figure out what's going on, I'll content him either to this afternoon or tomorrow. I'll reach out to see if there's an issue or anything and then we might reschedule him till Friday. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, and I just wanted to remind you if you could please try to refer to their District or their applicant number when you introduce them. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, sorry, for Eric who was CD1-21 and Portferio, Portferio was CD1-24. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  And whoever you're going to see next. \nSPEAKER_11:  He just called in, it's CD1-19 Oscar Morales. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right, thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  and then we have not heard from CD1-5 per kin streak. \nSPEAKER_11:  and CD1-14 Tammy Maldenado has with Drone Her name. \nSPEAKER_12:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_11:  Kyle's running through the instructions, so we'll have him ready in just a few moments. \nSPEAKER_11:  Hi commissioners, we have Oscar Morales and his CD1-19 and Oscar will go ahead and start your time now. \nSPEAKER_18:  Well, excellent. Thank you. Well, thank you very much for having me here today and \nSPEAKER_18:  You know, hope that we can answer all your questions you may have. \nSPEAKER_18:  If I have any questions, you know. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_18:  So I was invited to apply here for these. \nSPEAKER_18:  So sitting here as a commissioner, a redistricting commissioner, and I, I've received some questions that I would like to go ahead and address. So the first question is what's about. \nSPEAKER_18:  If I were selected. \nSPEAKER_18:  Um. \nSPEAKER_18:  Equalities. \nSPEAKER_18:  my qualities that I will bring to the table. \nSPEAKER_18:  And that's the next question. \nSPEAKER_18:  First and foremost, I will say that. \nSPEAKER_18:  I'm a family man. \nSPEAKER_18:  I leave it here in the rest of the city of Long Beach for many many years. \nSPEAKER_18:  I also work in the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_18:  And I work as a \nSPEAKER_18:  you know, helping other people. \nSPEAKER_18:  That's being my goal through my life, helping others. \nSPEAKER_18:  and helping my community as well. \nSPEAKER_18:  the qualities that I bring to table will be honesty and integrity of course. \nSPEAKER_18:  commitment to the \nSPEAKER_18:  to the goal of these projects. \nSPEAKER_18:  positive attitude. \nSPEAKER_18:  empathy towards others. \nSPEAKER_18:  and some communication skills. \nSPEAKER_18:  that I bring in. \nSPEAKER_18:  That would be the first question. \nSPEAKER_18:  The second question you had went about, if I were selected, \nSPEAKER_18:  Um. \nSPEAKER_18:  to tell you about us. \nSPEAKER_18:  Eddie. \nSPEAKER_18:  collaboration that I had an experience for my previous employer. \nSPEAKER_18:  and to tell you about what the goal was of the project. \nSPEAKER_18:  I worked on a project with Habitat for Humanity. I worked for that organization for six years, almost six years, five and a half years. \nSPEAKER_18:  And that. \nSPEAKER_18:  as a program manager. \nSPEAKER_18:  and the housing department. \nSPEAKER_18:  One of my goals was to \nSPEAKER_18:  bring the organization up to standards as to getting them approved for us a housing housing counselor. \nSPEAKER_18:  housing counseling and agency to provide services to families. \nSPEAKER_18:  that were applying for the program for the housing program. \nSPEAKER_18:  And so. \nSPEAKER_18:  And doing so, my role was to... \nSPEAKER_18:  gathered information, collect all that information data. \nSPEAKER_18:  couldn't I get data together in submitting it to the board to the boards of the Habitat members. \nSPEAKER_18:  presenting that information. Also, my role was to \nSPEAKER_18:  Ensure that \nSPEAKER_18:  all the documentation and the program what's aligned with the the the excuse me the department of housing and urban development which was going to be reviewing the application and in doing so you're halfway through \nSPEAKER_11:  your halfway through. \nSPEAKER_18:  I think you're ensuring that they meet the qualifications. \nSPEAKER_18:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_18:  to think question any conflict regarding the uh... \nSPEAKER_18:  working through any conflicts. Yes, of course, working through any conflicts arises when you have a number of people working collaboratively. And so, and doing so, you have to meet weekly, you have to set up weekly meetings and five minutes check in to ensure that we going to moving through that process smoothly. And the last question you ask here about \nSPEAKER_18:  Well, actually, B part B. \nSPEAKER_18:  what experience you would you take from this experience? \nSPEAKER_18:  Again, communication is the key. I think it's the key. \nSPEAKER_18:  Communicating is... \nSPEAKER_18:  will eventually lead to \nSPEAKER_18:  achieving those goals. And then your third question here about the \nSPEAKER_18:  encounters and actions you will take. \nSPEAKER_18:  One of the greatest problems was issues that could arise. \nSPEAKER_18:  Again. \nSPEAKER_18:  having 13 people in a in a in a board meeting. \nSPEAKER_18:  Trying to find a solution. \nSPEAKER_18:  a mapping solution, there will be conflicts, like any big large families, there will be conflicts, and we have to resolve those issues by communicating. \nSPEAKER_18:  Respect each other. \nSPEAKER_18:  having empathy towards each other. \nSPEAKER_18:  and coming together. \nSPEAKER_18:  \uc54aze? \nSPEAKER_18:  compromise. \nSPEAKER_18:  That would be my... \nSPEAKER_18:  They're nice to see you, mine's here there. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Do any of the commissioners have questions for? \nSPEAKER_08:  For Mr. Morales. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any questions. So I think that you're finished. Thank you very much for taking time to participate with us to talk to us today and participate in this process. \nSPEAKER_18:  Absolutely. Thank you very much and you know, God bless all of you. \nSPEAKER_18:  Thank you so much. Bye. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Right now we're working to get a couple more people processed right now so we'll hold on take another little break. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Hi, is the person named Carlo on the meeting? Are you Perkins Drake? \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, great. So commissioners, we have Perkins Drake. Let me look up his number, give me one second. \nSPEAKER_11:  ESCD 1-5. \nSPEAKER_11:  So we'll go ahead and um... \nSPEAKER_11:  up. Perkins your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_16:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_16:  and I spent my time doing what I was doing. \nSPEAKER_11:  I'm sorry, what was that? \nSPEAKER_16:  You see, my time starts now. \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_16:  And doing my time, what am I doing? Am I telling you about myself or what? \nSPEAKER_11:  It's to answer the three questions that we sent you in the email. What specific qualities do you have that you feel will make you a good independent redistricting commission member? \nSPEAKER_11:  The second question is if you are selected you will be one of 13 members and two alternates of the commission Which is charged with working together to create maps of the new districts? Please describe a situation where you had to work collaboratively with others on a project to achieve a common goal \nSPEAKER_11:  Tell us the goal of the project, what your role in the group was, and how the group worked through any conflicts that arose. \nSPEAKER_11:  What lessons you would take from this group experience to the commission if selected? \nSPEAKER_11:  And what is the greatest problem that independent redistricting commission could encounter and what actions would you take to avoid or respond to this problem? If you can go ahead and respond to those three questions and you have five minutes to reply to those. \nSPEAKER_16:  Specifically, specific quality that I have for redistricting. I do believe that I've had \nSPEAKER_16:  Quite a long relationship with the city of Long Beach. I've lived here since 1970. \nSPEAKER_16:  I served on the CDAC Commission for the City of Long Beach and also for the \nSPEAKER_16:  erwant \nSPEAKER_16:  And going to time I did a lot of interface with minute officials in the city, many people all over the city. And when I worked with C-DAC, I did the easy zoning. And I went out into the community and met all people all over the communities. I spoke to them. \nSPEAKER_16:  I had them engage with all the projects that were going on in the city. \nSPEAKER_16:  So I've had a long time. \nSPEAKER_16:  and efforts and involvement in the city and on the commissions and in other aspects. So I think that I could bring that knowledge, those skills and that intensity that I utilize when I did all these other things within the city. So I think I could bring that value to the commission itself. \nSPEAKER_16:  you \nSPEAKER_16:  That's for speed distance. \nSPEAKER_16:  And you wanted to know about it. \nSPEAKER_16:  a project that I've done or... \nSPEAKER_16:  and how would resolve the conflict. \nSPEAKER_16:  I made a project that I did in my family with the Boeing Corporation last. We instituted \nSPEAKER_16:  a safety program here. \nSPEAKER_16:  It has to do with two bounces. \nSPEAKER_16:  So we had to bring in a whole new system for the United States Air Force. \nSPEAKER_16:  So we have to go out and survey all of the employees to find out what they needed to do. \nSPEAKER_16:  We'll have problems. \nSPEAKER_16:  and what can we do to help them? \nSPEAKER_16:  just satisfied the commitment to the United States Air Force. \nSPEAKER_16:  So we went out. \nSPEAKER_16:  We surveyed other companies first, we see what they had done and we came back in, we bought the team leaves from all of the different production groups, I had them test all the new machinery out, all the new tools. \nSPEAKER_16:  And in that process, we learned that a lot of people did not want those tools and they talked something around with them. So we have to really, really work hard to get them to understand that this is for a whole program itself, depending on this. Because if you didn't get the safety, because. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_16:  a two left on an aircraft that causes the crash. It eats one of those aircraft costs $425 million. \nSPEAKER_16:  Pwhy I post a map... \nSPEAKER_16:  So we went out, we touched all the employees, we asked them that concerns. We got their input and that was finished, implemented the process. You're about halfway. \nSPEAKER_17:  You're about halfway. \nSPEAKER_11:  you \nSPEAKER_16:  halfway and the lessons I learned from that. \nSPEAKER_16:  because that you really have to get people involved with anything that you want. Get there and put, put this stuff to put it in. They don't give you buy-in. \nSPEAKER_16:  We're not gonna read to us, we're not gonna do it. \nSPEAKER_16:  I'll be doing it in a little half past the end. \nSPEAKER_16:  I think that do. \nSPEAKER_16:  ... for all doctors ... \nSPEAKER_16:  that the Commission would be in Conor West. \nSPEAKER_16:  Getting \nSPEAKER_16:  Wir<|de|> \nSPEAKER_16:  giving them to understand what was going on. \nSPEAKER_16:  and have them see a value. \nSPEAKER_16:  in what's being done. Why are you just... \nSPEAKER_16:  the city. \nSPEAKER_16:  You have to give them something that they can really touch on and feel and think about because if they don't think there's not help them, they're not gonna be involved. \nSPEAKER_16:  And I think that that's going to be the biggest problem to get people really \nSPEAKER_16:  understanding what's going on and the reason why. Because if it's a changing demographics or whatever it is, let them know what it is. Or if it's an imbalance in a district itself, you need to get that information to them. Let them see the value again to process. \nSPEAKER_16:  because redistricting doesn't happen every day, but when it does happen, there is a valid reason. And if we can validate those reasons. \nSPEAKER_16:  I think that people would read to it. \nSPEAKER_16:  If you'd really love it, it'd embrace it. \nSPEAKER_16:  So I think that just getting the information out there and texting the people. \nSPEAKER_16:  and tune in the value process itself. \nSPEAKER_16:  and evaluate. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  We did you have more to say I'm sorry? \nSPEAKER_16:  No, I have to have Susan. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right. Do commissioners have questions for Mr. Drake? \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any further questions, so I think you're done. \nSPEAKER_08:  For today, thank you very much for participating in this process and applying for this position. We'll be making the selections next week. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  So that concludes all the applicants for CD1. Right now, we'll take a quick break to move them into the holding room and then we'll move in the CD2 applicants so it'll be just a moment. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, commissioners, we have the applicants from CD2 in. So first up, we will have Jenna Beckinhop from CDR, an applicant number CD2-1. \nSPEAKER_11:  Jenna, if you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_11:  Your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_13:  Hello, and thank you very much for this opportunity. I know from watching previous meetings of the FH commission that there were quite a deal of qualified applicants, so I feel incredibly honored to have made it to the stage. \nSPEAKER_13:  And thank you all for the work that you're putting into this process. I really do appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_13:  Now I know that I would make a great commissioner for a number of reasons. \nSPEAKER_13:  For one, I have been a resident of Long Beach since I was 10 years old. \nSPEAKER_13:  My family built a small business here. \nSPEAKER_13:  that I worked at since I was 16. \nSPEAKER_13:  And I volunteered for several years with the LGBTQ Center of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_13:  Basically, the city is my home. \nSPEAKER_13:  And if you'll allow me a cliche. \nSPEAKER_13:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_13:  having a part in maintaining fairness and equality. \nSPEAKER_13:  for all of my neighbors would really be a dream come true. \nSPEAKER_13:  I have a strong educational background in political science, holding both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. \nSPEAKER_13:  And although I started my graduate education in a PhD program at the University of California, Irvine. \nSPEAKER_13:  I ultimately decided that I would most like to spend my life working in the nonprofit sector. \nSPEAKER_13:  And I got a job raising funds for CSU Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_13:  but my educational foundation didn't go away. \nSPEAKER_13:  I have T.A. courses in urban and metropolitan politics, American politics, government, \nSPEAKER_13:  and I learned statistics from the professor. \nSPEAKER_13:  who served as the special master to redraw Virginia's congressional district. \nSPEAKER_13:  after federal judges. \nSPEAKER_13:  uh, rule of bed previous maps were unconstitutional, like Jerry Manderd. \nSPEAKER_13:  but most importantly, \nSPEAKER_13:  I would take this role very seriously. \nSPEAKER_13:  districts have districts matter more than most people realize. \nSPEAKER_13:  I'm uniquely aware of how voting districts have impacts on representation, and I would not take this responsibility lightly. \nSPEAKER_13:  I have plenty of past experience working on committees. \nSPEAKER_13:  Right now I serve as co-chair for CSU-OB's College of Education, Staff Advisory Council. \nSPEAKER_13:  I worked on a select committee at UC Irvine to put together a multi-day \nSPEAKER_13:  orientation event, welcoming incoming graduate students. \nSPEAKER_13:  Often times, planning my wedding feels like a group activity for the whole family. \nSPEAKER_13:  But I think that the most relevant example of my experience was my experience working at the LGBTQ center. \nSPEAKER_13:  We're about half. \nSPEAKER_11:  We're about halfway. \nSPEAKER_13:  as an AIDS Walk planning committee member. Every year the goal of the AIDS Walk is to raise as much funds for AIDS testing. \nSPEAKER_13:  prevention and care services. \nSPEAKER_13:  for organizations across the Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_13:  In 2019, due to circumstances that were largely out of our control, we had an exceedingly short period of time in which to put the project together. \nSPEAKER_13:  What made this event a success? \nSPEAKER_13:  was the fact that we had a wonderful group of people of all different ages, genders, color, backgrounds. \nSPEAKER_13:  and all working together. \nSPEAKER_13:  to bring it to fruition. \nSPEAKER_13:  And my biggest takeaway from that experience was that our diversity was not something to be worked through. \nSPEAKER_13:  But rather it was \nSPEAKER_13:  something that we specifically utilized to make the best event that we could. \nSPEAKER_13:  different people had different strengths. \nSPEAKER_13:  connections, ideas, perspectives. \nSPEAKER_13:  that had me not had. \nSPEAKER_13:  would have made for a poor end product. \nSPEAKER_13:  Now, the greatest problem that the that I anticipate the IRC will encounter will not be a problem so much as a challenge. \nSPEAKER_13:  We will be holding several public forums for community members to engage in the process. \nSPEAKER_13:  the people in the city really care. And I think we see that time and time again. \nSPEAKER_13:  Like me, I... \nSPEAKER_13:  like me, they have passion. \nSPEAKER_13:  and they want to see districts that best represent us. \nSPEAKER_13:  but the definition of best will vary widely. \nSPEAKER_13:  Um. \nSPEAKER_13:  and often passion can be expressed in anger or frustration. \nSPEAKER_13:  And the only fruitful way to respond is with patient. \nSPEAKER_13:  and real honest to God listening. \nSPEAKER_13:  Because nine times out of 10 people are angry because they... \nSPEAKER_13:  feel as though they are not being heard or understood. \nSPEAKER_13:  And if I'm lucky enough to be \nSPEAKER_13:  be selected as a member of this commission. \nSPEAKER_13:  I promise that I will listen with my full attention. \nSPEAKER_13:  and an open mind. \nSPEAKER_13:  to the person right in front of me. \nSPEAKER_13:  Everyone should and we'll have a chance to \nSPEAKER_13:  have the opportunity to participate in this process. \nSPEAKER_13:  and as a commissioner. \nSPEAKER_13:  I will always remember that I'm a steward of the public will. \nSPEAKER_13:  And thank you again, ethics commission for all the work that you're doing. \nSPEAKER_13:  hard work. \nSPEAKER_13:  and I really am very grateful for this opportunity. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. Do any members of the commission have questions for Ms. Beckenhawk? \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any. Then you're done. Thank you very much for your application and your participation here today will be making the final selections next week. \nSPEAKER_08:  Great. Thank you so much. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_13:  you \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, next we'll have Michael Beuritron. \nSPEAKER_11:  um CD2-9 and um he recently went under when a medical procedure and is unable speak so I'll be reading his response to the three questions and if there are any follow up questions he'll be able to respond in the chat and I'll read those aloud as well into the record so I'll go ahead and start \nSPEAKER_11:  I started working in Long Beach in 1992 and moved here a year later. I've lived in the same historical district neighborhood, a Minerva Park, part of the Second City Council District. \nSPEAKER_11:  For the first 10 years, I was employed by CSULB. \nSPEAKER_11:  as part of several community health research projects. This has made me acutely aware of the public health impacts of political decisions and of the disparities in health outcomes across the city. \nSPEAKER_11:  Currently I'm the Community Co-Chair for the Health Department's mandated HIV planning group and volunteer at the center as a support group facilitator. \nSPEAKER_11:  Because I've lived, worked, volunteered, and received services for almost 30 years, I filled out both my knowledge, compassion, and lived experience would serve me well as a contributor to the Registrating Commission. \nSPEAKER_11:  I've also worked on several multi-site research studies that require consistency across sites and collaboration on publishing results. At the same time, behavioral interventions worked with persons from a diverse economic and educational levels, ethnicities and identities. These experiences have helped me work with a diverse group of individuals from street-based populations to PhD-level researchers. \nSPEAKER_11:  Because everyone brings their own lived experience and agendas to the table. I've learned to listen and find commonalities that allow the decision making process to move forward. \nSPEAKER_11:  Geographically, I've worked in most corners of the city and have seen the unmet needs and issues in common brought about by everything from port pollution to language barriers that make it more challenging to advocate for one's community. \nSPEAKER_11:  as part of the Long Beach Planning Group I've mentioned. \nSPEAKER_11:  As both a participant and co-chair, I've worked to develop a priority plan as mandated by federal funding. From my personal experience group members have always contributed from a place of personal experience. This can influence decision making on any number of factors, race, race ethnicity, gender income, and even the agency or company a person works with. \nSPEAKER_11:  For me, it's important to acknowledge the impacts of personal experience and acknowledge that experience as contributing to the group's understanding of those who live in different \nSPEAKER_11:  part of the community. \nSPEAKER_11:  At the same time, I feel it's also important to look at data to guide decision-making so that personal agendas don't steer the process. \nSPEAKER_11:  In my case, it meant turning \nSPEAKER_11:  Turning not just to epidemiologic data to guide that process, but also the data and experience of community groups. Ultimately, I'm letting go of my own priorities to serve the goal of the group. I'm thinking that would be an important quality to bring to the commission. \nSPEAKER_11:  I don't anticipate any intractable issues. It's also difficult to predict problems prior to knowing the other group members and any agenda they may bring to the table. That being said, I suppose there's potential that someone could dig in their heels and be unwilling to compromise. There is also the possibility that someone would be disrupted to the process if they see their preferred outcome not happening. My feeling is the best way to avoid these issues is a discussion of the process beforehand and any knowledge meant that preferred outcomes aren't always possible. And that concludes this statement. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. Are there questions showing up in the... \nSPEAKER_08:  The the ministers have questions or do we want to put any questions. \nSPEAKER_08:  to the candidate in the chat function. \nSPEAKER_11:  You can read that. \nSPEAKER_11:  Or you can ask him the questions and he'll just respond in the chat and I'll read those responses. So if anyone has any questions. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  I just need the application number again. \nSPEAKER_11:  The application number is CD2-9. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I don't know if everyone saw that he just sent us a note in the chat. \nSPEAKER_04:  explaining that his inability to speak is temporarily temporary. \nSPEAKER_04:  and then in the future that will be restored. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, thanks for bringing that to our attention. \nSPEAKER_08:  If there's nothing further from the commissioners, then I thank you Mr. Bruton for participating today and for being an applicant. We'll be making the final decisions next week. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, our next applicant will be CD-21. \nSPEAKER_11:  Ryan Giffin. \nSPEAKER_11:  Right, and if you can meet yourself and your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_17:  Good afternoon commissioners. My name is Ryan Giffin from the second district. And I want to thank you for your time today and allowing me the opportunity to meet with you. \nSPEAKER_17:  The specific qualities that I feel I would bring to the independent redistricting commission are a balanced common sense approach. \nSPEAKER_17:  Sound judgment, careful and thoughtful listening. \nSPEAKER_17:  fairness, patience, integrity, \nSPEAKER_17:  Analytical Analysis. \nSPEAKER_17:  and understanding of community issues impacting our city. \nSPEAKER_17:  Given these qualities, I feel that I can work with others towards consensus by ensuring all stakeholders, including commissioners and the community. \nSPEAKER_17:  have a voice at the table. \nSPEAKER_17:  In addressing the second question, I can think of several instances where I was part of a large group that required multiple stakeholders collaboration to achieve a common goal. \nSPEAKER_17:  For example, in the realm of academic university governance, I was appointed to several committees in my career. \nSPEAKER_17:  including administrative and faculty hiring. \nSPEAKER_17:  Cultural Diversity Program Initiatives, College Council President's Committee. \nSPEAKER_17:  and facilities planning committee to name a few. \nSPEAKER_17:  as one of 22 voting members on the facility planning committee at Orange Coast College. \nSPEAKER_17:  We were charged with planning and communicating measure-sea projects. \nSPEAKER_17:  One goal we had to achieve as a body was to determine \nSPEAKER_17:  where the new combined student union and college center buildings footprint on campus would be. \nSPEAKER_17:  Several meetings with multiple stakeholders took place, including input from the local community. \nSPEAKER_17:  students, administrators, faculty, so-kehl Edison, architects, and the list goes on. \nSPEAKER_17:  Each of these stakeholders would be impacted in some way. \nSPEAKER_17:  You know, do we build on open land? Do we tear down a building to make room for the new building? \nSPEAKER_17:  Do we build a bridge across Fairview Road? \nSPEAKER_17:  What about the environmental impact? \nSPEAKER_17:  so many issues to discuss and agree upon. \nSPEAKER_17:  So as with any large group where consensus is desired, conflict can be expected. \nSPEAKER_11:  You're halfway through. \nSPEAKER_17:  thumb committee members were extremely vocal and argumentative. Others would be coerced into agreeing with the outspoken individuals. \nSPEAKER_17:  and others were quiet and just didn't care one way or the other. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thankfully, we had a committee chair that managed the situation when debates got heated and veered the committee back on track to the main issue being addressed on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_17:  and develop subcommittees to tackle issues. \nSPEAKER_17:  that specific members were passionate about. \nSPEAKER_17:  Two lessons were learned from this experience. \nSPEAKER_17:  First, regardless of committee members, political views, job affiliation, their upbringing, educational level, etc. \nSPEAKER_17:  All stakeholder opinions matter if the goal is to achieve a fair outcome. \nSPEAKER_17:  All ideas, all opinions are valid, even if they don't seem like it at the time. \nSPEAKER_17:  Second, I learned I have the ability to be neutral while evaluating words, emotions, and data to disseminate findings and draw impartial conclusions and recommendations. \nSPEAKER_17:  Not only did my experience serving on the facilities committee helped, but my role as a human resource is executive over the years has cemented these qualities. \nSPEAKER_17:  As for the final question, the greatest problem I believe this commission may face is ensuring that the communities of interest that are a contingent population are represented fairly. \nSPEAKER_17:  For example, \nSPEAKER_17:  There are roughly 50 to 70,000 Cambodian Americans in the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_17:  Interestingly, the Cambodian community has been allocated to four of the city's nine council districts. \nSPEAKER_17:  dependent on census data, this can become a contentious issue. \nSPEAKER_17:  Therefore, the action that should be taken is input directly from the Cambodian community. \nSPEAKER_17:  where the commission must listen and take those comments into serious consideration by exercising sensible. \nSPEAKER_17:  reasonable. \nSPEAKER_17:  logical and fair decision making. \nSPEAKER_17:  Thank you again for this opportunity to potentially serve our city. \nSPEAKER_17:  and for your consideration. \nSPEAKER_17:  If there are any follow-up questions, I am more than happy to address the commission now. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing that any hands are up. Are there any commissioners that wish to ask Mr. Gifford a question? \nSPEAKER_08:  I don't think there are. So thank you very much, Mr. Giffen. As you heard me say, we'll be making the final decisions next week. Thanks so much for being a participant in this important process. Please stay involved. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our next applicant is CD2-34, Jessica Ponce. \nSPEAKER_11:  If you can unmute yourself, your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_07:  Hi, thank you for having me today. I really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. \nSPEAKER_07:  You have some amazingly qualified candidates, and I know this is probably a challenging decision for you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll... \nSPEAKER_07:  While I don't have an extensive background in politics or political science, \nSPEAKER_07:  I spent many years traveling overseas and doing business abroad, so I am very comfortable with um \nSPEAKER_07:  not only language barriers and getting through that, but also collaboration. \nSPEAKER_07:  And some of the other qualities that I think would be great to bring to the commission are my analytical problem solving. I \nSPEAKER_07:  and able to really see the big picture, but also really dial in and focus on the details. \nSPEAKER_07:  that will help get us through and accomplish that goal. \nSPEAKER_07:  I value collaboration, as I said. \nSPEAKER_07:  and utilizing other strengths. \nSPEAKER_07:  I always aim to listen to learn. \nSPEAKER_07:  because I think that that's extremely important, especially in a \nSPEAKER_07:  a commission and this sort. \nSPEAKER_07:  Um \nSPEAKER_07:  With that being said, many, I mean, I've been in many situations where collaboration has been key. I was a designer for a long time. \nSPEAKER_07:  So in order to get, you know, aligned together, you had collaboration between so many different parties, not only, you know, the internal company, but also \nSPEAKER_07:  external with your agents and factories that we're producing and also your clients. \nSPEAKER_07:  But I'm going to actually speak about a \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  Instance that I had. \nSPEAKER_07:  with a nonprofit that I'm involved with and I was the chair of a committee that was putting on our big fundraising event. \nSPEAKER_07:  And one of the members of the committee, \nSPEAKER_07:  uh, felt it necessary to... \nSPEAKER_07:  insight, conflict and try and derail meetings. \nSPEAKER_07:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, instead of engaging and allowing that to happen. \nSPEAKER_07:  I instead focused on team building so that I could keep the rest of the group very much engaged. \nSPEAKER_07:  and have a successful event. And we ended up yes having a very successful event and \nSPEAKER_07:  Many of the members actually had a very positive experience. I think because of the extended \nSPEAKER_07:  team building. \nSPEAKER_11:  your halfway through. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. Some lessons that were learned from that. \nSPEAKER_07:  are \nSPEAKER_07:  First of all, to understand that usually when you have somebody that \nSPEAKER_07:  really just finds it. \nSPEAKER_07:  purposeful to insight conflict, it's usually not about whatever the situation actually is. There's probably something going on externally in their life and \nSPEAKER_07:  It's really important to be very neutral and not get focused on that because everyone will be derailed and nobody will accomplish anything. \nSPEAKER_07:  The other thing that I think is really important is to \nSPEAKER_07:  establish norms and expectations or codes of conduct. \nSPEAKER_07:  at the very, very beginning of the group so that everyone feels heard. \nSPEAKER_07:  And there's also kind of a set of rules to establish a safe and collaborative space as well as being productive. \nSPEAKER_07:  so that everyone can feel heard and. \nSPEAKER_07:  understand where the boundaries are. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I think one of the greatest challenges that is going to come up with the... \nSPEAKER_07:  commission is change. We are potentially making big changes here in the city. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  You know, people don't always respond well to that. So I think it's extremely important that we're listening. \nSPEAKER_07:  to people, you know, the community and really understanding why it is they feel the way they do if it's that they want the change or don't want the change. \nSPEAKER_07:  There's usually so many layers to a story. And so if we can really get it a place where we understand where people are coming from, \nSPEAKER_07:  we can make \nSPEAKER_07:  As part of the commission, we can make better decisions that will empower and impact \nSPEAKER_07:  People for the good. \nSPEAKER_07:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  you know, I think that that is the most important and \nSPEAKER_07:  communication within the commission and being sure that we \nSPEAKER_07:  Can \nSPEAKER_07:  communicate clearly and comfortably with each other. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Again, I'm not seeing any hands up. \nSPEAKER_08:  Are there any? \nSPEAKER_08:  Any questions from commissioners at this time from Ms. Ponce? \nSPEAKER_08:  There are not. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you very much for participating today. And \nSPEAKER_08:  The results will be determined next week. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our last applicant from CD3 is applicant CD2-34, Milton Smith. \nSPEAKER_11:  They'll tell you if you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_12:  JT I had Ms. Ponds down at CD2-34. \nSPEAKER_12:  Do I have that wrong? \nSPEAKER_11:  Oh no, you're correct. I have, I'll have to look up his number real quick. Sorry, I did him wrong on my list. So, but the applicant is Milton Smith and then I'll give you that in just a moment. \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  DTI have him as number 38. \nSPEAKER_11:  Oh, great. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Alright, Milton, if you're ready, if you can meet yourself and your time will start now. \nSPEAKER_11:  You're still muted. \nSPEAKER_08:  I keep you still on mute. \nSPEAKER_11:  I think you're unmuted now, so you can... \nSPEAKER_11:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Here it comes. \nSPEAKER_08:  We're still out here in you. \nSPEAKER_08:  There's a word in the chat he's going to try to log in again. \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay, we'll keep an eye out on our end. It'll be just a moment. \nSPEAKER_11:  He should be joining us momentarily. \nSPEAKER_11:  Hi Milton. Hi, yes. \nSPEAKER_11:  Can you unmute yourself? \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay, take two. Can you hear me now? \nSPEAKER_11:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  Great, yes, I'll start your time now. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. So first I'll say one of my greatest qualities is being resilient. \nSPEAKER_00:  and being able to adapt to change as it comes in real time. So again, thank you all for providing this opportunity for me to tell you a little bit more about myself and to discuss why I'd be interested in this position and why I'd be a good fit. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um. \nSPEAKER_00:  Another quality I would like to mention, you know... \nSPEAKER_00:  I think I'm a really good consensus builder. \nSPEAKER_00:  I take the time and again it's been a practice I've been doing for years but taking the time \nSPEAKER_00:  Um \nSPEAKER_00:  to listen to understand. \nSPEAKER_00:  folks, especially in community settings as opposed to just listening to respond. In my current role as the chair of our health department, I think one of the things that I really look forward to is when we have community input. \nSPEAKER_00:  and making sure those voices are being brought to the table. \nSPEAKER_00:  as well as working with my other colleagues and really just figuring out again we're representing various parts of the city and figuring out how to put those voices together for outcomes that are going to be beneficial to our city. \nSPEAKER_00:  I have lots of experience taking deep dives with various data sets, including looking at zip code level data, specifically as it relates to maps. I did a lot of mapping with some of my behavioral research work that was funded to look at HIV and other health disparities as it related to different zip codes, not just in LA County, but also here in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_00:  Like I mentioned before, I'm also very resilient and flexible. \nSPEAKER_00:  and really \nSPEAKER_00:  gung ho about doing this particular commission because I think for \nSPEAKER_00:  Historically, there hasn't been a lot of voices of color brought into this process. So I'm really excited about being considered. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thinking about the various activities I've kind of been engaged in over the years. I've always been that person that wanted to be involved and I think I've been in a lot of planning processes. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I'm going to mention the line that I think was probably the most challenging for me. That was local, localized. So I'm going to mention the Bixby Park remodel. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I had just moved to Long Beach maybe about a year. \nSPEAKER_00:  In that time period, I had, you know, \nSPEAKER_00:  became a new \nSPEAKER_00:  a citizen of the city and I wanted to get involved. So I jumped on board to being a part of our community planning for our neighborhood association, which is Alamedos Beach, which sits squarely in \nSPEAKER_00:  district two. \nSPEAKER_00:  We have to wait this part. \nSPEAKER_11:  We have right there. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so for me, I remember that process was very challenging because I felt like there weren't a lot of voices that were being brought to the table, even though they were in the room. \nSPEAKER_00:  specifically the voices of young people. And so I kind of spoke and advocated for some of the young people there and made sure their voices were being heard. And what was great about that process is that some of the best ideas for the park came from the young people themselves. And being able to advocate and support their voices being heard was a win for me, because again I'm supportive of young people. But it also was a win for our park, as you can see, some of the improvements that have been there. \nSPEAKER_00:  Um, thinking about the challenges that we might see, I think one of the challenges that we might see as we approach this. \nSPEAKER_00:  this project is looking at the timeline and the unknown challenges, and over within a specific timeline to get this work done, but we're also living through a pandemic. \nSPEAKER_00:  So being able to be flexible with that, and I think some of the solutions are, you know, creating realistic timelines and being very transparent. \nSPEAKER_00:  with the public about the process and making sure that we work on creating a consensus with each other as a planning body to be flexible and to be transparent as things come up in our lives as we're navigating this new reality. \nSPEAKER_00:  And then lastly, I would say \nSPEAKER_00:  being very thoughtful that again. \nSPEAKER_00:  We're doing this process as volunteers and stewards of the district of the district too. \nSPEAKER_00:  but also we live here and being honest with the fact that you know some of our biases might come up. \nSPEAKER_00:  and being able to walk. \nSPEAKER_00:  walk through those biases in a way that's going to be, you know, solution focused. \nSPEAKER_00:  And that's my time. \nSPEAKER_00:  Unless we just have any other questions from me again, I really appreciate you taking the time. And I know the challenges you guys see setting in those seats, navigating with these various well-qualified applicants. So thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I have other questions from any of the commissioners. I'm not seeing any hands up. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right, then thank you very much. And Mr. Smith and we'll be making the decisions. \nSPEAKER_08:  Next week and appreciate your participation in the process this fire and and please stay involved with the city \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  So that concludes the interviews for CD2. We'll take a brief break until 340. And then we'll start back up with Council District 3 and then following with Council District 4. \nSPEAKER_08:  So we'll be in recess till 340, correct? \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay, very good. \nSPEAKER_08:  We're off duty. \nSPEAKER_11:  Go ahead and get started. \nSPEAKER_03:  Shall we begin? \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I've just a few preliminary things. First of all, I want to welcome all of you from \nSPEAKER_08:  I said \nSPEAKER_08:  Council District 3 for these interviews and thank you for your participation in this process. \nSPEAKER_08:  One of the things we need to cover in each of these meetings is whether or not there's been any public comment received it comes in by \nSPEAKER_08:  email to the city clerk's office. So, uh, \nSPEAKER_08:  JT could you give us a report on that please? \nSPEAKER_11:  We didn't receive any e-commerce or emails. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  So then I'm going to turn this over to JT to call the applicants for their interviews. \nSPEAKER_11:  So our first applicant from Council District 3 will be CD3-23, Josiah Skanzalis, if you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_11:  and your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'd like to first thank you for your time and this opportunity. I'm very excited to be a candidate. \nSPEAKER_02:  I feel that my greatest quality is empathy. \nSPEAKER_02:  I always try to put myself another shoes in a stand where they're coming from. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm also good leader. \nSPEAKER_02:  For the past decade, I've worked as a manager and have successfully completed many projects with my team. \nSPEAKER_02:  First as the city planner and I was a site development manager for AT&T. \nSPEAKER_02:  I also have a lot of experience with commission hearings. \nSPEAKER_02:  Having worked at the city planner. \nSPEAKER_02:  I presented hundreds of projects before planning commissions. \nSPEAKER_02:  Citizen Advisory Commission, City Councils and Boards of Supervisors. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm also a good listener. \nSPEAKER_02:  and can communicate well with verbally and in writing. \nSPEAKER_02:  In fact, I've written countless planning staff reports and environmental impact reports. \nSPEAKER_02:  some hundreds of pages long. \nSPEAKER_02:  And lastly. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm also passionate. \nSPEAKER_02:  patient. \nSPEAKER_02:  and have integrity. \nSPEAKER_02:  and also ability to compromise. \nSPEAKER_02:  equality I feel every commissioner should have. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll be on the second question. \nSPEAKER_02:  As I mentioned in the first question, \nSPEAKER_02:  for the past decade. \nSPEAKER_02:  I've worked as a city planner. \nSPEAKER_02:  and site development manager for AT&T. \nSPEAKER_02:  and that capacity I've recalibratably. \nSPEAKER_02:  with others at the team to get hundreds of projects approved. \nSPEAKER_02:  from residential and commercial developments to new cell towers. \nSPEAKER_02:  One example of a recent project. \nSPEAKER_02:  where a cell tower collapsed and our team was tasked with giving it back up and running. \nSPEAKER_02:  Fortunately nobody was hurt. \nSPEAKER_02:  No other structures were damaged, but the property owner was livid. \nSPEAKER_02:  and didn't want another cell tower built on his property. \nSPEAKER_02:  our team was compromised of a... \nSPEAKER_02:  Radio Freaking Sea Engineer. \nSPEAKER_02:  Elysian Attorney, a realistic specialist, a site acquisition specialist, and myself, the leader of the Site Development Manager. \nSPEAKER_02:  As you can imagine, the main problem was finding a new location nearby that met all of the engineers' needs. \nSPEAKER_02:  For this task, I really say specialists in site acquisition specialists were assigned to finding potential sites. \nSPEAKER_02:  almost immediately a conflict arose between the two. \nSPEAKER_02:  It was an older tower that had been permitted long ago. \nSPEAKER_02:  And it was an area where the county had recently updated the zoning ordinance, making it almost impossible to build another cell tower nearby another property. \nSPEAKER_02:  The real estate specialist would find potential properties. \nSPEAKER_02:  And the side acquisition, side acquisition specialists would bet the properties for consistency with zoning ordinance. \nSPEAKER_02:  And since no size where we're working out, it creates a lot of frustration between the two specialists. \nSPEAKER_02:  at that point. \nSPEAKER_02:  I decided to step in. \nSPEAKER_02:  The first thing that I did was have a meeting with the two specialists. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I explained to them that it was nobody's fault and that we'll never find a solution if we're at odds with each other. \nSPEAKER_11:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  after meeting meetings and for the negotiations with the property owner. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're able to. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're able to agree on the salary portion of the property. \nSPEAKER_02:  We had a process subdivision with the county and obtaining parcel map. \nSPEAKER_02:  but we're able to get it done. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think the lesson I would take from this experience. \nSPEAKER_02:  is that we need to stay focused on the issues. \nSPEAKER_02:  and not get frustrated if we cannot immediately solve them. \nSPEAKER_02:  It's almost always a solution. \nSPEAKER_02:  and \nSPEAKER_02:  We just have to work as a team to come up with ideas. Think outside the box, have productive discussions. \nSPEAKER_02:  and ultimately solve whatever we're facing. \nSPEAKER_02:  We'll be knowing a question three. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think the greatest problem the commission could encounter is low public participation. \nSPEAKER_02:  If only a small amount of the public decides to participate. \nSPEAKER_02:  and comment on the commission's efforts. \nSPEAKER_02:  And it will make it harder to have a robust discussion on what's being considered. \nSPEAKER_02:  and feel like public input will be crucial to the success of the Commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  So, ensure we have public participation. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would use the tools available to the commission. \nSPEAKER_02:  and allocate sufficient resources. \nSPEAKER_02:  to the public outreach effort. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I would also make myself available to help. \nSPEAKER_02:  former city planner. \nSPEAKER_02:  I have a lot of experience with public participation. \nSPEAKER_02:  In fact, I once managed a project. \nSPEAKER_02:  It was a, um, \nSPEAKER_02:  wolf, thanks very wild animal. \nSPEAKER_02:  Rescue Center. \nSPEAKER_02:  that became extremely controversial. \nSPEAKER_02:  and garnered over 4,000 comments. \nSPEAKER_02:  in the public. \nSPEAKER_02:  and it was my responsibility to respond to each comment. \nSPEAKER_02:  And really that's just one of hundreds of projects that I presented at Penn and Commission hearings. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I think I'd make it strong. \nSPEAKER_02:  Canada for this position. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you, Jim, for your time and its opportunity. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. This is the time for any of the commissioners that have questions to raise their hand or otherwise let me know that they have a question for the candidate. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any. So thank you, Mr. Gonzalez for participating. We'll be making the \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  final decisions next week. So keep up your interest in the city of Lodvi\u0107, please. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Appreciate it. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our next applicant is CD3-25 Andrew Hale. \nSPEAKER_11:  Andrew, if you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can you hear me now? \nSPEAKER_11:  Yes, your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm a third-generation resident of Long Beach, having lived here all my life. I attended Long Beach Public Schools, Long Beach City College, and graduated from Cal State Long Beach with a degree in mathematics, with additional studies in engineering, accounting, law, and public speaking. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have been politically aware and active all of my life and have meaningful associations with many diverse communities in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have over 50 years of professional experience in engineering and project management. \nSPEAKER_01:  consulting. \nSPEAKER_01:  commercial real estate. \nSPEAKER_01:  These experiences have given me the skills necessary to define, manage, and effectively complete large, complex multi-dimensional projects. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have always been highly rated for my interpersonal skills. \nSPEAKER_01:  by skills for problem solving and problem avoidance. \nSPEAKER_01:  I am very good at delegation and forming and leading effective groups. \nSPEAKER_01:  I have effectively served on two city commations. \nSPEAKER_01:  Long Beach Year 2000 Committee, where I chair the disaster preparation subcommittee and a special committee for financial relief for earthquake retrofitting. \nSPEAKER_01:  For 62 years, I have been a \nSPEAKER_01:  troop level Boy Scout leader downtown Long Beach in the inner city. \nSPEAKER_01:  38 of those years as scout master. \nSPEAKER_01:  What I have accomplished, I help build the $10 billion international space station. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was one of the principal authors of the Successful proposal to build the International Space Station. \nSPEAKER_01:  I was in charge of the software aspect of system safety, reliability, maintainability. \nSPEAKER_01:  in quality. \nSPEAKER_01:  included in this responsibility was the supervision of the prime contractor, the five major subcontractors, and interfacing with the international partners on the project. \nSPEAKER_01:  My day-to-day activities consisted of administrative tasks, project management tasks, and leading large teams of interdisciplinary engineers performing complex analyses. \nSPEAKER_01:  and solving complex interdisciplinary system problems. \nSPEAKER_01:  We had to address the technical. \nSPEAKER_01:  people, financial and political aspects of the problem. \nSPEAKER_01:  there were always issues of competing interests between the parties. \nSPEAKER_01:  We needed to resolve those issues in a manner that best met the interest of all parties while meeting the requirements of the overall program. \nSPEAKER_01:  Everything we did was wrapped in multiple layers of government and contractual requirements. \nSPEAKER_01:  your bio turnaround. \nSPEAKER_05:  You're about half right there. \nSPEAKER_01:  I learned how to effectively in measurable terms complete \nSPEAKER_01:  complex tasks. \nSPEAKER_01:  You required products for those tasks. \nSPEAKER_01:  and the resources required and how to leave \nSPEAKER_01:  important. \nSPEAKER_01:  of the group so it's so composting. \nSPEAKER_01:  mission. \nSPEAKER_01:  The greatest problem. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think would be the \nSPEAKER_01:  Independent Redistriki Commission is a failure to create a team that can effectively perform their duties. \nSPEAKER_01:  I would address this potential problem as follows. Notice in this is what to do, not a how to do it. \nSPEAKER_01:  I believe that the accomplishment of the following three tasks would assure the commission would function in a very effective and productive team. \nSPEAKER_01:  first mold to commission members into an effective team. \nSPEAKER_01:  The members of the commission must mold themselves into an effective cohesive \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  with a group culture that will equitably and effectively meet the unique political, cultural and diverse redistricting needs of the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_01:  using the tools and other approved resources available to them. The commission must define the specific process by which they will operate. This will not be starting from scratch process, but rather using legislative mandated processes, processes of previous such commissions in California, and other resources provided by the city. \nSPEAKER_01:  the commission must develop the process that best meets long, which is needs and interests. \nSPEAKER_01:  commission then must effectively and fairly execute. \nSPEAKER_01:  that. \nSPEAKER_01:  process. \nSPEAKER_01:  I thank you for this opportunity. I would love to do this. \nSPEAKER_01:  This would be a wonderful legacy to leave. \nSPEAKER_01:  the next step in \nSPEAKER_01:  people long beach in their self governance. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. Do any of the commissioners have questions for Mr. Hale? \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any hands up or any indication that they have questions. So thank you very much, Mr. Hale. Thank you for your participation in this project or this part process. \nSPEAKER_08:  and we will be making our final decisions next week. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our next applicant is CD3-49 Dave Schuchler. \nSPEAKER_11:  If you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_11:  your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hello, can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  Before I get to my statement, hopefully I get to work on something with Andy Hale that the guy sounds incredible. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  If not on this, maybe something. I mean, wow. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  Hello everyone, my name is Dave Schuuckler to answer your first question about specific qualities. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think the first thing to say is that I'm a people person. \nSPEAKER_03:  for me. \nSPEAKER_03:  people do count. \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm an American. You know, my thing is freedom of conscience. \nSPEAKER_03:  And I think we have to respect people's choices. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  We have to respect people's ability to make their own decisions. \nSPEAKER_03:  As Mr. Hale said, ours is a system of self-covidness. \nSPEAKER_03:  So, you know, along with that, I have a strong analytical background and scientific mindset. \nSPEAKER_03:  For an example, I was trained in how to make maths and geographical information systems by Leo Estrada at UCLA. \nSPEAKER_03:  who, as you may know, is responsible for having made the entire national census more accurate from the 1980s through \nSPEAKER_03:  Well, through this census shortly now, after a set rest in power, Professor. \nSPEAKER_03:  I really respect that work. You know, I think it's from a statistical perspective, some of the most interesting work around, along with COVID tracking, obviously. \nSPEAKER_03:  And finally, I think in a group setting like the IRC, it's important to be able to... \nSPEAKER_03:  Laugh? \nSPEAKER_03:  only at oneself but \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  with everyone else. I mean, you know, we're all working together to do a job. \nSPEAKER_03:  and specific to the IRC. That job would be to draw fair and fair. \nSPEAKER_03:  accountable political boundaries. \nSPEAKER_03:  determined by the \nSPEAKER_03:  clear as possible shared understanding. \nSPEAKER_03:  of the available apportionment data and the, you know, \nSPEAKER_03:  factors involved and is \nSPEAKER_03:  and it want to be \nSPEAKER_03:  The other folks mentioned. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, we need public participation for that. \nSPEAKER_03:  Now, to answer the second question, we're about half way through. \nSPEAKER_05:  We're about half way through. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  of collaboration that I'd like to share. \nSPEAKER_03:  more mapping along with \nSPEAKER_03:  the harvest moon, something we saw last week. \nSPEAKER_03:  So after I took Professor Stratton's... \nSPEAKER_03:  GIS class the next quarter. My last quarter UCLA before I took high ADIS. \nSPEAKER_03:  I led our advanced GIS class in the project on \nSPEAKER_03:  where to convert facilities in LA County for cooling centers. So seniors, other vulnerable populations, you know, don't suffer in these heatways. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the two other students that were here had to meet. They were graduating. It was the spring. \nSPEAKER_03:  Time to get paid. \nSPEAKER_03:  And even though I wasn't the stats guy, it all kind of fell on me and \nSPEAKER_03:  you know they have to graduate. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that was more important than the project or even my grade. \nSPEAKER_03:  So did the project, got it done on time on target. \nSPEAKER_03:  Took the bad grade. \nSPEAKER_03:  Make sure they graduate. \nSPEAKER_03:  and \nSPEAKER_03:  A lot of my experiences in 2017 really taught me that this is a new and novel situation for a country. \nSPEAKER_03:  and we really need \nSPEAKER_03:  kind of define the best of ourselves to get through it. \nSPEAKER_03:  Hence mentioning the harvesterman. Something I'm very proud of is something that now is 19 years old. \nSPEAKER_03:  And that's the undergraduate philosophy journal in Berkeley, which I named. You can find it online. It's renamed at the idealist. \nSPEAKER_03:  But it's gratifying to say here and now that I... \nSPEAKER_03:  built something that was made the last. \nSPEAKER_03:  something that's to the test of time and has been a positive kind of impact on those. \nSPEAKER_03:  came after me. \nSPEAKER_03:  Now to answer the third question, the final question. \nSPEAKER_03:  The biggest problem I see is that of uncertainty. This census, if you're a stats nerd, this would have been the first census. If it weren't for COVID and a couple other factors. \nSPEAKER_03:  where we could have had statistical certainty in a complete count. I mean, you know, that's really kind of \nSPEAKER_03:  need over. \nSPEAKER_03:  for folks to geek out on. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um \nSPEAKER_03:  But more generally, our system is one where you've got to have accountability and the apportionment data. \nSPEAKER_03:  You've got to have trust in the public process through and through. \nSPEAKER_03:  And you know, a lot of states don't have, you know, a income please drop of your comments. \nSPEAKER_11:  Please drop a few comments. \nSPEAKER_03:  So. \nSPEAKER_03:  being, you know, getting certainty means having a group that's in power that has access to reliable information and that most of all \nSPEAKER_03:  that is supported by the city to do this job. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  And if you don't have any questions, I've got questions. \nSPEAKER_05:  Try. \nSPEAKER_03:  haha \nSPEAKER_03:  and jokes if we need jokes. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Are there any questions from the commissioners? \nSPEAKER_08:  for the candidate. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right, I see none. So I thank you, Mr. Schuchliffe, for your application and your participating in the process today. \nSPEAKER_08:  please stay involved. We'll be making our final decision next week. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_11:  That could clues the applicants for this council district. The other two are no longer being considered for the commission. So we'll take another break until 425, the council district four scheduled for 430. So we'll be back at 425. \nSPEAKER_08:  Very well. We're in recess then for 25. \nSPEAKER_11:  So we'll return from recess and our first applicant from council district four will be CD four dash one and Dreia Anthony \nSPEAKER_06:  Hi. Welcome. Thank you. Let me know when you're ready for me to start. \nSPEAKER_11:  Go ahead and start. \nSPEAKER_06:  Great, let me get my timer. \nSPEAKER_06:  So in terms of what I think qualifies me to make a good member for the redistricting commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  I really want to see Long Beach become the best it can be. I am invested in a more equitable future for the city. I have 20 years experience in customer service, so I understand what it's like to work with the public and to be a good listener to make sure that voices are heard and then also to communicate effectively and. \nSPEAKER_06:  professionally and one of my skills I would say is relationship building. \nSPEAKER_06:  I'm also ready to commit my time to this process. I understand this won't be \nSPEAKER_06:  You know, a very quick \nSPEAKER_06:  a quick thing that we're doing so I really am prepared to commit whatever time is needed for that. \nSPEAKER_06:  And then my work experience and my education, I think kind of uniquely qualify me for being on this commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have my master's and public administration from Cal State Long Beach. And most of my work experience at least in the last three years has been working with government agencies or contracting with them. \nSPEAKER_06:  As of that, I understand that transparency and accountability is the most important thing when it comes to working with constituents. And then finally, I'm not from Long Beach originally, but I am from the region from Los Angeles, so Ellie County. So I am familiar with with Southern California. And I have lived here for the last four years. \nSPEAKER_06:  In terms of a situation where I had to work collaboratively, I actually started a new job in mid-March working for a water district in Orange County. I started that role in mid-March and then a week after I started we went to full-time remote due to COVID-19. So I had to learn my job over Zoom and Slack. \nSPEAKER_06:  And additionally, my primary responsibility there, I'm an analyst and we run rebate programs. So we have to figure out as an eight person team how to take all of our rebate programs and move them to working with the new restrictions from COVID-19. \nSPEAKER_06:  There's definitely a lot of different ideas, sometimes a clash of ideas of how things should run and then obviously running a rebate program. There's a lot of small details. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we really took our time. We created flow charts that helped us follow what to do for different rebate programs. We also checked in with people that were beholden to our member agencies. We are a water wholesaler. We also checked in with Metropolitan Water District. And really took our time to understand everyone's viewpoint when creating the new ways that we would run our rebate programs. \nSPEAKER_11:  You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, and now it's October and our reddit programs have been running for six months under under COVID-19 and they're doing great and we have the same participation that we've had at this this time last year. So very happy. I'm really learned from that that collaboration and communication is key and we work better learning from each other. \nSPEAKER_06:  So in terms of issues, I think the commission might face, you know, to be fair, I've never done this before I haven't served no commission. I've certainly been to commission meetings that not served on one. \nSPEAKER_06:  But I think that based on my experience of working with the public, I can imagine there might be issue of people, maybe for some people feeling resistant to change. You know, we've had the district lines as they are now for quite a long time. Or there could also be a lot of people who feel like they aren't being heard. They haven't had equal access to resources. That they might be distrustful of the process, which I absolutely understand. And it would be my greatest effort to really make sure that I am hearing as much as possible from everyone and really taking as many opinions into account as possible. \nSPEAKER_06:  Again, it is my goal that Long Beach become more equitable as we move forward and that all communities are heard and seen. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that when we are coming up with decisions of what we want the districts to look like that we're looking at the full scope of the picture of what is our city. Who makes it up and what do they really need and want from us. So that's something that that is really important to me. \nSPEAKER_06:  And a sort of practical way would approach that, taking notes at every meeting, maybe making some kind of flow chart or some, you know, a very visual person. Just again, somebody to keep me organized so that I really know that I am keeping a track of as much information as possible from as many sources as possible. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. Do any of the commissioners have questions for Ms. Antony Moore? \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any hands up, which I think means that your interview is finished. Thank you very much for participating. Please stay involved with the city, regardless of what happens in this process. And. \nSPEAKER_08:  We will be making the selections next week at our meeting next week. So thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our next candidate is CD4-13, Daniel Fredericks. If you can unmute yourself. \nSPEAKER_11:  and your time starts now. \nSPEAKER_15:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  First off, thank you very much. You're going to forgive me the opportunity to interview. I mean, it's truly impressed at getting that email response actually very fast. The caliber of candidates that are running on this is phenomenal. So I'm glad to be amongst fellow colleagues and other citizens in the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_15:  I really don't have any political experience. I've never served on a commission, but I am a community leader in the city that I work. So I'm trying to get that in the community that I actually live in for it. \nSPEAKER_15:  I've not only lived in Long Beach since 2017. \nSPEAKER_15:  I haven't been here only a few years. It kind of gives me this rare view of outside looking in. I don't always believe that the way it's always been done is the best model for it, as change is always, you know, in it. So let's be part of that change, you know, and grow a bond of our own community. If I'm not selected for this, I believe I can use my professional background, which happens to be in real estate, to navigate maps and parcels of the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_15:  A couple of minutes are a reminder so that the key to selling a home is selling the community. \nSPEAKER_15:  So without understanding of that neighborhood, you really know that you can't miss that critical step in any kind of selling process that has to do with real estate. So in my occupation, I am a realtor. I consider each home a project. Each home comes with its own set of lessons as well as its own problems for it. I'm just going to give you an overview. And just once in a home being sold, we do many companies, many representatives. The name of few of them, they're always dealing with two real estate brokers. You have a mortgage broker, a title company, an escrow company, plus the two salespeople that brought in that client to buy that home. \nSPEAKER_15:  So everybody is also allowed to do inspections. So you can easily see that these are numerous reports, numerous contractors that we have to deal with on a daily basis to make a deal go through. \nSPEAKER_15:  The common goal is always to obviously close that transaction, but we always experience hiccups. No matter what kind of sale it is, even if it's brand new construction, we're going to have some sort of hiccup along the way. And this is where I try to excel. I like to be that bridge for communication in a very noisy environment. And a lot of the times we have to translate stuff to our clients that's not easily available to the public. So really, I really describe being a rilter as a counselor. We're pretty much navigating the ups and downs as we deal through our daily lives. So, most of these times, you're dealing with stuff that has nothing to do with that transaction, but it was caused because of that transaction. \nSPEAKER_11:  Your about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_15:  A lot of these experiences, you know, prepare you and have that real world scenario for it. And people always try to accomplish that same goal. \nSPEAKER_15:  So more like history and what I've done, I've sort of mini nonprofit words learned that \nSPEAKER_15:  We need to hear from everybody in order to make the best decision for it. \nSPEAKER_15:  public feeling of being represented. \nSPEAKER_15:  It's hard to make that decision and not have negative feedback on it. One of the problems I see that this commission could have is not everybody's voice being heard. \nSPEAKER_15:  whether it's by representation or communication, I think both of them are both ways for it. \nSPEAKER_15:  I'm having a lack of participation would also be detrimental to this commission on having everybody involved with it. So the best way I can see to resolve this would be first listening for it. And then you have to communicate with the clear concise message otherwise, you know, what are we really trying to accomplish. So using all the available sources for communication out there, I think we really need to have that community buy it in the end. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_15:  So with that, I thank you guys for considering me for the commission. If you have any questions. \nSPEAKER_15:  Thank you for your time. \nSPEAKER_08:  Are there any questions from any of the commissioners at this time? \nSPEAKER_08:  Mr. Fetrics. \nSPEAKER_08:  It appears there are not so I think that means that \nSPEAKER_08:  your interview is complete.

I am \nSPEAKER_19:  That's my job I represent. \nSPEAKER_19:  people, the working class people. \nSPEAKER_19:  Um \nSPEAKER_19:  I represent the working class people Long Beach Transit. \nSPEAKER_19:  So I know Long Beach and Long Beach is very dear to my heart. \nSPEAKER_19:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  One of the things that I'm currently working on right now. \nSPEAKER_19:  Um \nSPEAKER_19:  collaboratively with other people is \nSPEAKER_19:  About two years ago, I was chosen to be part of the \nSPEAKER_19:  hearing committee. \nSPEAKER_19:  for the United Way home walk, which is done every year in LA. \nSPEAKER_19:  Um, and... \nSPEAKER_19:  I've been serving on that committee for like I said the last two years. \nSPEAKER_19:  Um \nSPEAKER_19:  in that committee you have. \nSPEAKER_19:  people from labor like myself and CEOs from companies like JP Morgan. \nSPEAKER_19:  and other \nSPEAKER_19:  big names of other CEOs. I think the gas companies one of the other ones. \nSPEAKER_09:  So \nSPEAKER_19:  Um. \nSPEAKER_19:  Regardless, anyway, there's a lot of people there that \nSPEAKER_19:  have different ideas, different opinions. \nSPEAKER_19:  different levels of \nSPEAKER_19:  Social economic status. You're about halfway through. \nSPEAKER_05:  Your bow halfway through. \nSPEAKER_19:  Bye! \nSPEAKER_19:  and each one of those. \nSPEAKER_19:  has great ideas and I've \nSPEAKER_19:  been able to work. \nSPEAKER_19:  with \nSPEAKER_19:  you know, my peers in that committee. \nSPEAKER_19:  We've faced \nSPEAKER_19:  plenty of challenges, especially this year, currently right now with the COVID. \nSPEAKER_19:  Our event was planned for \nSPEAKER_19:  back in May. \nSPEAKER_19:  Of course, due to COVID, we've been working behind the scenes to get our events off the ground and ready to go. \nSPEAKER_19:  in November. \nSPEAKER_19:  Uh... \nSPEAKER_19:  So I can adapt very well. I've been in the military and \nSPEAKER_19:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_19:  learned. \nSPEAKER_19:  quite a bit on how to adapt and how to work with others. \nSPEAKER_19:  Um \nSPEAKER_19:  So some of the qualities that I have or that I can bring to the table is \nSPEAKER_19:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_19:  been \nSPEAKER_19:  I've worked with people like I said. \nSPEAKER_19:  that. \nSPEAKER_19:  Hello. \nSPEAKER_19:  Hi. \nSPEAKER_19:  Uh \nSPEAKER_19:  social economic status and then \nSPEAKER_19:  are regular. \nSPEAKER_19:  worker who I represent. \nSPEAKER_19:  today. \nSPEAKER_19:  I am very driven. \nSPEAKER_19:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_19:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_19:  world move. \nSPEAKER_19:  whatever obstacles we need to move out of the way to get the job done. \nSPEAKER_19:  and I'm committed to do everything I can. \nSPEAKER_19:  to help improve. \nSPEAKER_19:  the city of Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_19:  because not only am \nSPEAKER_19:  Do I? \nSPEAKER_19:  work in Long Beach. I live in Long Beach and I \nSPEAKER_19:  raising my two children along me. \nSPEAKER_19:  So with that, \nSPEAKER_19:  if the commissioners have any questions, I'd be more. \nSPEAKER_19:  Happy to answer. \nSPEAKER_08:  All right, I'm not seeing any hands up. \nSPEAKER_08:  Any questions? \nSPEAKER_08:  Mr. Varella. \nSPEAKER_08:  Seeing none, I think you're excused from the interview. Thank you very much for participating and please keep up your involvement with the city going forward. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  Our next applicant is applicant CD4-15, Peter Henik. \nSPEAKER_14:  Hello, my name is Peter Hanank. I am a resident of Long Beach. I've lived here since 2012 with my \nSPEAKER_14:  wife and two children. We live in Council District 4. I also have lived in Council District 2. \nSPEAKER_14:  Um \nSPEAKER_14:  I love maps. That's my short answer. I'm a, so in my professional life, I'm a professor. \nSPEAKER_14:  at Cal Poly Pomona. I teach sociology and criminology. \nSPEAKER_14:  And so I've extensively used GIS and other mapping software. I have great familiarity with census data. \nSPEAKER_14:  I've \nSPEAKER_14:  use census data extensively in writing my dissertation. \nSPEAKER_14:  I've used it. I have a Masters in Public Administration. I used it. My Masters program right in my thesis there. \nSPEAKER_14:  And I've used it in my, I also have a JD in law school. I wrote extensively about \nSPEAKER_14:  My topic of interest specifically is policing. \nSPEAKER_14:  So police practices in New York City, I extensively used census standards as well. I also am a choreographer. I like drawing maps of cities. I like thinking about boundaries. I like thinking about borders. I like thinking about neighborhoods and what makes neighborhoods interesting and different and special and unique and what problems they have and what makes one neighborhood different from another. I, I'm just going to explain this to you. \nSPEAKER_14:  lived before my wife and I bought our house and council district four. I lived in council district two across the street from Bixby Park. \nSPEAKER_14:  And there I was on the board of the Friends of XB Park. \nSPEAKER_14:  And if you're familiar with Bixby Park, you know that it's right on the border between Councillor Dorscht 2 and Councillor Dorscht 3 and Councillor Dorscht 2 and 3 are different, and they're different in a lot of interesting ways although they have shared interests. And those shared interests are the broader corridor, the shared interests are the park itself, retro row. So the fact that working in the Friends of Bixby Park on that board, I work with \nSPEAKER_14:  with Councilwoman Suja Lohantau and the engineering peers and then Suzy Price. \nSPEAKER_14:  and trying to weigh all of the different interests that these different neighborhood constituencies had in the park, the different visions people had of the park. \nSPEAKER_14:  who wanted to use the park for movies, who wants to use the park for music, who wants to use the park as recreation. And then obviously there's concerns about transients \nSPEAKER_14:  and crime and trying to weigh all those interests as well. \nSPEAKER_14:  And so I have a great experience working in that capacity. I also \nSPEAKER_14:  You know, organizer once upon a time, the before times I used to be organizer of a beach cleanup, which we haven't been able to do in quite some time. \nSPEAKER_14:  but also have experienced through the beach cleanup working through with the city, the parks department. \nSPEAKER_11:  your boss. That's right. That's right. That's right. \nSPEAKER_14:  as well as the police and different, different, different, different long Beach government agencies trying to figure out permits, trying to figure out permissions. \nSPEAKER_14:  So I'm very familiar with the process of trying to come to some kind of consensus. And I think that my experience is most relevant to what I'm doing now would be with the Friendsbeaksview Park, specifically the long-term master planning of what the park would look like. \nSPEAKER_14:  and trying to reconcile the different competing interests of what the park would look like. \nSPEAKER_14:  And in doing that, I think one of the things I really learned, I really took away from that experience. \nSPEAKER_14:  was that it's a lot easier and a lot more effective if you can come to some kind of consensus. \nSPEAKER_14:  at the front end about what your values and goals are. \nSPEAKER_14:  about what you're looking for, because inevitably, \nSPEAKER_14:  as you start planning things out. \nSPEAKER_14:  You're never going to be able to anticipate all the different minutiae. You're never going to be anticipate all the different wrinkles that show up. But if you have a shared agreement about what goal you're trying to achieve. \nSPEAKER_14:  and what's important to you. \nSPEAKER_14:  Then you can work through a lot of those disagreements versus if you can't come to that kind of consensus, then every disagreement has the potential to... \nSPEAKER_14:  you know, throw roadblocks up into your progress. \nSPEAKER_14:  As far as what I think the biggest difficulty because problem that this commission is going to face, it's how do we define a neighborhood? \nSPEAKER_14:  and how do we define the interests of a neighborhood? \nSPEAKER_14:  And I think that especially when you think about how one neighbor borders on another, which is ultimately what we are doing in drawing these lines. \nSPEAKER_14:  trying to figure out what makes a shared interest, a shared community interest. Is it defined by income? Is it defined by schools? Is it defined by parks, by businesses, by resources? \nSPEAKER_14:  Try and do. \nSPEAKER_14:  Come to the... \nSPEAKER_14:  come some kind of consensus, as I said, about that question. \nSPEAKER_14:  about what we define neighborhoods as and how we can reach some kind of agreement. That I think is going to be the biggest difficulty, but I think of course that's the point of what we're doing. \nSPEAKER_14:  So thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_08:  Any of the commissioners have questions from Mr. Hammond? \nSPEAKER_08:  Kelly. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm not seeing any or any hands raised. So thank you very much for participating today and for participating in this whole process. Please stay involved and we'll be making our choices next week. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_14:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_11:  And our last candidate for Council District 4 CD4-17, Ashley Jones, we have not been able to again contact out there and she's not on the call. So if we hear anything from her, we'll provide an update. \nSPEAKER_11:  And I'll tie that that concludes the interviews for today."
