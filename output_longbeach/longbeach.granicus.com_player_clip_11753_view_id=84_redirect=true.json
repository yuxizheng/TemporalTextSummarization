        "transcript": "SPEAKER_06:  Item number two is recommendation from staff to conduct a study session to review and discuss possible appointments to the Independent Redistricting Commission applicant sub pool from the selected applicants interviewed. I believe we received a written report from staff, but I'm going to ask them to supplement that with their comments and suggestions at this point. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, good afternoon commissioners. I'll be providing a brief overview of the staff report I sent out to you yesterday. So I'll start from the beginning with the Long Beach redistricting, independent redistricting commission was established by ballot initiative measure. \nSPEAKER_01:  DDD in 2018, which amended the city charter. And per the city charter office was directed to conduct a recruitment for the commission. \nSPEAKER_01:  We began outreach for the recruitment of the applicants in August of 2019. And the application period was open from April 1st through June 30th of this year. During that period, we received 400 applications. \nSPEAKER_01:  and following the close of the application period, city staff reviewed the application and determined their \nSPEAKER_01:  were 353 eligible applications pending verification responses submitted to be reviewed by the Ethics Commission. And at its August meeting, the Ethics Commission adopted the selection process, which included dividing up the applicants to be reviewed by three Ad hoc committees, resulting in the selection of 45 applicants to be interviewed. \nSPEAKER_01:  which included fri from each council district. \nSPEAKER_01:  Um, \nSPEAKER_01:  After the selection of the 45 applicants from the ad hoc committees, over three meetings on September 3rd and 4th, Ethics Commission adopted the interview process and moved forward the applicant selected by the ad hoc committees to be interviewed. \nSPEAKER_01:  The interviews of the selected applicants took place on October 7th, 8th, 9th, and earlier this afternoon. \nSPEAKER_01:  During the interview process, an administrative air was discovered resulting in 11 applicants not originally selected to be Interviewed being left inadvertently left out of the interview process So to correct this air at its October 9th meeting the Ethics Commission voted to invite the 11 applicants who originally selected to be interviewed and request staff to remove the 11 applicants from consideration who are not selected by the ad hoc committees a total of \nSPEAKER_01:  37 interviews were conducted and the Ethics Commission is now tasked with furthering narrowing down the pull of applicants to sub pull of 20 to 30 applicants, including two from each district. \nSPEAKER_01:  Once the sub-pull is established, chairwires will randomly select the first nine independent redistricting commissioners, one from each council district. \nSPEAKER_01:  So, staff, we're presenting two options for the selection. The first option for the selection of the sub pool is to select the minimum number of candidates, which is two from each district. And then that would total 18 of the 20 to 30 applicants you need to select for the sub pool. And then following the selection of those first 18, you would then \nSPEAKER_01:  select an additional two to 12 additional applicants to include in the sample. And that would be regardless of council district. The other option we have come up with is to select two select three applicants per council district. But then the only \nSPEAKER_01:  possible downfall that would be for council districts three or I'm sorry six and nine. It would be all three applicants who were interviewed. And then we are also open to any other suggestions any of the commissioners have. \nSPEAKER_01:  Oh, and then also sorry, one more note to keep in mind. For the supple, it also \nSPEAKER_01:  should reasonably reflect the city's diversity. And we want to remind you that there are no quotas or formulas or ratios outside of the council district requirements. And then the charter also refers to diversity as including but not limiting racial, ethnic, gender and sexual orientation. So with that, we're open to questions. And then you can also begin the process to select the supple. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think the question that's presented is how we want to go about this process. And if I understood him right, one idea is that we just picked you from each district and then once that's done, we look at what the people that are left and decide how many more of those we want to add to the sub pool. The other way to do it is perhaps to pick three from each district, which would get us a 27, which is within the, we're supposed to pick a pool of 20 to 30 per the statute. \nSPEAKER_06:  So, and there may be some other ideas, but we wanted to get agreement on what the process is going to be that we're going to follow as we discuss the candidates. So, \nSPEAKER_06:  comments or suggestions. \nSPEAKER_03:  I think in a couple of the districts, the top two, at least in my assessment, \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  really shine. \nSPEAKER_03:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_03:  which is leading me towards the \nSPEAKER_03:  thought that we start with top two in each district. \nSPEAKER_03:  Um. \nSPEAKER_03:  And then \nSPEAKER_03:  bring in the remainder if I understand the process correctly. \nSPEAKER_03:  Only in the sub-tool process, but the top two would be used. \nSPEAKER_03:  just to put into the little box with the balls to select the individual candidates for the \nSPEAKER_03:  Commission. \nSPEAKER_06:  actually \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, staff can correct us on this, but my understanding is that all of the people that are selected will go. \nSPEAKER_06:  will go into the box when their district is being considered. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, so for the random selection, what we are also planning is to potentially do it by district. So the two to five people selected by district, they can be placed in the lottery box. And then from there, chairwise can select whichever one comes out first. And that will be the first selected commissioner and we could do it one through nine. The additional way we could do it is just put all 20 to 30 balls in there. We'd have to re-number the commissioners because we don't have a set up that way. But if you plan, if you want to do that, then we can just see who the first nine come out and then kind of go back. But I think the best way to go about that is to do it by district. \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I don't like the second option, JT, because we might not get people from every district, I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  It's cleaner if we put each district in, do that district's draw and then move on to the next one. \nSPEAKER_04:  I agree with that. I think it is cleaner just to do it by district. \nSPEAKER_04:  especially when we don't have there's \nSPEAKER_04:  I think maybe two or three candidates that have the same ending number. So \nSPEAKER_04:  It would make it a little confusing, I think. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would agree that I think we need to do it by district and not \nSPEAKER_02:  I guess at the end of the day we need to select. \nSPEAKER_02:  at least. \nSPEAKER_02:  two candidates from each district. \nSPEAKER_02:  We need to select one candidate from each district. \nSPEAKER_06:  We leave \nSPEAKER_02:  And otherwise it would be a rather cumbersome process to kind of continue to redraw to make sure we have one candidate. \nSPEAKER_06:  And that's why I did it. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah, and actually Commissioner shot well for the sub pool. It's a minimum of two per district. So that's we will have at least two applicants to select from or for commissioner or for excuse me for chair wise to select from pending the outcome of the sub pool. \nSPEAKER_02:  So I just for clarification when we're going through this process. \nSPEAKER_02:  on. \nSPEAKER_02:  i don't know if i quite understand that we could select the first two \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we can go back and see if there's others that we want to add to that sub pool and we have sub pools for each district and then \nSPEAKER_02:  chair whites will draw from that sub pool for once we're done for that district correct. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, that's correct. So the way... \nSPEAKER_01:  That first option works is you would go by district by district starting with district one and then district one We have four applicants so you would narrow it down from the four applicants to the two applicants and then you'd go to district five and narrow it down All right, sorry district two and from those five applicants You would narrow it down to the two and then go bottom down each district and then At the end following the discussion for district nine you would have a total of 18 applicants in the sub pool and then following that you would need to add into the sub pool at least two but no more than 12 additional applicants To complete the sub pool of 20 to 30 applicants \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  When you say it's up. \nSPEAKER_02:  when you say sub pool there you mean sub pool \nSPEAKER_02:  plural \nSPEAKER_01:  It would be yeah, it would be sub pools. The sub pools would be of each district But they're overall sub pool directed by the Charter would be 20 to 30 And then chairwise would then go During the last item of this meeting would go and put the balls in the machine to randomly select one from each district \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_03:  from the subpoils. Yes, from the subpoils within the subpoils. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, from the sub-poors. From the council district sub-poor. The council district sub-poor of the main independent redistricting sub-poor, if that kind of makes sense. \nSPEAKER_03:  of the \nSPEAKER_05:  But there's nothing that says we have to have the same number of candidates from each district is there. \nSPEAKER_01:  No, so the, yes, so the only requirement is there's two per district and then outside that it's just to also keep in mind the diversity of the city and like the demographics. And then also included in the staff report as an attachment. We listed out all the demographic information of each applicant that you can kind of go through and \nSPEAKER_05:  so the \nSPEAKER_05:  and outtime. \nSPEAKER_01:  to check. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_05:  So if I could make a suggestion on how we go, let's. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would suggest that we do district by district. \nSPEAKER_05:  And I know when my subcommittee got together, we followed the same process that Chair Weiss did. \nSPEAKER_05:  I don't know what the other committee did, but we would. \nSPEAKER_05:  give our top candidates and then kind of discuss out which which ones we wanted to go further. \nSPEAKER_05:  So maybe if we could give our top three. \nSPEAKER_05:  for each district and then see where we match and which ones we have to discuss. \nSPEAKER_05:  Why we think they're a strong candidate and they should go forward. \nSPEAKER_02:  My Sud can. \nSPEAKER_02:  my subcommittee that I was on. \nSPEAKER_02:  I followed I think the same process and the only thing I thought as as we were doing I got done as I... \nSPEAKER_02:  Maybe it would have been better to do one extra. \nSPEAKER_02:  by going not five, maybe six. \nSPEAKER_02:  because then we can see where... \nSPEAKER_02:  We had commonality, which... \nSPEAKER_02:  Vice Chairman Rallis, you're purple to do three. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's kind of goodbye so \nSPEAKER_06:  Do we have to have a motion to adopt the procedure we're going to use or once we have been sent this we can proceed? \nSPEAKER_00:  I think actually because this is a steady session item, we actually can't have a motion on this, although you could include the motion in the next item and item three. \nSPEAKER_00:  But I think if there is consensus on how to move forward, we can just move to the next item. \nSPEAKER_02:  I guess. \nSPEAKER_02:  One clarification to Vice-Tremorales' point is she was suggesting that we \nSPEAKER_02:  Each provides three. That doesn't mean that we're going to select three from that district. We would still go with the top two. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's great. \nSPEAKER_05:  Two more. \nSPEAKER_05:  Two or three, depending on what we all agree together. \nSPEAKER_06:  But my understanding is the first thing we're going to do is just pick two from each and then we'll go back and look at all of the ones that are not in that group of 18 and from that group decide who else we want to move forward. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  into the \nSPEAKER_06:  I have \nSPEAKER_05:  I think if we have a discussion of the two or three that we think in each district is the strongest or the strongest candidates. \nSPEAKER_05:  and agree to those and then move forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  That way it doesn't look like we're trying to fill some quota. Awesome. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, second work. So then you can discuss two to three applicants per district that you want to include. And at the end, we can total it up and see where we're at. And then if you want to include more, or if we need to include more as well. So say, for example, we only end up in each district, two per district, except for maybe one district, then we'd end up with 19. So then we would have to include at least one additional one. But then in the end, if we select two to three from each district, we will end up with 20 to 30 and possibly won't need to add in additional applicants, pending anyone's opinion of. \nSPEAKER_01:  someone who was left out. \nSPEAKER_02:  In some districts, it might, for me at least it was a little bit easier to come up with say two and other districts I was like \nSPEAKER_02:  I could go with \nSPEAKER_02:  Much more than two. \nSPEAKER_02:  for the sample. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, then what I'm hearing is we're going to each person, as we talk about each district, each commissioner is going to \nSPEAKER_06:  who their top two or three candidates were from that district. And then we'll see where we are in terms of overlap and and how the what discussion we need to have. Is that what I'm hearing? \nSPEAKER_01:  Hmm. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, that's correct. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner D. Dictus, I see you just unmuted yourself. Did you or you're gonna? \nSPEAKER_06:  comment. \nSPEAKER_00:  No, I'm fine with the process. That sounds good. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_06:  about Commissioner Manicky. \nSPEAKER_06:  and find the process and Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, that works for me. \nSPEAKER_06:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, then is there anything further regarding this item on the study session? Item number two on the agenda. \nSPEAKER_06:  All right, if nothing will consider this item."

I actually had 19 and 24. \nSPEAKER_06:  Everyone was saying 19 and 21, I just went along with the crowd. But as I looked down, I gave 24 a higher number. \nSPEAKER_06:  but they were all real close in my mind, all three of those. \nSPEAKER_07:  in my mind. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I can confess that number 24 was my number three. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will also say that this is a particular district and I had a couple of these where all three were closed. \nSPEAKER_05:  at As Did I. \nSPEAKER_06:  So maybe we go forward with 19 and 21 and we leave 24 as a question mark in case we need to add on. \nSPEAKER_06:  later. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, I would say we put 19 and 21 in the sub pool be for sure and and and hold 24. \nSPEAKER_07:  or further discussion after we see who else is in that. \nSPEAKER_07:  What other district ends up with candidates, additional candidates we want to consider moving forward. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So let's proceed to district two then. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  And this time I'll start with Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  My top two on district two were CD2-38 and CD2-21. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Manakie. \nSPEAKER_08:  Mine was CD238. \nSPEAKER_08:  CD221 and CD25. \nSPEAKER_08:  Are we doing two? \nSPEAKER_08:  or \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're back to doing just two. \nSPEAKER_08:  Oh, sorry. \nSPEAKER_08:  Let me do 38. \nSPEAKER_08:  and five. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  My two picks here are \nSPEAKER_09:  21 and 38. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. DeBanadetto. \nSPEAKER_07:  Who dances religions? You're all right, well... \nSPEAKER_04:  That's all right, 38 and 5. \nSPEAKER_07:  Vice Chairman Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  So five and 21. \nSPEAKER_07:  And my choices were five and number nine. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  My \nSPEAKER_02:  highest were \nSPEAKER_02:  38 and 21. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, I was also a fan of 38. I can tell you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  and five was my third. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah, I would say that five was my third as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  somebody's doing a better tally than I. They have 38 with five. \nSPEAKER_04:  30 with six. Six and 21 with five and five with four. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  No, 21 had four because I see. There was an aim. \nSPEAKER_04:  Right, then we have CD5 with 4 and CD. \nSPEAKER_04:  to nine with one. \nSPEAKER_02:  and CD21 with four correct. \nSPEAKER_06:  to 21 hats for yes. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  So the top candidates then are 38 and 5. \nSPEAKER_05:  I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  that we had four commissioners voting for five and four commissioners voting for 21. \nSPEAKER_05:  Rack, I see those as tight in their top two. \nSPEAKER_03:  That's what I have as well. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I will say that I had \nSPEAKER_02:  5 is rated. \nSPEAKER_02:  Hi, Lydia, I give my top two. \nSPEAKER_08:  Also 21 is free to have it for me. \nSPEAKER_05:  And um, \nSPEAKER_05:  Is it appropriate to note any? \nSPEAKER_05:  specific information about a candidate. \nSPEAKER_07:  There's nothing that pro-Huitsit, I don't think. \nSPEAKER_05:  One thing in 21. \nSPEAKER_05:  that I noted is that the individual interviewed for the ethics commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  So I think it's someone who is demonstrating a desire to be \nSPEAKER_05:  involved in the community. \nSPEAKER_05:  We had. \nSPEAKER_05:  Recommended that folks who interviewed for the ethics commission who \nSPEAKER_05:  didn't get invited to join this commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  Apply for the Registricted Commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  And so I took that into consideration. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, this might be a case where we advance three. \nSPEAKER_04:  what I found \nSPEAKER_04:  unique about CD25. I thought very prepared. I really like the comments on the Cal State Long Beach advisory work and just found a very thoughtful, bright \nSPEAKER_04:  and looked towards impartiality. She mentioned that a couple of times. I found that very... \nSPEAKER_04:  compelling to me. \nSPEAKER_06:  And. \nSPEAKER_06:  I was really close on 38, which the rest of you really liked, but I liked. \nSPEAKER_06:  Number five for the same reason the Commissioner de Vennidict is just \nSPEAKER_06:  illuminated. \nSPEAKER_06:  So maybe we do the same thing here that we did with CD one. \nSPEAKER_06:  And we move forward 21 and 38 with five kind of on a holding pattern. \nSPEAKER_02:  or I'm comfortable also with bice versa. \nSPEAKER_02:  whatever is the right thing. \nSPEAKER_06:  Well, there were six of you that voted number 28 as your top. \nSPEAKER_06:  So I think that's overwhelming that number 38 needs to go in the pool. \nSPEAKER_04:  agreed. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  21 and five there were four and three and they were both my top two so. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh, I had four and four for 21. \nSPEAKER_05:  one. Yeah. We're in for. \nSPEAKER_05:  I show four commissioners on on both of those. Really? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  The ways and favor of your own free question to go with three on this one. \nSPEAKER_01:  Columbia Universityr\u0105ce final \nSPEAKER_01:  gere \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043cative. Thanks for your time for your time. Thank you very much. \nSPEAKER_02:  My, my only concern is if we, if there's a departure from the process that we started with CD one, if that's going to be a concern for \nSPEAKER_02:  staff or council. \nSPEAKER_02:  In other words, where we started just for the first round, we just selected two and then put on. \nSPEAKER_02:  hold on the remainders that we like. \nSPEAKER_06:  That was a question for Amy. \nSPEAKER_00:  Sorry, I didn't understand the question. \nSPEAKER_02:  and can you put it? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, please, yes, I will. \nSPEAKER_02:  So my only concern with, I'm comfortable moving forward with three for CD2. My only concern is \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  We're departing from the process that we established for CD1. \nSPEAKER_02:  where we selected two and then put a hold on the third. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I just want to make sure that that's not going to be any \nSPEAKER_02:  concerned for \nSPEAKER_02:  you know how we're feeding. \nSPEAKER_02:  But otherwise I'd find with putting them all through because they were all high. \nSPEAKER_02:  for me. \nSPEAKER_00:  Well, I think that it's important to be internally consistent, that it seems to me that what you did with \nSPEAKER_00:  But the first one was essentially the same thing. \nSPEAKER_00:  say that you have the ability to select. \nSPEAKER_00:  up to three candidates. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_00:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_00:  So if you have, \nSPEAKER_00:  I mean, I think at some point you are going to have to reduce the size of the applicant pool. \nSPEAKER_00:  And so it probably is \nSPEAKER_00:  prudent to note which one is slightly below in your estimation so that it's possible to do that. \nSPEAKER_00:  So in other words, idea of what you did with CD one might be a good idea because you otherwise you could end up if we do this with every council district then basically it's just the selection of three from every council district. So you'll end up having to do the narrowing at some other point in the process. \nSPEAKER_01:  Can we have another one? \nSPEAKER_06:  Would we have to or we'd still be under 30 if we do three for every district? \nSPEAKER_00:  It's still the end or 30. \nSPEAKER_00:  That's true. \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  And I see CD2 is a little different than CD1 in that \nSPEAKER_06:  The number two candidates both got the same number of votes and the one that we've got kind of on hold. \nSPEAKER_06:  in CD1 only had two votes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Robert,\u660e\u77ac to you \nSPEAKER_08:  Also, I like considering... \nSPEAKER_08:  You know, not so cool needs to be huge, but the people that we're advancing, we're advancing to the second kind of process where the \nSPEAKER_08:  nine conditions of choosing from. So I \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  like the idea of having more. \nSPEAKER_08:  more candidates for them to choose from, actually. \nSPEAKER_08:  I already got to 27 if that was the case. \nSPEAKER_02:  Have a D.X. show. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would agree with Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, and since 38 was actually not in my top two, I like the idea of all three being in there because it would include one of my top choices. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so just to recap, we're moving forward 38 21 and five. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Right, correct. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, so now we'll move to district three. And on this one, Commissioner Manicus, would you start please? \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I have 49 and 11. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Fiedler. \nSPEAKER_09:  I have \nSPEAKER_09:  23 and 11. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Dean Benedictus. \nSPEAKER_04:  Number 11 and number 25. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_06:  to your Morales. \nSPEAKER_06:  I have number 11 and 23. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have number 11 and number four. \nSPEAKER_07:  night. \nSPEAKER_07:  Oh no, 23. That's what I meant. 23. \nSPEAKER_07:  11 and 23. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Sharp will. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had 11 and 23. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  I had 23 and 49. \nSPEAKER_06:  Right. \nSPEAKER_06:  Alright. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  That's six for number 11. Six for number 11 and five for number 23. \nSPEAKER_06:  That's six for number 11. Six for number 11. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Right. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  my channel. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  And, and then the others just got one and two. So I think that one's pretty clear. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thanks a lot. \nSPEAKER_07:  Everyone agreed? \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes, let's go to district four and now we'll start with Commissioner Fiedler. \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  District 4 I have \nSPEAKER_09:  17 and 1. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner D. Bannadictus. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  I agree 17 and 1. \nSPEAKER_07:  Vice Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_06:  Uh, died. \nSPEAKER_06:  Degree with MS. \nSPEAKER_07:  17-1. \nSPEAKER_07:  And those are my choices as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh... seventeen and one \nSPEAKER_07:  Any Pearle \ub9cc\ub4e4ments that I don't know anything about? Holdmark, padlock. \nSPEAKER_07:  17 and one. \nSPEAKER_07:  and Commissioner Manicone. \nSPEAKER_07:  Edmonton M1. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  That one needs you. \nSPEAKER_07:  You got that back. \nSPEAKER_07:  I will say I thought there was someone else that was good in that district, but well, wait till we come to the next part. Yeah. Can we? Yeah. \nSPEAKER_08:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  District five and this turn is it Commissioner D. Benedictus, you go first. \nSPEAKER_04:  Lenny, you're on mute. Thank you, Bobby. 14 and 36. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right. Vice Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  36 and 42. \nSPEAKER_07:  and \nSPEAKER_07:  I have 42 and 14. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had 42 and 36. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  14 and 36. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. Manicky. \nSPEAKER_08:  36 and 42. \nSPEAKER_07:  and Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_09:  I had 14 and 36. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  pretty close. \nSPEAKER_02:  I will tell you that I struggled a lot between \nSPEAKER_02:  uh... fourteen and thirty six \nSPEAKER_02:  I had them basically neck and neck. If I would have picked three, I would have picked those. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Dido here. \nSPEAKER_04:  You have a similar case as the other with \nSPEAKER_04:  We have six for 36, four and four. It looks like for 42 and 14. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  to move those three forward. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm going to be comfortable with that. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would too. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  District 6 and this would be \nSPEAKER_07:  I call. I believe. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  \uc880 \uc549\uc558\uc5b4. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  So I have... \nSPEAKER_07:  34 and 19. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. Shatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had 34, I had 11 and 34. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_07:  I had to. \nSPEAKER_05:  34 and 11. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Mannicky. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have 34 and 11. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feeder. \nSPEAKER_09:  I had 34 and 19. \nSPEAKER_07:  a Finnish-speaking Romanian-born Asian.. and significant international Roe, a Reminder of Heritage Humanities Singapore It's also a rare tip for a veteran whom families\u773e have not beenongs of the 4 states said it was a tourism but now must march a\u56c9 for celebration is aolo individual \nSPEAKER_04:  same as Luke 19 and 34. \nSPEAKER_07:  and Vice Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  11 and 19. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  34 definitely. \nSPEAKER_07:  We have three, we have four for number 11 and three for number 19. \nSPEAKER_09:  Mm-hmm. \nSPEAKER_08:  Can you repeat that? \nSPEAKER_07:  That chair was I didn't catch it. We have, well, so there's six for 34. And then there's four, four, number 11 and four for number 19. \nSPEAKER_06:  So we would move all three forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  move all through. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, we could, I mean, I get to, I think that would be consistent with how we've handled the other ones. I'm not sure how the internal rankings compare district to district. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we're being consistent in what we're doing, those where. \nSPEAKER_06:  that they've gotten similar numbers. We're moving all three forward in those where they haven't. We're moving two forward. Right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So I have. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had \nSPEAKER_02:  I had number 14 ranked extremely high, so I would be comfortable with moving three forward. \nSPEAKER_05:  I would too. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Have fun. \nSPEAKER_07:  14, 4. \nSPEAKER_09:  14. \nSPEAKER_07:  There's no can't there's no 14 is there in this district. Yeah \nSPEAKER_09:  We have 11, 19 and 34, it was my understanding. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry I was looking at the prior district, my bad. My votes were... \nSPEAKER_02:  11 and 34 were correct but in going back to my notes I was looking at the \nSPEAKER_02:  prior district. \nSPEAKER_05:  So, but I think the point that you were maybe not, but I'd be comfortable going with all three. \nSPEAKER_05:  for this district. I think. \nSPEAKER_05:  it can be a commission or shot while it's right. Who's that? \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, I know that comment was geared towards I was looking at my notes for CD5. I'm sorry. Give me a couple seconds here \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, give me that. \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm comfortable with that. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, so all three candidates, 34, 11 and 19 will move forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right. District 7 and Vice-Chair Morales, I think I skipped over you as the person to go first. So I'm coming back to you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I guess it's appropriate I do my own district. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  next. \nSPEAKER_07:  Now, \nSPEAKER_06:  19 and 31. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  And those are my choices as well. \nSPEAKER_07: \u0131\u011f \nSPEAKER_02:  I had 19 and \nSPEAKER_02:  One P. \nSPEAKER_02:  8 \nSPEAKER_05:  I \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  1931. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Maniki. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I have 1931. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_09:  I had 19 and 28. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay, mission-new-diana data.

There's still six. There's still okay team. Yeah. And then. \nSPEAKER_06:  I did. \nSPEAKER_06:  Oh, there's still a team. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then there's 6 for 31 as well. \nSPEAKER_07:  by my kind. So I think that's pretty clear. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too. All right. District eight and we're back to you. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think that... \nSPEAKER_06:  Pretty clear. Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  back. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. Chatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  District 8. \nSPEAKER_02:  If we're only voting for two, I'm gonna go with 25 and one. \nSPEAKER_02:  This was a \nSPEAKER_02:  the district where I had \nSPEAKER_02:  for highly highly rated. \nSPEAKER_02:  District by 25 and 21. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry, 25 and 1. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  I had 25 and 29. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Mannicky. \nSPEAKER_08:  I have 20 and 25. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Fiedler. \nSPEAKER_09:  I have 25 and 20. \nSPEAKER_07:  having a PhD at a PhD. I remember a minute, a few updates and, other questions. You'll see if the hell is clearly a part of the diagram. needed independent agents, but they will soon get done, worked in real life. Next slide. How can I check? That's the point where you accident my \nSPEAKER_04:  Is it? One and nine. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Vice-Chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  9 and 25. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I have 25 and one. \nSPEAKER_00:  And two, three, four. \nSPEAKER_07:  25 looks pretty strong. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I think that's six. \nSPEAKER_04:  I see number CD 8 1 as 3 and CD 8 9 as 2. \nSPEAKER_07:  Nelson CD 20 and two. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  But we'll say that I had a hard time with... \nSPEAKER_02:  I had them all ranked very high. I just had two top picks. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  I had those four ranked as pretty high. I had two top picks. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  I have to say I gave, I ranked \nSPEAKER_07:  20 high as I did number one so \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_08:  I could say I had a hard time narrowing. \nSPEAKER_08:  it was far down. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah, actually. \nSPEAKER_07:  Nope. \nSPEAKER_07:  I mean, one possibility would be to move. \nSPEAKER_07:  would be to move to more forward if we \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  I was thinking if... \nSPEAKER_04:  25 \nSPEAKER_04:  And one did draw the most support. The two that are tied are nine and 20. Maybe we talk about their attributes. \nSPEAKER_10:  Yeah, we could do that or we could possibly list all your third option as well and see how that kind of shakes out too. \nSPEAKER_06:  Let's go with great. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Do you want to list your third option? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02: \u5b87\u86e4 \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, let's just go across then. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. Shotwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  My third option was \nSPEAKER_02:  Bear with me a second. Got so many numbers here. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm just confirming it. \nSPEAKER_02:  third option was \nSPEAKER_02:  Uh. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm sorry, my third option was 20. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commission your public. \nSPEAKER_05:  My third option was 20. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Manicky. \nSPEAKER_08:  My third option was win. \nSPEAKER_08:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_08:  Commissioner Feedler. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  My third option was 20-9. \nSPEAKER_09:  haha \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Muro stiri ben Exactly kestik \nSPEAKER_04:  My third option was 25, so I went with one in nine. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner vice chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  20. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right, and my third was 20 as well. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  25 and 20 have the most for sure. \nSPEAKER_05:  Well, 25, I think, had. \nSPEAKER_05:  the most in the \nSPEAKER_05:  Top 2. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  25 paddocks. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, six in the top two. \nSPEAKER_02:  In terms of the ones that we weren't selected, it looks like \nSPEAKER_02:  20 head. \nSPEAKER_02:  for. \nSPEAKER_02:  for the third choice, and that was not selected as part of the top two. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, so both 20 and 9 had two. \nSPEAKER_05:  votes in the top two. \nSPEAKER_05:  but then 20. \nSPEAKER_05:  head before. \nSPEAKER_02:  on that day. \nSPEAKER_02:  very good points at 20 head two votes on the top two. \nSPEAKER_02:  and nine ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  and then \nSPEAKER_02:  29 had one vote in the top two and one vote in the top three. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think it would be appropriate to move. \nSPEAKER_02:  251 and 20. \nSPEAKER_07:  I agree with that. \nSPEAKER_08:  I'm okay with that. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Aigree. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So I'm a great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Agreed. \nSPEAKER_09:  Um. \nSPEAKER_09:  really quick. I'm sorry to um \nSPEAKER_09:  bring this up. I'm only now just because my my node system is \nSPEAKER_09:  becoming more chaotic. \nSPEAKER_09:  by the day with all this but uh \nSPEAKER_09:  I only now as we've had this extended discussion about district aid. \nSPEAKER_09:  Did I want to \nSPEAKER_09:  Disclosed to the commission that I \nSPEAKER_09:  only when the candidates appeared for Zoom. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  interview. \nSPEAKER_09:  Did I recognize \nSPEAKER_09:  that Miss Ossuna can't have it 25. \nSPEAKER_09:  and I overlapped at law school. \nSPEAKER_09:  together and \nSPEAKER_09:  Obviously, we... \nSPEAKER_09:  evaluated these candidates with their names redacted and frankly \nSPEAKER_09:  when we received the \nSPEAKER_09:  Unredacted interview packets, the name did not. \nSPEAKER_09:  bring a bell for me, but when I \nSPEAKER_09:  Um \nSPEAKER_09:  Saw her a peer via zoom. \nSPEAKER_09:  We did overlap and so I recognized. \nSPEAKER_09:  her and to the best of my recollection we had no more than one or two kind of \nSPEAKER_09:  casual conversations. \nSPEAKER_09:  you know, with mutual acquaintances in law school. So \nSPEAKER_09:  I don't think that that \nSPEAKER_09:  colored my judgment in \nSPEAKER_09:  I was on the ad hoc committee that was assigned to district 8 was one of the \nSPEAKER_09:  the districts in my ad hoc committee. \nSPEAKER_09:  I don't think it obviously did not color my judgment then. \nSPEAKER_09:  I don't think it colored my judgment now. \nSPEAKER_09:  but I didn't want to disclose that. \nSPEAKER_09:  because, you know, again, I... \nSPEAKER_09:  to the extent I had met her at some point. \nSPEAKER_09:  previously. \nSPEAKER_09:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_06:  you \nSPEAKER_06:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yeah. That would be. \nSPEAKER_06:  You're being ethical. \nSPEAKER_09:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_06:  I mean, \nSPEAKER_00:  Commissioner, thank you for disclosing that. I think that it is it is significant that you let all of us know about that. I also think that \nSPEAKER_00:  in your summary by noting that this was a person that you didn't have a lot of contact with in law school that you were able to evaluate for credentials on paper without \nSPEAKER_00:  reference to her identity. \nSPEAKER_00:  and probably provided you with enough. \nSPEAKER_00:  with enough neutrality to be able to make the judgment that you did. \nSPEAKER_00:  So I think that I don't think that there's any kind of bias that has been established. \nSPEAKER_00:  If... if... if... \nSPEAKER_07:  I'd like to ask a question then, just a point of information. If we do know one of these, happen to know one of these candidates or have worked \nSPEAKER_07:  with them in some capacity. Should we disclose that? Because there's one candidate that I knew. I wasn't involved in the subcommittee that evaluated. \nSPEAKER_07:  district five but one of the candidates in five I did work with a long time ago on a nonprofit board and that's number 14 We have not stayed in touch \nSPEAKER_07:  but others may know. \nSPEAKER_06:  But I think given what this work is and given how active most of us are in the community, not other than Sharon digs Jackson, that was the only name that I recognized as I was going. \nSPEAKER_00:  night at \nSPEAKER_06:  That's that I really that closely with her. But I think it's to be expected that we might know somebody, which is part of the reason why we made the decision to review the applications with the names redacted so that we wouldn't have that. And also why we made the decision to review the applications. \nSPEAKER_06:  for districts other than the ones that we lived in knowing that there was a high probability that was going to be somebody in there, especially from the districts we live in, that we could know. So I've given, you know, this may be a big city, but the community is very small. I think there has to be an expectation that there's a possibility we're going to know somebody. And I think, I think, \nSPEAKER_00:  live it. \nSPEAKER_06:  Commissioner Fiedler also for being that open, but I think that has to be something that we expect going forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  and there. \nSPEAKER_07:  Well, the city attorney can comment as well, but also, I mean, we did one of the things we were interested in and was included in our essay was community involvement. And so people who are involved in the community, we learn their we learn their names because we see them involved in our community. So I think it. \nSPEAKER_07:  That's just how it's going to be. Your situation is a little different because you met the candidate in a context outside. Well, I don't know where everybody was when you met, but more or less outside the city. But do you think we're on okay ground here? \nSPEAKER_07:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would just, I just want to add one thing that, you know, with regard, I think we're talking about CD8 candidate 25, correct? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_09:  Thanks. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, and that candidate had \nSPEAKER_02:  six out of a sip. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_02:  six top two votes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Um. \nSPEAKER_02:  which put it way ahead of the other candidates in that field. So a lot of us had agreement with regard to that candidate. \nSPEAKER_04:  Yeah, I agree with that. I think disclosure is everything, and that should be noted. \nSPEAKER_04:  But even if you were to correct recuse. \nSPEAKER_04:  the vote stand. \nSPEAKER_00:  I, I, I, this is any, I think that's correct. I think all of the observations you, you have made. \nSPEAKER_00:  are correct. It's not reasonable to expect that you wouldn't know any of these candidates. \nSPEAKER_00:  I think the commission has taken. \nSPEAKER_00:  and staff have taken extraordinary steps to make sure that this process was as neutral and unbiased as it could. \nSPEAKER_00:  But that being said, it's also appropriate to disclose if you know someone so that it can be evaluated in the circumstances which exists. \nSPEAKER_09:  and thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_09:  And I apologize for not disclosing it at the beginning for our discussion from \nSPEAKER_09:  about council district 8. I've just, you know, like I said, got a lot of numbers in front of us. \nSPEAKER_09:  and um \nSPEAKER_09:  moving quickly and so it slipped my mind until \nSPEAKER_09:  until just then, so you know, eat. \nSPEAKER_09:  I'm happy to. \nSPEAKER_09:  I think we've already sort of established that the \nSPEAKER_09:  The numbers are what they are, but if the commission is more comfortable with me. \nSPEAKER_09:  kind of uh \nSPEAKER_09:  recusing myself from this mode. You know. \nSPEAKER_09:  Again, I apologize for not giving everyone the opportunity to weigh in on that before the numbers were advanced, but \nSPEAKER_09:  It only came to mind as I was then going back through my notes for our third candidate. \nSPEAKER_09:  that I realized. \nSPEAKER_09:  the situation. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now I don't think recusal is necessary and let for some reason you feel that you couldn't possibly be fair and based on the comments that you've made that doesn't seem to be the case. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_09:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's right. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  then. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think we've decided then we're going to move. \nSPEAKER_07:  for District 8, we're going to move. \nSPEAKER_07:  25, 20, and \nSPEAKER_07:  One. One. One. One. Right. Okay. 25, 20 and one. \nSPEAKER_01:  one. \nSPEAKER_07:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then let's move to District 9. And I think that would be starting with \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Pollock. \nSPEAKER_05:  31 and 24. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Manicky. \nSPEAKER_08:  you \nSPEAKER_08:  I also have 31 and 24 and also \nSPEAKER_08:  in the spirit of transparency and disclosing. I also know Silverney. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  in a professional capacity. \nSPEAKER_08:  as well as \nSPEAKER_08:  Milton Smith from District 2. So just for the record. \nSPEAKER_08:  I just want to say that I know. \nSPEAKER_08:  those two candidates. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um, \nSPEAKER_08:  The two candidates. \nSPEAKER_08:  guys! \nSPEAKER_08:  from District 9 and Milton from District 2. \nSPEAKER_10:  that CD9-31 and CD2-38. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  and knowing them in a professional capacity, you don't feel that you are biased towards them, Commissioner Manicast. \nSPEAKER_08:  No, and actually did similar to Commissioner Feedler was not aware of who they were until like in the process until. \nSPEAKER_08:  Um \nSPEAKER_08:  the actual interviews. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. I don't think that requires re-kissing. \nSPEAKER_00:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Commissioner Feedler, your choices on number nine. \nSPEAKER_09:  Yes, 24 and 31. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mr. D. Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_04:  24 and 31. \nSPEAKER_07:  Vice-chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_07:  2431. \nSPEAKER_07:  Mine are 31 and 24. \nSPEAKER_07:  and Commissioner Chatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  31 and 24. \nSPEAKER_07:  We will move 31 and 24 forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right, so what is the number that we've moved forward now? \nSPEAKER_03:  I count it 22. \nSPEAKER_07:  And could you... \nSPEAKER_07:  Remind us. \nSPEAKER_03:  Want me to go back to the district and 22? \nSPEAKER_07:  Number ticket number 32 \nSPEAKER_03:  Yeah, that would be good, I think. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, so CD one. \nSPEAKER_03:  19 and 21. \nSPEAKER_03:  CD2. \nSPEAKER_03:  3821 and five. \nSPEAKER_03:  CD3. \nSPEAKER_03:  11, 20 and 23. \nSPEAKER_03:  C-D-4. \nSPEAKER_03:  17 and 1. \nSPEAKER_03:  City five. \nSPEAKER_03:  36. \nSPEAKER_03:  14 and 42. \nSPEAKER_03:  in water. You are sitting there like you on TV now? Listen. Really linear than a \nSPEAKER_03:  34 \nSPEAKER_03:  19 and 11. \nSPEAKER_03:  mammoth giant supportive \ufffd knot. Jeffrey said many women are lonitary with ot microbes. You can figure it out fast and remain calm. It's easy to65 to liken these women to dentistry, ere majoreclusive mosque\u041d scholarship and massacres threat to \nSPEAKER_03:  1931. \nSPEAKER_03:  3D8 \nSPEAKER_03:  25. \nSPEAKER_03:  20 and 1. \nSPEAKER_03:  and CD9. \nSPEAKER_03:  31 and 24. \nSPEAKER_07:  Now, there was some discussion with reference to a couple of the districts about \nSPEAKER_07:  other candidates that where we thought there were, some people thought there were a lot of, or more than the number that we move forward that were good candidates. Do we want to go back at all? \nSPEAKER_07:  that to add anyone in. I thought there was District 1, I have note for candidate 24 and then I thought there were some others in candidate with a District 4 where people were saying they had \nSPEAKER_02:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Chair White, it might be helpful if we do that just to kind of just go through them by district. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  and we'll have a call if by district whether or not there's others that we've thought rated high. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  for this. \nSPEAKER_07:  let's give that loud down in a \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. So let's go back. That's a good idea I think. So let's go back to District 1. Like I said, my notes had candidate 24 as possibly moving forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  and I would support that, I have to say. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I would support that. \nSPEAKER_06:  As would I. \nSPEAKER_09:  That's fine with me. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Any one comment? I love that, so. Okay. District \nSPEAKER_05:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  I love you. \nSPEAKER_07:  any other comments on District 1? \nSPEAKER_07:  Then let's go to district two. We already have three candidates from district two. Is there anyone else that we want to move forward? \nSPEAKER_02:  I uh \nSPEAKER_02:  I wasn't one of my top two, but... \nSPEAKER_02:  candidate 34. \nSPEAKER_02:  was next in line and I thought. \nSPEAKER_02:  had good credentials. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we have three strong candidates in that district. I think we stay with the three that we have. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm fine with that. \nSPEAKER_07:  I thought 34 was a good candidate as well, I have to say. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  any other comments on district two. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right in district three. \nSPEAKER_04:  like the two that we proposed. \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree. \nSPEAKER_05:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  Great. \nSPEAKER_07:  any other comments on District 3? \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, district four. \nSPEAKER_06:  I think we were pretty unanimous in those two choices. So I think... \nSPEAKER_06:  We all agreed those were the two strongest. \nSPEAKER_02:  I think the only question I'd... \nSPEAKER_02:  I agree. I'm \nSPEAKER_02:  We honest with you, I'm thinking of the \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm mixed here. I'm thinking of \nSPEAKER_02:  potential candidates for the sub pool. \nSPEAKER_02:  uh... but you know what i know i agree with you you're right because only one of these \nSPEAKER_02:  two that we've selected will be selected. \nSPEAKER_02:  and I was, yeah, higher on. \nSPEAKER_02:  that person those two then I was the other. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Anything else on District 4? \nSPEAKER_07:  District five, we have three candidates going forward. Is there anyone else we want to. \nSPEAKER_07:  talk about. \nSPEAKER_02:  and you just give me two seconds. \nSPEAKER_02:  I'm good. \nSPEAKER_07:  anyone on district five? \nSPEAKER_07:  And district six, we have three candidates moving forward and I think \nSPEAKER_07:  was that the only we only had three candidates from District 6. Is that right? Yep. That showed up. Right? District 7, we had two candidates. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yep. \nSPEAKER_07:  Is there anyone else that we want to move forward? \nSPEAKER_02:  Can you give me a second for District 7? \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_05:  Sure. \nSPEAKER_02:  Oh nevermind, this is where I had the uh... \nSPEAKER_02:  at \nSPEAKER_02:  extra page. I'm good. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  Anyone else have any comments on District 7? \nSPEAKER_07:  In any, we'll go to district eight. We have three candidates moving forward. Is there anyone else that we want to discuss? \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_07:  And then District 9, we have two candidates moving forward. \nSPEAKER_07:  Any other comments? \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm not seeing any. \nSPEAKER_02:  Actually, can we go back to district 8 for just a second? \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay, I'm good. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  All right. \nSPEAKER_07:  Does anybody want to make any other suggestions about the \nSPEAKER_07:  as far as who the candidates should be that move forward. So this \nSPEAKER_07:  So then what we are going to need is a motion to move forward the candidates that we've selected from each district to move into the pool. \nSPEAKER_07:  for each district. And if they're not chosen in the draw, then those other names will go forward to the commissioners who are chosen to select the remaining four commissioners for the redistricting commission. \nSPEAKER_05:  I need a motion. \nSPEAKER_07:  You need a motion. \nSPEAKER_07:  I think we do and chair has a technical problem which is that I'm running out of electricity. We have better chairs. \nSPEAKER_05:  Yeah, I better check. You know, I'm okay for a while more. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'm going to do this. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_02:  And for clarification, our requirements were \nSPEAKER_02:  Our combined sub pool is to be between 20 and 30, correct? \nSPEAKER_04:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  correct. \nSPEAKER_02:  And right now, we're combining some pools at 23, correct? \nSPEAKER_07:  Yes. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  We'll be picking nine and they'll have 14 others to choose from. \nSPEAKER_07:  And I haven't looked back at the overall diversity of the group that we've selected, but I'm thinking that there's going to be a pretty representative based on the data that we had. \nSPEAKER_00:  that we have. \nSPEAKER_00:  Chair White, one amendment to the motion should be that we are going to observe the \nSPEAKER_00:  process that was discussed in item number two. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  So. \nSPEAKER_07:  Do we, does everyone have an understanding what the motion is or Amy do you want to restate the motion for us and then we'll call for the motion to be made? But that might make the most sense. \nSPEAKER_02:  I would prefer that. \nSPEAKER_00:  So as I understand it, there's a motion to move forward the 23 names that \nSPEAKER_00:  That. \nSPEAKER_00:  we \nSPEAKER_00:  You have discussed. \nSPEAKER_00:  according to the procedures that were discussed in the study session in item 2. \nSPEAKER_00:  \uae38 \nSPEAKER_00:  These names will be moved forward to the subcool. \nSPEAKER_07:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_07:  I'll move that. And do we have a second? \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_05:  we could do that. \nSPEAKER_07:  you \nSPEAKER_07:  All right, is there any further discussion on this item? \nSPEAKER_07:  Seeing none, would you call the role please? \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_07:  I hate you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_10:  I'm Snare Febler. \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Manicus. \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Pollack. \nSPEAKER_02:  I \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_10:  Commissioner Chattwell. \nSPEAKER_10:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_10:  Vice-chair Morales. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_10:  Bear Wise. \nSPEAKER_06:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_10:  Motion carries. \nSPEAKER_07:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_07:  And is there anything else that we need to do under item number three? \nSPEAKER_10:  No. \nSPEAKER_07:  Right. So the \nSPEAKER_07:  Item number four is the record."

And that requires a few logistical issues because we're going to use this machine that they have brought into the room that will juggle the balls around and from which the selection will be made. So I think we're going to take a break how much time do you think you need to, 10 minute break their staff is asking for so that they can arrange those logistics for us. So let's \nSPEAKER_02:  I ask a quick question for planning purposes. \nSPEAKER_01:  mm hmm. \nSPEAKER_02:  Ah. \nSPEAKER_02:  At once we resume, do we think it's going, do we have a guest from staff of we're talking 10, 20, 30 minutes? \nSPEAKER_02:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_03:  Now we're... \nSPEAKER_03:  Probably no more than an hour for sure. Um, but \nSPEAKER_03:  Is that enough for you or D-Nida more specific time? No. \nSPEAKER_02:  Nope, that's fine. I just wanted to make some arrangements. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, yeah, it shouldn't take too long. I'm thinking maybe like 30 minutes, but... \nSPEAKER_02:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll see how long the process of taking them all in and putting them in the machine and calling it out and everything. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  So we'll reconvene at 501. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm gonna check. \nSPEAKER_03:  So we'll just start it up again. \nSPEAKER_01:  So is this my life now? \nSPEAKER_01:  We can hear you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Great. OK. So we're in session again. \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, so this is item number four on the agenda for today. And this is the item to appoint the \nSPEAKER_01:  First nine members of the redistricting commission won from each district based on the applicants whose names were chosen to go into the sub district pools during our earlier session that we that we were just in. I believe there were some comments and questions by some of the commissioners before we begin this portion of the selection process. \nSPEAKER_01:  Commissioner Chatwell. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, I just had asked a question, if based on our sub, our combined sub pools. \nSPEAKER_02:  if it would be appropriate to do, just not by each district, but do a diversity check to make sure that we have a diverse \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah, \nSPEAKER_02:  pool of candidates. \nSPEAKER_01:  I think the city clerk has a chart from which he may be able to provide a general idea of where we are in those categories. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yet so I'm looking at attachment V of the staff report. \nSPEAKER_03:  Give me one second. \nSPEAKER_03:  It looks like we have a range of different diversities for the race and ethnicities. \nSPEAKER_01:  How about gender? \nSPEAKER_03:  for gender. \nSPEAKER_03:  We do have a mix of females, males, and one individual who identifies as non-binary. \nSPEAKER_03:  or a-off? \nSPEAKER_02:  Thanks for watching! \nSPEAKER_03:  I'm sorry. \nSPEAKER_03:  Go ahead. \nSPEAKER_02:  I also believe we have a mixture of based on sexual orientation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have diversity of regarding sexual orientation. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, and it also looks like we have a few different people from different age ranges as well. \nSPEAKER_00:  You have, um, \nSPEAKER_00:  Two Asians or three Asians. \nSPEAKER_00:  in your \nSPEAKER_03:  I have two people that identify as Asian Pacific Islander. \nSPEAKER_03:  and then additional one who identifies as multiple ethnicity, Hispanic and Asian. \nSPEAKER_03:  Do any of the commissioners have any other questions regarding the \nSPEAKER_03:  possible diversity. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are there any other questions by the commissioners before we proceed with the random selection? \nSPEAKER_01:  I'm now. \nSPEAKER_00:  Now. \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_01:  Seeing none, then this is what we're going to be doing. The city clerk will call out the numbers. \nSPEAKER_01:  The numbers are on these balls that have been premarked by the staff. I will show the ball. \nSPEAKER_01:  I will put the ball in the box. \nSPEAKER_01:  went all the back. \nSPEAKER_01:  All the balls for the particular district are in the box. I'll close the box, turn the machine on. \nSPEAKER_01:  the machine will shuffle the balls and produce one ball up here which I will take. \nSPEAKER_01:  and read the number and the city clerk will then match it to the name of the candidate because he has all that data in front of him and I don't have that right here. \nSPEAKER_01:  So that's the procedure that I think we've agreed upon. Does anybody have any questions about that before we proceed? \nSPEAKER_01:  Okay, let's go. \nSPEAKER_03:  Okay, for our first council district, we'll be council district one. We have CD1-19. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have CD1-21. \nSPEAKER_03:  and CD1-24. \nSPEAKER_01:  The selection is a candidate CD-121. \nSPEAKER_03:  Canada CD1-21 is Eric Oats. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll be moving on to Council District 2. \nSPEAKER_03:  Council District 2 will be CD2-5. \nSPEAKER_03:  CD2-21 \nSPEAKER_03:  and CD2-38. \nSPEAKER_00:  The candidate for District 2 is candidate 38. \nSPEAKER_03:  Canada CD2-38 is Milton Smith. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll move on to county district three. \nSPEAKER_03:  Our first applicant is CD3-11. \nSPEAKER_03:  Our next applicant is CD3-23. \nSPEAKER_01:  The candidate for CD3 is number 11. \nSPEAKER_03:  Canada CD3-11 is Thomas Cooper. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll move on to Council District 4. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have CD4-1. \nSPEAKER_03:  And the next candidate is CD4-17. \nSPEAKER_01:  The candidate for CD4 is number 17. \nSPEAKER_03:  and I did CD4-17 is Nicole Lopez. \nSPEAKER_03:  We'll move on to Canada, or I'm sorry, Council District 5. \nSPEAKER_03:  First we have CD5-14. \nSPEAKER_03:  We have CD5-36. \nSPEAKER_03:  and CD5-42. \nSPEAKER_01:  The candidate for CD5 is number 14. \nSPEAKER_03:  Canada's CD5-14 is Sharon Diggs-Jaxon. \nSPEAKER_03:  Moving on to Council District 6, the first applicant.

So is there any discussion about that? \nSPEAKER_01:  I would just add that I believe this is some of this information has already been transmitted but I would suggest that the report also include the information about the process that was followed and perhaps a report on the diversity as well since we have that data. \nSPEAKER_03:  Yes, we can include that. \nSPEAKER_01:  Are there any other comments or questions on this item? \nSPEAKER_01:  All right, then I'll call the question or ask for the role call vote. \nSPEAKER_03:  We get a mover in seconder. \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_01:  Sorry. \nSPEAKER_00:  I'll move Commissioner Morales. \nSPEAKER_01:  I'll second. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  Now may we have the roll call please. \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Dave Benedictis. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Commissioner Febler. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Manicus. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Pollack. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Mr. Nershotwell. \nSPEAKER_03:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Nice chair, Maralis. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  Chair White. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_03:  motion carried. \nSPEAKER_01:  Does anyone have anything else further on item number four?"
