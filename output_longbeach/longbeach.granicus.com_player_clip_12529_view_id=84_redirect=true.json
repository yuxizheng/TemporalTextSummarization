Okay, Madam Clark, can you please read item three? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, item three is a recommendation to receive and file the presentation on battery charging stations and hydrogen filling stations. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. Okay, so let's start with a staff report for the site and please. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you chair. We've got April Walker. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  for all of you. \nSPEAKER_03:  project management officer from Public Works to give your presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Good afternoon, Sharon. Committee. I'm really excited. \nSPEAKER_02:  to give you a presentation today. Can you hear me? \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, yes. Okay, great. Thank you so much. \nSPEAKER_02:  So we'll go ahead to the next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So staff put together a presentation highlighting cities hydrogen fuel stations city EV Charger Network, which will get into details regarding cities a fleet city owns public EV chargers privately owned public EV chargers and the future of citywide EV charging network. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we will also briefly discuss upcoming studies related to the EV Charging Network Citywide for both public and private. \nSPEAKER_02:  owners. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in working with the fleet services team in identifying hydrogen fuel stations, they advise that the city does not currently own any hydrogen fuel stations and the map provided here has locations of hydrogen fuel stations within Los Angeles and Orange counties. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the city's electric fleet vehicle currently operates under 72 light duty electric vehicles, which are primarily Chevy bolts. \nSPEAKER_02:  We have 105 level two active charge, uh, chargers, sorry, there's a typo there. \nSPEAKER_02:  points dedicated just to city vehicles at various locations. ZY. \nSPEAKER_02:  locations include wheat services, which is our main hub, but we also have chargers at hell. \nSPEAKER_02:  PD, library and park sites and that's growing. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  The city owns public charters, which are charters available to public. \nSPEAKER_02:  on city owned property, we have 134 public charging ports and 6 DC fast charger locations. And so just to quickly highlight, the DC fast chargers do charge as it is indicated in the name at a rate much faster than level two, but not all DC fast chargers are compatible with every EB out there. So we are looking to grow the DC fast charging network, but we want to be mindful of the compatibility with public users and their vehicles. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so these are just a few pictures of chargers at various city-owned locations. You'll see at the multi-service center we have two. We have several at the Nipro Beach lots. We also have other beach locks like Alamedos, once Alamedos concessions. \nSPEAKER_02:  reopen is they'll have new charters there and I'll get into this later but we are looking to roll out our goal is to have charters at every beach lot location in citywide. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then here you'll see chargers in the near to a lot. This is right off second street. So it's right off those surface lots right behind the businesses off second street. And those are the BFC fast chargers. And we do find that we have a lot of residents using these as well as the public, you know, conducting business on second streets. So we're really glad to see that these are becoming valuable to visitors and residents within the community. \nSPEAKER_00:  and those are \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So in order to communicate the city owned public EV Chargers, public works has a dedicated page just to our EV charging network. We have a little bit of information on city, the city charging program. We have highlights of how to pay, although we know that are we find that EV drivers are very well versed in in the various. \nSPEAKER_02:  equipment out there for charging. We have our charging rates, which is part of our fee schedule. \nSPEAKER_02:  And other information related to charging, you know, like, \nSPEAKER_02:  parking while charging is free, but we do implement fees so that people don't keep their cars parked in one single stall. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then we have a map of all of the city's charging locations that are city owned and on public property. You'll note that you will not see. \nSPEAKER_02:  I don't believe we have the airport here. Those are currently offline. We're working the airport team to convert all of their blank chargers to charge point. And then the very bottom on the right image. You'll see that we have links that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Users can go to the private Leon Charter, so if you go to Plunch Air, you'll see the entire network of Charters available to the public that are also in private properties. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  And here's the highlight when you click on the plug, share it with me. This is what you'll see. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so our goal is to provide \nSPEAKER_02:  our EV charging drivers, our EV drivers with the network of really in charge of the citywide. \nSPEAKER_00:  Our e. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next like please. \nSPEAKER_02:  So the big question is, what is the future of the cities you need charging network? \nSPEAKER_02:  In my experience, and speaking with other municipalities and other charging programs, the city is actually a leader in the region and our ED charging network, but we know that given upcoming legislation that we will definitely need to continue to grow this. So we have a partnership. \nSPEAKER_02:  through the Clean Pop-Way Community Program with Southern California Edison. \nSPEAKER_02:  And one of the objectives with this group is the transportation and electrification expansion. And this touches on fleet supports ports effort. But one item that I really want to highlight that's really going to be valuable to the city is SCE's charge ready program. \nSPEAKER_02:  The chart ready program provides the infrastructure to support the expansion of the ZEB. So they will trench and conduit basically everything to the point where they say, okay, city, we're done. Now you have to come in and plug and play have charge point and solve the units themselves. This saves a significant cost to the city for the infrastructure, which is typically the most expensive part of the project because they also cover the planning and permitting and they have a dedicated project manager. To lead that ever. \nSPEAKER_02:  Second theory is that \nSPEAKER_02:  If charging is, if a location is in a disadvantaged community, the city also receives $2,900 in rebates per unit and each unit counts for two ports. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so the city was part of SCE's Chargerty pilot program. We had actually five sites accepted by SCE through a pilot program. Those have all been successfully implemented. \nSPEAKER_02:  which are public and sleep. \nSPEAKER_02:  totaling over 340 ports. Now it's going to be at least one to one and a half years until we would see construction happen. We're working actively with our account manager on the application review process. So this number will definitely change, but we basically just threw the entire kitchen sink and said, let's see how much we can get so we can really ramp up and grow our AV charging number. \nSPEAKER_02:  That's like these. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide please. \nSPEAKER_02:  And so we have upcoming studies. We have a CEC grant in the amount of $200,000 that will \nSPEAKER_02:  provide support for the city to develop a blueprint for mid-Judy and heavy duty ZED infrastructure which will be a collaboration with city-ride stakeholders so not just within the city and the port and the airport and water but also LVSD, LVCC, Cal State Long Beach and our community. \nSPEAKER_02:  This is going to be led by the Public Works team. \nSPEAKER_02:  And then there is a secondary study at EV Charging Study, which is funded through a grant from SCAG, and it will focus on employer workplace charging, well-to-unit dwelling charging and public charging. And that is going to be led through the opposite of sustainability. \nSPEAKER_02:  Next slide. \nSPEAKER_02:  And that concludes my presentation today. And I'm happy to answer any questions that I may have the information to share with you today on. Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  awesome thank you April. Can I get a motion on this item before we go to discussion in public comment please? \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm moved. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'll second. \nSPEAKER_04:  Alright, and then so I just I have a \nSPEAKER_04:  and I mean I'll second. I do have a few comments and questions you know before we start so I just wanted to say thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Ms. Walker for this presentation. \nSPEAKER_04:  I know that. \nSPEAKER_04:  one of the biggest issues with switching to zero emission vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  is the development of the fueling infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this comprehensive presentation was very helpful. \nSPEAKER_04:  to me and to many residents, I'm sure. So thank you for that. \nSPEAKER_04:  I also want to remind folks that our current gasoline fueling infrastructure took decades. \nSPEAKER_04:  to build out in our community. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I'm happy to see. \nSPEAKER_04:  these maps of where residents can charge. \nSPEAKER_04:  and fuel zero mission vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  And the dedicated page to the EV chargers is also helpful as well. I'm sure. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  I would love to know more about what we can do. \nSPEAKER_04:  to promote the availability. \nSPEAKER_04:  of our zero emission vehicle fueling infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  And I'd also like \nSPEAKER_04:  to be updated on future expansions and charging and fueling infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  as those projects come in, including the E, the bike charging, \nSPEAKER_04:  the battery electric vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  the hydrogen vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  and projects like the Wave and Duckip Charging Station on Pine. \nSPEAKER_04:  in front of the convention center. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, our city is seeing a good progress and I want \nSPEAKER_04:  to be sure or \nSPEAKER_04:  promoting our progress so people start to understand that. \nSPEAKER_04:  that it may be easier to switch to zero emission vehicles. I also have to put a plug in for Mr. Connor who also dries a hydrogen car. \nSPEAKER_04:  Kudos to Mr. Connor. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  But I do have a few, I just have some quick questions as well. I know that. \nSPEAKER_04:  Southern California Edison has a program to install. \nSPEAKER_04:  chargers and in multi-family dwellings. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so sometimes the future can you give us an update on the state? \nSPEAKER_04:  of the multi-family charging \nSPEAKER_04:  initiatives in Long Beach. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yes, so I can speak very high level to that effort because it is actually part of charge ready round two. \nSPEAKER_02:  So Chargerity Round 2 is open to both public and private groups. And they do, and I can't recall because I'm not in the space, but they do have minimum requirements that \nSPEAKER_02:  targets, multi-it duolings and those in disadvantaged communities. So we can come back and, you know, I'd be happy to coordinate a presentation on charge ready to focus on that from the SET themselves that you would like. \nSPEAKER_04:  That would be wonderful. Thank you so much, Miss Walker. \nSPEAKER_02:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  So also, is there any other comments or questions? \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  hearing notes. \nSPEAKER_03:  Also I'm in. \nSPEAKER_04:  Mall \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  Oh. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Okay, Mary, are you muted? \nSPEAKER_01:  Yes, I was sorry about that. Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you, April, so much for that wonderful and uplifting presentation. This always gets me excited. I remember when I was on Long Beach, Toronto, and we brought, you know, our zero emission buses into the city. And one of the most challenging things was to have where are we going to put the chargers? How are we going to charge the buses? So this really is exciting and step to be able to be thinking about this moving forward on this plan is super exciting. So thank you for a great presentation. And I look forward to that report as well as chair Allen had requested. So that's a really great idea. Thank you chair Allen. \nSPEAKER_00:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_01:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  and then councilwoman, I think that we stay see Manga also house. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_03:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_03:  I just wanted to thank April. I've worked on these Edison grants at the county level and they are not an easy task. The number of people on the Edison side that are available to help you go through the process is constantly a high turnover because they have so many staffing shortages like all of us are having. And so I know it is not. \nSPEAKER_03:  easy and the fact that you're staying on target is pretty impressive. So congratulations and thank you for your work on this. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much. Thank you colleagues for your comments on this. And are there any public comments? \nSPEAKER_00:  No public comments, chair. \nSPEAKER_04:  All right. Can I please have a vote? \nSPEAKER_00:  Yes, Councilwoman Zindey has. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_00:  Nice to your mongo. \nSPEAKER_00:  you \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_00:  Bye. \nSPEAKER_04:  you \nSPEAKER_00:  You're Ellen. \nSPEAKER_04:  Sing it loud. \nSPEAKER_00:  Russian carries. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  Let's go ahead. Let's go to item. I don't know if we're ready."

Sorry, I had to change my background. I didn't realize that was at the beach. \nSPEAKER_04:  uh \nSPEAKER_04:  Anyway, let me uh \nSPEAKER_04:  Pull up the slides here just a moment. \nSPEAKER_04:  Alright, so I think that should be working. Is that coming through on your end. \nSPEAKER_02:  Yeah. \nSPEAKER_04:  Great. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to the committee today. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm going to provide just a high level overview of some of the things going on at the state and the federal levels. \nSPEAKER_04:  related to sustainability and \nSPEAKER_04:  specifically investments in renewable energy production. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I figured what would be helpful to do. \nSPEAKER_04:  to start out with. \nSPEAKER_04:  is to just give a... \nSPEAKER_04:  and update on kind of where we're at with our legislative agenda. \nSPEAKER_04:  and some of the priorities that are already outlined. \nSPEAKER_04:  in our 2021 legislative agendas at the state and federal levels. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we have \nSPEAKER_04:  a number of items in the agenda is related to supporting \nSPEAKER_04:  improvements in air quality, environmental sustainability. \nSPEAKER_04:  and more direct objectives in our agendas about supporting legislation that will help reduce. \nSPEAKER_04:  air pollutants and emissions in particular. \nSPEAKER_04:  We also know that of course transportation is one of the \nSPEAKER_04:  largest challenges in terms of \nSPEAKER_04:  air quality and pollution in the region. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we have an item in the agenda around supporting active transportation multi-modal \nSPEAKER_04:  transportation infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  Transit oriented development. \nSPEAKER_04:  and also just the development of local transportation infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  that will help to reduce \nSPEAKER_04:  air quality challenges that we face locally. \nSPEAKER_04:  We have items in the agenda as well around supporting energy resilience. \nSPEAKER_04:  resiliency. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this means supporting programs and funding that will advance. \nSPEAKER_04:  things that April was just talking about and others such as solar and alternative energy resources, conversion technology to minimize landfilling. I know we had of course a study session at council recently about our organics waste process as well as then \nSPEAKER_04:  what April was just talking about, our electric charging priorities. \nSPEAKER_04:  And then last, I think relevant to this item would be some items. \nSPEAKER_04:  or lines in our agenda related to. \nSPEAKER_04:  stormwater management. \nSPEAKER_04:  water conservation and improving water quality. \nSPEAKER_04:  and sustainability more generally. \nSPEAKER_04:  This just gives a high level overview of \nSPEAKER_04:  from the advocacy side. What are some of the priorities that we push for at both the state and federal levels related to sustainability? \nSPEAKER_04:  and renewable energy. \nSPEAKER_04:  in particular. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so \nSPEAKER_04:  also related, you know, our advocacy efforts are \nSPEAKER_04:  intimately connected to \nSPEAKER_04:  Trying to advance our climate action and adaptation plan? \nSPEAKER_04:  I know you all are of course very familiar with the cat. \nSPEAKER_04:  But I wanted to highlight a few of the items in the cap that I think are relevant to this agenda item today. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that would be efforts to advance. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, our building and energy conservation. \nSPEAKER_04:  creating more carbon-free. \nSPEAKER_04:  renewable energy resources for \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, existing facilities and buildings. \nSPEAKER_04:  advancing carbon neutral buildings and construction. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's also an interest in \nSPEAKER_04:  advancing other transportation. \nSPEAKER_04:  Priorities related to. \nSPEAKER_04:  decreasing the reliance on personal motor vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  shifting to lower or zero emissions vehicles like we were just talking about. \nSPEAKER_04:  as well as \nSPEAKER_04:  prioritizing transit oriented development and \nSPEAKER_04:  never had that have. \nSPEAKER_04:  public transit and alternative modes of transportation. \nSPEAKER_04:  So. \nSPEAKER_04:  All of this is just kind of a framing of what are some of the things that we're tracking. \nSPEAKER_04:  and prioritizing from the council direction. \nSPEAKER_04:  related to sustainability. \nSPEAKER_04:  and renewables. \nSPEAKER_04:  in terms of at the state level. \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, obviously California is one of the... \nSPEAKER_04:  Global leaders, I would say. \nSPEAKER_04:  sustainability and advancing environmental protections. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so just last year, Governor Newsom. \nSPEAKER_04:  announced the state's plan to require by 2035. \nSPEAKER_04:  that all new cars and passenger trucks. \nSPEAKER_04:  sold in California are going to be zero emissions. \nSPEAKER_04:  Be cool. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we know obviously that transportation accounts for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and this would be one of the steps that the state is taking. \nSPEAKER_04:  to develop strategies. \nSPEAKER_04:  too. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know \nSPEAKER_04:  decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. \nSPEAKER_04:  through the sale of zero emissions cars by 25. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  Also, the California Air Resources Board. \nSPEAKER_04:  adopted the innovative clean transit regulation in 2018. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this calls for all transit agencies in California. \nSPEAKER_04:  to have 100% zero emissions fleet by 24. \nSPEAKER_04:  The city's public transportation provider Long Beach Transit. \nSPEAKER_04:  as a goal of reaching that 100% zero mission fleet by 23rd. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we're going to see, of course, locally and statewide. \nSPEAKER_04:  a big push in initiative to get to zero emissions. \nSPEAKER_04:  in our public transportation sector as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  Lastly, just earlier this year, the governor announced. \nSPEAKER_04:  also that the California Air Resources Board \nSPEAKER_04:  will be analyzing different pathways to phase out oil extraction and production. \nSPEAKER_04:  in California by no later than 2045. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this will take place over the next couple of years through the Climate Change Scoping Plan. \nSPEAKER_04:  the state's comprehensive. \nSPEAKER_04:  programmatic plan to achieve required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. \nSPEAKER_04:  So again, these are just some high level targets that I wanted to. \nSPEAKER_04:  share with the committee to make sure that you're aware of some of the things going on at the state level. \nSPEAKER_04:  and how they align at the local level as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  And we just provided an update memo to the mayor and council. \nSPEAKER_04:  as well as a presentation to our \nSPEAKER_04:  State Legislature Committee last week about the state budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  I wanted to highlight. \nSPEAKER_04:  There are a number of items I think that are relevant to this agenda item. \nSPEAKER_04:  in the FY22 state budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  that are specifically targeting significant in historic investments. \nSPEAKER_04:  in programs and projects related to. \nSPEAKER_04:  water and drought resilience. \nSPEAKER_04:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_04:  zero emissions vehicles and charging infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  climate change resilience programs, especially in disadvantaged communities. \nSPEAKER_04:  as well as funding for cleaning up contaminated properties, especially, you know, \nSPEAKER_04:  in Southeast LA and in other parts of the state. \nSPEAKER_04:  And as a follow up, I know council was very interested. \nSPEAKER_04:  when we had our study session on organics waste. \nSPEAKER_04:  in what the state is doing to help support. \nSPEAKER_04:  local agencies in meeting the statewide organics requirements through SB 1383. \nSPEAKER_04:  So there is 250 million proposed in the budget. \nSPEAKER_04:  that will \nSPEAKER_04:  hopefully be developed into support. \nSPEAKER_04:  and resources for organics waste. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that will help, of course, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and methane and so on. \nSPEAKER_04:  similar to what our cap priority saw. \nSPEAKER_04:  But those details of the funding will be forthcoming. They're developing the cap and trade funding plan over the next months and potentially weeks. So we will know more information about how that funding aligns with our local priorities related to greenhouse gas emissions and waste management as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  So at the federal level, there are also a number of \nSPEAKER_04:  bills and proposals that I wanted to share with the committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  things that we're tracking. \nSPEAKER_04:  that I think are of interest of course to this agenda item. \nSPEAKER_04:  The first I know we'll have \nSPEAKER_04:  more of a presentation later about \nSPEAKER_04:  the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  But essentially what this would do. \nSPEAKER_04:  is it would place a fee on the production and use of carbon or fossil fuels. So it would target the fee at the source and the importers of fossil fuels. \nSPEAKER_04:  Currently, it would be set at $15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, but it would increase over, you know, year by year to us. \nSPEAKER_04:  fairly significant fee on the production of fossil fuels. \nSPEAKER_04:  with the hope of \nSPEAKER_04:  decreasing and getting to net zero carbon pollution by 2050. \nSPEAKER_04:  What would happen with that fee is they would be \nSPEAKER_04:  Basically providing a dividend or they would distribute those revenues from the fee. \nSPEAKER_04:  to people in monthly installments. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this would essentially be \nSPEAKER_04:  sort of like a basic income program. \nSPEAKER_04:  leveraging. \nSPEAKER_04:  the carbon fee that's \nSPEAKER_04:  installed for the producers of \nSPEAKER_04:  and in quarters of fossil fuels. \nSPEAKER_04:  So I know again, we'll have a more detailed presentation on that item later. \nSPEAKER_04:  But of course, this is one of the. \nSPEAKER_04:  high profile bills. \nSPEAKER_04:  that we're tracking at the federal level. \nSPEAKER_04:  Another one is the Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nations Future Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  say that 10 times fast, but essentially the clean future app. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this would \nSPEAKER_04:  basically provide \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, specific policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a number of different sectors. \nSPEAKER_04:  So for the power sector, it would include a clean electricity standard. \nSPEAKER_04:  that would be required for all retail electricity supplies to obtain 100% clean electricity by 2035. \nSPEAKER_04:  In building, they would set energy and water savings targets for federal buildings and \nSPEAKER_04:  also provide funding for schools, homes, and municipal buildings. \nSPEAKER_04:  to improve energy and water efficiency. \nSPEAKER_04:  for transportation the bill would provide substantial investments in transportation electrification. \nSPEAKER_04:  and in ways to also establish programs to invest in. \nSPEAKER_04:  community level zero waste initiatives. \nSPEAKER_04:  and improve education and outreach. \nSPEAKER_04:  around voice reduction. \nSPEAKER_04:  A couple other proposals. One of them is the medium and heavy duty electric vehicle infrastructure act and that's from one of our representatives congresswoman bear gone and this bill would. \nSPEAKER_04:  Basically create a rebate program to promote the purchase and installation of electric vehicle supply equipment. \nSPEAKER_04:  in charging equipment. \nSPEAKER_04:  for medium and heavy duty electric vehicles. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this would be if passed approved or authorized $250 million over several years for this rebate program. \nSPEAKER_04:  The Offshore Wind, John's and Opportunity Act is another \nSPEAKER_04:  proposal of course related to renewable energy production. \nSPEAKER_04:  And this would create a career training program or a grant program to facilitate workforce development in offshore wind. \nSPEAKER_04:  careers and you know kind of a burgeoning sector when it comes to \nSPEAKER_04:  renewable energy resources. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this could potentially have passed. \nSPEAKER_04:  support. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, an expansion of some of our workforce development opportunities. \nSPEAKER_04:  locally and regionally as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  And last, I just wanted to emphasize the clean energy and sustainability accelerator act. \nSPEAKER_04:  So this essentially would provide. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know what? \nSPEAKER_04:  clean energy and sustainability. \nSPEAKER_04:  opportunity for investments in public and private funds to advance clean energy technologies and infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  The legislation would also provide funding to establish and support green banks to invest in reducing carbon emissions and other community projects around environmental equity. \nSPEAKER_04:  Just a couple more slides that I wanted to put some of those bills into context. \nSPEAKER_04:  We know that at the federal level, it's a little bit different than the state level usually. \nSPEAKER_04:  in a sense that a number of those proposals that I was just talking about. \nSPEAKER_04:  I'm \nSPEAKER_04:  You know, may not be taking up independently this year. \nSPEAKER_04:  But instead, of course, the focus has been on the much larger. \nSPEAKER_04:  infrastructure package. \nSPEAKER_04:  that Congress is negotiating currentment. \nSPEAKER_04:  So we'll have a much more comprehensive update on that. \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, infrastructure conversation council, I believe in the next week or two. \nSPEAKER_04:  But just a high level update here on kind of what some of the proposals are related to renewables. In the house, the house has approved their five year \nSPEAKER_04:  reauthorization for infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  And that's called the Invest in America Act. \nSPEAKER_04:  This obviously has a number of different funding priorities, but related to climate change. \nSPEAKER_04:  and carbon emissions reductions. \nSPEAKER_04:  There are significant funding opportunities for \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, investing in... \nSPEAKER_04:  carbon reductions, greenhouse gas reductions for transportation infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  for investing in EV charging infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  as well as expanding pedestrian bike and multi-modal \nSPEAKER_04:  streets and infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's funding also for zero emissions buses, of course, just expanding on the statewide and local efforts to transition to zero emissions public transportation. \nSPEAKER_04:  as well as, you know, inline with our cap. \nSPEAKER_04:  and our legislative agenda, increasing funding and incentives for transit oriented development. So all of these \nSPEAKER_04:  are in the house. \nSPEAKER_04:  past bill, the investment America. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um. \nSPEAKER_04:  but \nSPEAKER_04:  moving simultaneously is the bipartisan infrastructure act which \nSPEAKER_04:  We provided a memo a couple of weeks ago as well as \nSPEAKER_04:  you know, some regular updates to the Infrastructure Committee. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  We don't know exactly how the large federal infrastructure act will \nSPEAKER_04:  really land and where the House Bill and this bipartisan Senate bill will. \nSPEAKER_04:  how they will be. \nSPEAKER_04:  essentially \nSPEAKER_04:  how they will figure out the differences between the two bills. \nSPEAKER_04:  But even in this bipartisan act. \nSPEAKER_04:  There's also significant and historic investments in renewables and environmental sustainability. \nSPEAKER_04:  including 7.5 billion for developing a nationwide, sorry. \nSPEAKER_04:  network of EV chargers. \nSPEAKER_04:  Um, \nSPEAKER_04:  funding also for reducing transportation related carbon emissions. \nSPEAKER_04:  developing smart or sort of smart cities type of infrastructure development. \nSPEAKER_04:  to reduce not only public safety issues, but \nSPEAKER_04:  carbon emissions as well. \nSPEAKER_04:  There would be investments in zero emissions bus grants, grid resiliency programs, and also investments in clean energy. \nSPEAKER_04:  and \nSPEAKER_04:  regional clean hydrogen hubs and so on. \nSPEAKER_04:  There are significant investments potentially in this large federal infrastructure package. \nSPEAKER_04:  And so we'd be happy to talk a little bit more about that process and where we're at. \nSPEAKER_04:  but essentially, I just wanted to give a high level overview. \nSPEAKER_04:  of some of those priorities that we're seeing in the legislation. \nSPEAKER_04:  at both the state and federal level. So with that, I will \nSPEAKER_04:  pause and be happy to answer any questions. \nSPEAKER_02:  Awesome. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you very much. But before we go to discussion and public comment, can I please get a motion in a second? \nSPEAKER_01:  Bye man! \nSPEAKER_02:  I'll second. I do have a couple comments just to start. Just thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Dr. Curly, this was \nSPEAKER_02:  such an informative presentation and boy. \nSPEAKER_02:  You guys are busy. So it's just, it's wonderful. \nSPEAKER_02:  to see what is already in a legislative agenda to promote these very important sustainable priorities. \nSPEAKER_02:  And there's so much coming up and I'm hopeful for more funding. \nSPEAKER_02:  to future proof our energy infrastructure. \nSPEAKER_02:  And I hope that we can speed up our \nSPEAKER_02:  climate change resilience. I'm also really happy to hear about your bill. \nSPEAKER_02:  on imported fossil fuels. \nSPEAKER_02:  because I have been, I've been talking about that and I'm really was \nSPEAKER_02:  Why haven't we done that? So I can slow my role because I know you're on it. So thank you so much for that. \nSPEAKER_02:  Do we have any other \nSPEAKER_02:  comments or questions from the committee. \nSPEAKER_01:  Thank you, Dr. Curly, for that great presentation again. And did a little with it. \nSPEAKER_01:  everything that chair Allen said, especially when it comes to fossil fuels that importers of fossil fuels, I think that's going to be great, especially being \nSPEAKER_01:  you know. \nSPEAKER_01:  Our city is based on oil. How do we move towards? \nSPEAKER_01:  towards um \nSPEAKER_01:  or away from that and I think that this is a great opportunity and I'm really excited and I hope that it passes soon so thank you thank you very much for that great presentation. \nSPEAKER_02:  Excellent presentation. Just echo what my colleague said. \nSPEAKER_02:  Thank you. \nSPEAKER_02:  Well, I thank you very much. Madam Clerk, is there any public comments on this item? \nSPEAKER_00:  No public comment here. \nSPEAKER_02:  Heidi, can I please call for a vote? \nSPEAKER_00:  Councilwoman Zendai-Haz. \nSPEAKER_00:  I \nSPEAKER_00:  I'm sorry.
